AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;
      previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease
      (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is 
      a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health
      Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been
      identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China.
      On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health
      emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two
      bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 
      and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or 
      direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period
      of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with
      pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), 
      fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement 
      with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography
      images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is
      responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China.
      Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the
      primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep
      monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus
      and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

TI  - Repurposing of clinically approved drugs for treatment of coronavirus disease
      2019 in a 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related coronavirus model.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000797 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV
      requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those
      without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to
      repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV
      related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether
      GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was
      investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. 
      The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 
      2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were
      screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by
      GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential 
      drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles
      were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and
      plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V
      shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and
      uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three
      drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited
      complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 mumol/L. CEP
      demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration
      for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 mumol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells
      treated with 10 mumol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP
      treatment ([6.48 +/- 0.02] x 10vs. 1.00 +/- 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h 
      post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media
      containing 10 mumol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent
      antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 +/- 0.37 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.12, t
      = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 +/- 0.43 vs. [6.18 +/- 0.95] x 10, 
      t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable
      model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are
      potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest
      that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial 
      of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.

AB  - As of 22 February 2020, more than 77662 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have been
      documented globally with over 2360 deaths. Common presentations of confirmed
      cases include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum
      production, shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged
      prothrombin time, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate
      dehydrogenase. The reported severe/critical case ratio is approximately 7-10% and
      median time to intensive care admission is 9.5-10.5 days with mortality of around
      1-2% varied geographically. Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus,
      there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed
      the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid
      and supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial. In China,
      Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial
      guidelines with substantial utilization. We reviewed the latest national and
      provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series
      regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine. We have also
      reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management with
      hypothesized mechanisms and latest in silico findings to identify candidate
      Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management. Given 
      the paucity of strongly evidence-based regimens, the available data suggest that 
      Chinese medicine could be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic option in the
      management of COVID-19.

AB  - So far, there is a lack of effective drugs for the new coronavirus pneumonia.
      With more and more patients diagnosed, China has carried out more than 100
      clinical studies of new coronavirus infection, including antiviral drugs,
      antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, virus vaccine, and other
      Western drugs, while Chinese medicine research accounted for half of the studies.
      Most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period would
      last for 1 to 11 months. The primary endpoints included symptom improvement and
      virus nucleic acid turning negative, but the optimal endpoint has not been
      determined. Although the final results of studies will take a long time to
      complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent 
      demand for drug treatment. Compared with that of during SARS period in 2003,
      China has the stronger capability to carry out clinical trials of new drugs in
      emergency period.

AB  - The continued emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases with a
      high case fatality rate stresses the need for the availability of effective
      antiviral treatments. Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus
      (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of
      prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of 
      MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment
      initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced
      clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues,
      and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment
      initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a
      reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and
      decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support 
      testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical
      trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including
      the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
