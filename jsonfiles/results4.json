The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)\nin 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first\ncentury.

Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to beta-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus\nuses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported\ncases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying\ndiseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China\n(Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online\nair travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number\nof travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the\nrisk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in\n168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97).

This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical\ncharacteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data on the global\noutbreak of \"2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV\" were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information\nfrom research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS:\nWorldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%)\nfatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019.

Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding\nof this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral\ninfection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by\nconsidering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe\nAcute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that\nCOVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein\nand surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has\nsimilar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19\nhas nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to\nSARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense.

We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. METHODS:\nAll patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital).\nThis analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18-86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT).\nWe analyzed the clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics, pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In addition, after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days),\nfollow-up chest CT images were evaluated to assess radiological evolution. FINDINGS: The majority of infected patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly presented\nwith fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all\nincluded patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%), adjacent pleura thickening\nin 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55 (61%).

In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in\n21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3-4 days. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patient's history, clinical\nmanifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests.

In the last twenty years, several viral epidemics such as\nthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first\nidentified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area\nin China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019. Published literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the\nbeginning of December 2019. As they were unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases were classified as \"pneumonia of unknown etiology.\" The Chinese Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation program. The etiology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family. On\nFebruary 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a \"COVID-19,\" which is the acronym of \"coronavirus disease 2019\".\nIn the past twenty years, two additional coronavirus epidemics have occurred. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800\ndeaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases. This new virus seems to be very\ncontagious and has quickly spread globally. In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health\nEmergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission. An additional landmark occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case\nof the disease, not imported from China, was recorded in the United States. Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV. Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on\nTaxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs). The CoVs have become the major pathogens\nof emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. They are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species.[1] For reasons yet to be explained, these\nviruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. Interestingly, these latter viruses have\nprobably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts - the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV - before jumping to humans. The\ndynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it also has an animal origin. The potential for these viruses to grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems\nto be a serious public health risk. Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the \"very high\" level, on February 28, 2020. Probably, the effects\nof the epidemic caused by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving. On March 11, as the number of COVID-19 cases outside China has\nincreased 13 times and the number of countries involved has tripled with more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. World\ngovernments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating effects. Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat.\nAt the same time, scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly\ndeveloping. Many uncertainties remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its peak.\nAt the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community is our best weapon. Aggressive isolation measures\nin China have led to a progressive reduction of cases in the last few days.

Whether this strategy will achieve control\ndepends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from\nimported cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation\nof cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the\ndelay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation\nprevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks\nusing isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. FINDINGS: Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an\nR0 of 1.5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of\ninitial cases, when R0 was 2.5 or 3.5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5\nwere controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2.5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and\nfor an R0 of 3.5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak\nwas controllable when R0 was 1.5. For R0 values of 2.5 or 3.5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than\n1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months.\nThe probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to\nreflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

The conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could, in theory, classify novel virus species into their subspecies. Only 253 upstream noncoding sequences\nof Sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus.

As of 31 January\n2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\nMETHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and\ndiscussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included\nin the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. RESULTS: Most of the publications were\nwritten using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused\non causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to\na seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks,\nhand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective;\nhence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early\nperiod, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the\ncurrent public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32183901", "Tag": "COVID Case Control Epidemiology Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32100877", "Title": "Composition and divergence of coronavirus spike proteins and host ACE2 receptors predict potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.", "JournalName": "Journal of medical virology", "Date Added": "20200227", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 26", "Abstract": "From the beginning of 2002 and 2012, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) crossed the species barriers to infect humans, causing thousands of infections\nand hundreds of deaths, respectively.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response\nto the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some\ninsights for the rest of the world. METHODS: To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and\nadapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological\nparameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest\nestimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases.\nWe also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different\nstages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). FINDINGS: Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was\nat the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66-97) and 24% (13-90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to\nsustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and\nrespond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan,\nif maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which\ncould be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We\nretrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0-16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features. FINDINGS:\nFrom Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8.3 [SD 3.5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of\ntransmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients\nhad moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]). Common symptoms on admission\nwere fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]). Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38.5 degrees C or higher, and nine (25%) had a\nbody temperature of 37.5-38.5 degrees C. Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]). Besides\nradiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB. All children received\ninterferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir-ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation. Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days.\nBy Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured. INTERPRETATION: Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates\nthe difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.

It is critical to find new treatments. Objective: To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion\nmay be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 5 critically ill patients\nwith laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 <300; and\nmechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020,\nto March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Exposures: Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with\na SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that\nhad been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes of body temperature, Sequential\nOrgan Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane\noxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all\nhad received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days\n(range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion\n(range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of\ntreatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after\ntransfusion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement\nin their clinical status.

Design, Setting, and Participant: This case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman who\ntested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after\nonset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19. The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course. Exposure: Cardiac involvement with COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures:\nDetection of cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement\non cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Results: An otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. She described fever and dry cough the week before.

Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal\noutcome is scarce. Objective: To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective single-center\ncase series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020. Main Outcomes and\nMeasures: Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels. Result: Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19,\n144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and\ncardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT\nlevels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25\nof 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36\n[54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (beta = 0.530, P < .001) and N-terminal pro-brain\nnatriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (beta = 0.613, P < .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR],\n0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P < .001), while no significant dynamic\nchanges of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P =\n.16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (41 [59.6%] vs\n14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of\n19) and 25.6% (43 of 168). Conclusions and Relevance: Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial\ninjury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury.

Recent Findings: Previous research efforts to develop a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine in the years following the 2003 pandemic have opened the door for\ninvestigators to design vaccine concepts and approaches for the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high degree of genetic similarity and bind to the same host\ncell ACE2 receptor. Based on previous experience with SARS-CoV vaccines, it is expected that all COVID-19 vaccines will require careful safety evaluations for immunopotentiation that could lead to increased infectivity\nor eosinophilic infiltration. Besides this, a COVID-19 vaccine target product profile must address vaccinating at-risk human populations including frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 60, and those with\nunderlying and debilitating chronic conditions. Among the vaccine technologies under evaluation are whole virus vaccines, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. Summary: Each current vaccine strategy has distinct\nadvantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is paramount that multiple strategies be advanced quickly and then evaluated for safety and efficacy.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including\nhigh infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. Methods: We develop a\nSusceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis\nthan other existing epidemic models. Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding\nWuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and\nafter January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate\nof Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after\nFebruary 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines\nto 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is\naround late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected\nin China, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). Note that the estimates are from\na deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty. Conclusions: We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou\nand Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other countries at high risk\nof outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran.

Most coronaviruses infect animals but can\nevolve into strains that cross the species barrier and infect humans. At the present, there is no single specific vaccine or efficient antiviral therapy against COVID-19. Recently, we showed that\nintravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment reduces inflammation of intestinal epithelial cells and eliminates overgrowth of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans in the murine gut. Immunotherapy with IVIg could be\nemployed to neutralize COVID-19. However, the efficacy of IVIg would be better if the immune IgG antibodies were collected from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 in the same city,\nor the surrounding area, in order to increase the chance of neutralizing the virus.

Confirmed modes of viral transmission are primarily but not exclusively contact with\ncontaminated environmental surfaces and aerosolization. Evidence-based improvement strategies for attenuation of residual environmental contamination involve a combination of deep cleaning with surface disinfectants and ultraviolet light (UV-C). (1) Place alcohol-based\nhand rubs on the IV pole to the left of the provider. Double glove during induction. (2) Place a wire basket lined with a zip closure plastic bag, on the\nIV pole to the right of the provider. Place all contaminated instruments in the bag (i.e. laryngoscope blades and handles) and close. Designate and maintain clean and dirty areas. After\ninduction of anesthesia, wipe down all equipment and surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol. Use a top down cleaning sequence adequate to reduce bioburden.\nTreat operating rooms using UV-C. (3) Decolonize patients using pre-procedural chlorhexidine wipes, 2 doses of nasal povidone iodine within one hour of incision, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse. (4) Create a\nclosed lumen IV system and use hub disinfection. (5) Provide data feedback by surveillance of ESKAPE transmission. (6) To reduce the use of surgical masks and to reduce potential COVID-19\nexposure, use relatively long (e.g., 12-hour) staff shifts. If there are 8 essential cases to be done (each lasting 1-2 hours), the ideal solution is to have 2 teams complete\nthe 8 cases, not 8 first case starts. (7) Do 1 case in each operating room daily, with terminal cleaning after each case including UV-C or equivalent. (8) Do not\nhave patients go into a large, pooled phase I post-anesthesia care unit, because of the risk of contaminating facility at large along with many staff. Instead, have most patients recover\nin the room where they had surgery, like done routinely in Japan. These 8 programmatic recommendations stand on a substantial body of empirical evidence characterizing the epidemiology of perioperative transmission\nand infection development made possible by support from the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF).", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217947", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32217900", "Title": "High-Resolution Computed Tomography Manifestations of 5 Pediatric Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus.", "JournalName": "Journal of computer assisted tomography", "Date Added": "20200329", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 25", "Abstract": "We present clinical and chest computed tomography (CT) features of 5 cases of pediatric patients with 2019 novel coronavirus.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunologic characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and\n4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the Guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.\nRESULTS: The median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue. Compared to moderate cases, severe cases more\nfrequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and\nTNF-alpha.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Among a cohort of\n799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics and laboratory\nfindings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms. RESULTS: The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex\nwas more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16\n(14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the\ninformation about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the Internet. METHODS: On 2020-02-29 we performed a Google search with the terms \"Prevention coronavirus\", \"Prevention COVID-19\", \"Prevencion coronavirus\", and\n\"Prevencion COVID-19\". A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, and country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health\nOrganization. RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the USA and Spain (72.5%), by digital media and official public health organizations (75.1%). The most\nmentioned WHO preventive measure was \"wash your hands frequently\" (81.3%). Less frequent recommendation was related to \"stay home if you feel unwell\" (32.5%). The analysis by type of author (official\npublic health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask if you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (OR\n= 4.39).

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of\nthousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation,\noxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nand often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel\npermeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Notably, melatonin has a high safety profile. There is significant\ndata showing that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients.

A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations\nand communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over\n7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic\nimpact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the\noutcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy\nincrease susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias towards T-helper 2\n(Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach\nto pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with\nreal-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission and maternal-fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use\nof chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery are addressed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID-19\npatients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively. Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows\non chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) in patients. RESULTS: Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows\nin 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central\nzone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the\nconsolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%). The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%). CT results showed a negative\ncorrelation with SPO2 and lymphocyte numbers (p<0.05), with r-values of -0.446 and -0.780, respectively.

The emergence of\nthis new coronavirus increases the importance of understanding SADS-CoV as well as antivirals. Coronaviral proteases, including main proteases and papain-like proteases (PLP), are attractive antiviral targets because of their essential\nroles in polyprotein processing and thus virus maturation. Here, we describe the biochemical and structural identification of recombinant SADS papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain of nsp3. The SADS-CoV PLP2 was\nshown to cleave nsp1 proteins and also peptides mimicking the nsp2|nsp3 cleavage site and also had deubiquitinating and deISGynating activity by in vitro assay. The crystal structure adopts an architecture\nresembling that of PLPs from other coronaviruses. We characterize both conserved and unique structural features likely directing the interaction of PLP2 with the substrates, also including the tentative mapping of\nactive site and other essential residues. These results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coronaviral PLPs's catalytic mechanism and for the screening and design of therapeutics to\ncombat infection by SADS coronavirus.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center study on patients with COVID-19 from Jan. 18, 2020 to\nFeb. 7, 2020 in Zhuhai, China. Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with\npositive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). CT visual quantitative evaluation was based on summing up the acute lung inflammatory lesions involving each lobe, which was scored as\n0 (0%), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), or 4 (76-100%), respectively. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores. The consistency of two observers\nwas evaluated. The TSS was compared with the clinical classification. ROC was used to test the diagnosis ability of TSS for severe-critical type. RESULTS: This study included 78 patients, 38\nmales and 40 females. There were 24 mild (30.8%), 46 common (59.0%), and 8 severe-critical (10.2%) cases, respectively. The median TSS of severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than common type\n(p < 0.001). The ICC value of the two observers was 0.976 (95% CI 0.962-0.985). ROC analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of TSS for diagnosing severe-critical type\nwas 0.918. The TSS cutoff of 7.5 had 82.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of clinical mild-type patients with COVID-19 was relatively high; CT was not suitable for\nindependent screening tool. The CT visual quantitative analysis has high consistency and can reflect the clinical classification of COVID-19.

METHODS: Molecular docking on the binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of common laboratory mammals and\nthe receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the golden Syrian hamster is an option. Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed. Serial organ\ntissues and blood were harvested for histopathology, viral load and titre, chemokine/cytokine assay, and neutralising antibody titre. RESULTS: The Syrian hamster could be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2. Maximal clinical signs\nof rapid breathing, weight loss, histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair, airway and intestinal\ninvolvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression, high lung viral load, and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation were observed within the first week of virus challenge. The\nlung virus titre was between 105-107 TCID50/g. Challenged index hamsters consistently infected naive contact hamsters housed within the same cage, resulting in similar pathology but not weight loss. All infected\nhamsters recovered and developed mean serum neutralising antibody titre >/=1:427 fourteen days post-challenge. Immunoprophylaxis with early convalescent serum achieved significant decrease in lung viral load but not in lung pathology.\nNo consistent non-synonymous adaptive mutation of the spike was found in viruses isolated from infected hamsters.

These disorders share underlying pathophysiology related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that may be clinically\ninsightful. In particular, activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is dysregulated in cardiovascular disease, and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to initiate\nthe infection. Cardiovascular disease and pharmacologic RAS inhibition both increase ACE2 levels, which may increase the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 within the lung and heart. Conversely, mechanistic evidence from related coronaviruses\nsuggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may downregulate ACE2, leading to toxic overaccumulation of Angiotensin II that induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and fulminant myocarditis. RAS inhibition could mitigate this effect. With\nconflicting mechanistic evidence, we propose key clinical research priorities necessary to clarify the role of RAS inhibition in COVID-19 mortality that could be rapidly addressed by the international research community.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215613", "Tag": "COVID Mortality"}, {"PMID": "32215598", "Title": "Neonatal Early-Onset Infection With SARS-CoV-2 in 33 Neonates Born to Mothers With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.", "JournalName": "JAMA pediatrics", "Date Added": "20200328", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 26", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215598", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32215590", "Title": "Turbulent Gas Clouds and Respiratory Pathogen Emissions: Potential Implications for Reducing Transmission of COVID-19.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Date Added": "20200328", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 26", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215590", "Tag": "COVID Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32215589", "Title": "Antibodies in Infants Born to Mothers With COVID-19 Pneumonia.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Date Added": "20200328", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 26", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215589", "Tag": "COVID Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32215581", "Title": "Possible Vertical Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 From an Infected Mother to Her Newborn.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Date Added": "20200328", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 26", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215581", "Tag": "COVID Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32215579", "Title": "Can SARS-CoV-2 Infection Be Acquired In Utero?: More Definitive Evidence Is Needed.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Date Added": "20200328", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 26", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215579", "Tag": "COVID Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32215548", "Title": "Are patients with inflammatory bowel disease at increased risk for Covid-19 infection?", "JournalName": "Journal of Crohn's & colitis", "Date Added": "20200328", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 26", "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD)] and ulcerative colitis (UC), the main inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in human beings, are chronic, immune-inflammatory diseases, whose pathogenesis implicates a complex interaction between environmental factors and\ngenetic susceptibility.

COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria\nfor being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO)\nand multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of\nCOVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but\nnot curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or\n(UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in\nan attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ\ndamage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the\navoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients\nwere treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of\ndecreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis\nof coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered\nfor compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded\nUC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis...1. Minimize regulatory burden by all\nagencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance.2. Institute appropriate safeguards to avoid negative consequences from unscrupulous actors.3. With proper informed consent from\npatients or proxy when necessary, and subject to accumulation of data in that cohort, allow the procedure to be initiated in critically ill patients who are not responding to conventional\ntherapies.KEY WORDS: Coronavirus, COVID-19, cytokine storm, multiorgan failure, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214286", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32214232", "Title": "Management of IBD during the COVID-19 outbreak: resetting clinical priorities.", "JournalName": "Nature reviews.

Infectious diseases", "Date Added": "20200328", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 23", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for\npatients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and\nserum antibody responses. METHODS: We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva,\nand rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD)\nwere measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. FINDINGS: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion,\nof whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37-75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5.2 log10 copies per\nmL (IQR 4.1-7.0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope -0.15, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.11; R(2)=0.71). In one\npatient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's rho=0.48, 95% CI 0.074-0.75; p=0.020). For 16 patients with serum samples\navailable 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for\nanti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R(2)>0.9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. INTERPRETATION: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive\nspecimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature\nof this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement\nRT-qPCR for diagnosis.

Infectious diseases", "Date Added": "20200328", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 23", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in\nSingapore. We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful. METHODS: We adapted an influenza epidemic\nsimulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number\nof SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R0] of 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5) and assuming 7.5%\nof infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline\nscenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as\nquarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering\nthe asymptomatic fraction of infections (22.7%, 30.0%, 40.0%, and 50.0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures. FINDINGS: For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1.5, the median\ncumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000-320 000), corresponding to 7.4% (IQR 6.5-8.5) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections\nincreased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000-776 000) when R0 was 2.0, corresponding to 19.3% (17.8-20.6) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000-1\n249 000) when R0 was 2.5, corresponding to 32% (30.9-33.1) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median\nnumber of infections by 99.3% (IQR 92.6-99.9) when R0 was 1.5, by 93.0% (81.5-99.7) when R0 was 2.0, and by 78.2% (59.0 -94.4) when R0 was 2.5. Assuming increasing asymptomatic\nfractions up to 50.0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R0 of 1.5.\nINTERPRETATION: Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of\nSARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because\nat this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the\nneed for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

Descriptive statistical methods, chi(2) test and curve fitting were used to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of the clustered cases. Results: By 25 February, 2020, the data\nof 1 052 cases in 366 epidemic clusters were collected. In these clustered cases, 86.9%(914/1 050) occurred in families. Among the 1 046 cases with gender information, 513 were males\n(49.0%) and 533 were females (51.0%). The cases were mainly young adults between 18 and 59 years old, accounting for 68.5% (711/1 038).

Methods In this study, postmortem examination data from the institute of 61 cases of children whose cause of death were identified as viral pneumonia in recent\nyears were collected. The gender, age, clinical symptoms and pathological features were comparatively analyzed. Results Among the 61 cases of children who died of viral pneumonia, most were within 2\nyears old 83.61%, and a large proportion died within 2 weeks after the onset of the disease 91.80%. General changes in postmortem examination included respiratory mucosal hyperemia, pleural effusion, pulmonary\nswelling, variegated pulmonary pleura and serosa, focal hemorrhage and edema of the cut surface of the lung. A large proportion of children had enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes 83.61%, and 21.31%\nof children had thymic dysplasia. Histopathological changes included pulmonary alveoli and interstitial edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, alveolar epithelial shedding, serous and or fibrous exudation in the alveoli, formation of viral inclusions,\nformation of transparent membranes, infiltration of inflammatory cells that mainly consisted of macrophages and lymphocytes in interstitial substance and alveoli. Viral infections often affected the heart and gastrointestinal tract. Conclusion\nThe clinical symptoms of children with viral pneumonia are difficult to notice, and because their immune system is not fully developed and they have poor autoimmunity, they can easily get\ninto a critical condition and even die. Through analysis of the characteristics of forensic autopsy and histopathological changes, this study could provide reference for pathological diagnosis of viral pneumonia.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32212512", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32212409", "Title": "Considerations for Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic Perspectives from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Emerging Leader Mentorship (SCAI ELM) Members and Graduates.", "JournalName": "Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions", "Date Added": "20200327", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 25", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32212409", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32212392", "Title": "Leukoerythroblastic reaction in a patient with COVID-19 infection.", "JournalName": "American journal of hematology", "Date Added": "20200327", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 25", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32212392", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32212386", "Title": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Geriatrics and Long-term Care: The ABCDs of COVID-19.", "JournalName": "Journal of the American Geriatrics Society", "Date Added": "20200327", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 25", "Abstract": "The pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has global impact unseen since the 1918 worldwide influenza epidemic.

In the operating room, as part of hospital\noutbreak response measures, anesthesiologists are required to have heightened precautions and tailor anesthetic practices to individual patients. In particular, by minimizing the many aerosol-generating procedures performed during general anesthesia, anesthesiologists\ncan reduce exposure to patients' respiratory secretions and the risk of perioperative viral transmission to healthcare workers and other patients. To avoid any airway manipulation, regional anesthesia should be considered\nwhenever surgery is planned for a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patient or any patient who poses an infection risk. Regional anesthesia has benefits of preservation of respiratory function, avoidance of\naerosolization and hence viral transmission. This article explores the practical considerations and recommended measures for performing regional anesthesia in this group of patients, focusing on control measures geared towards ensuring\npatient and staff safety, equipment protection, and infection prevention. By doing so, we hope to address an issue that may have downstream implications in the way we practice infection control\nin anesthesia, with particular relevance to this new era of emerging infectious diseases and novel pathogens.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20-91 years old) who did\nnot receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China. Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4 days) or progressive-stage\ngroup (onset of symptoms within 4-7 days) for analysis. CT characteristics and the distribution, size, and CT score of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were assessed. RESULTS: In our study, the major\ncharacteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 was ground-glass opacity (61.3%), followed by ground-glass opacity with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacities (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%).

Fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhoea, confusion, dyspnoea, and bilateral\ninterstitial pneumonia are the common symptoms. No therapies are available, and the only way to contain the virus spread is to regularly and thoroughly clean oneself hands with an alcohol-based\nhand rub or wash them with soap and water, to maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing, to avoid touching eyes, nose\nand mouth, and to stay home if one feels unwell. No data are available on the risk of COVID-19 and outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Outbreak restrictions can\nimpact on the IBD care.

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7 to 98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening centre and tertiary\ncare hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from January 26 to February 16, 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical,\nlaboratory and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike's information criterion in a stepwise fashion to\nbuild logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristics curves, adjusting for over-confidence using leave-out-one cross validation. RESULTS: The study population\nincluded 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-out-one cross\nvalidation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (Models 1, 2 and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.91, 0.88 and 0.88 respectively. In\ncomparison, Model 4 had an AUC of 0.65. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly ascertainable clinical and laboratory data could identify individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and enable prioritization of PCR-testing and containment\nefforts.

The current study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors and different evolutionary strategies that were genetically adapted by SARS-CoV-2. Our whole-genome\nanalysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendant of Bat SARS/SARS-like CoVs and bats served as a natural reservoir. SARS-CoV-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions\nincluding the envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent. We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive\nadaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase\nand ORF3a. Six recombination regions were spotted in the S gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a\nway from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host.

SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a\nprediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. METHODS: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource\n(2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as\nnegative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used\nto train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, which was used to explore the pattern of human coronavirus.\nRESULTS: The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that well performance was achieved with the use of the GGAP (g = 3) feature. The predictive model achieved the maximum ACC of 98.18%\ncoupled with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9638. Seven clusters for human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) were found. The cluster for SARS-CoV-2 was very\nclose to that for SARS-CoV, which suggests that both of viruses have the same human receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme II). The big gap in the distance curve suggests that the\norigin of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously. The smooth distance curve for SARS-CoV suggests that its close relatives still exist in\nnature and public health is challenged as usual. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal feature (GGAP, g = 3) performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and could be used to explore\nthe evolutionary dynamic in a simple, fast and large-scale manner.

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly. Many of those patients are treated with reninangiotensin system blockers. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a\nsevere and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The present article discusses this concept. ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates\nin blood at very low levels. As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2\nbecause ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and\ndiffers among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs. Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1\nreceptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans. Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.\nIn summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32208987", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32208983", "Title": "All Feet On Deck-The Role of Podiatry During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preventing hospitalizations in an overburdened healthcare system, reducing amputation and death in people with diabetes.", "JournalName": "Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association", "Date Added": "20200327", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 25", "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is driving significant change in the healthcare system and disrupting the best practices for diabetic limb preservation, leaving large numbers of patients without care.

RESULTS: Implement technology now: Minimize face-to-face contact with participants by\nutilizing digital tools, such as shifting to electronic informed consent and digital HIPAA-compliant tools like emailed surveys or telehealth assessments. Assess the psychological and social impact of COVID-19: How are\nparticipants coping? What health or social behaviors have changed? How are they keeping up with current events? What are they doing to stay connected to their families, friends, and communities?\nAre their health care needs being met? Current studies should be adapted immediately to these ends. Mobilize research platforms for patient needs: Leverage our relationships with participants and rapidly deploy\nnovel clinical engagement techniques such as digital tools to intervene remotely to reduce the negative effects of social isolation on our participants. Equip research staff with tangible resources, and provide\ntimely population-specific health information to support patients and healthcare providers. CONCLUSIONS: We have an opportunity to make an impact on our older adult patients now, as this pandemic continues to\nunfold. Above all, clinical researchers need to continue working - to help as many people as possible through the crisis. This article is protected by copyright.

CoV spike (S) protein which is crucial for receptor\nbinding, membrane fusion via conformational changes, internalization of the virus, host tissue tropism and comprises crucial targets for vaccine development, remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, the present study has been planned\nto determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV and\nSARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0\nand validated by N-GlyDE server. Antigenicity was predicted by NetCTL 1.2 and validated by IEDB Analysis Resource server. The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version 1.0 based on\ncryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Our data suggests that 2019-nCoV is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in China is closely related to SARS-CoV, which has only 12.8%\nof difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9% similarity in minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV. Addition of a novel glycosylation sites were observed in 2019-nCoV. In addition, antigenic\nanalysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but some of the epitopes were found to be similar between both the S proteins. In spite of\nthe variation in S protein amino acid composition, we found no significant difference in their structures. Collectively, for the first time our results exhibit the emergence of human 2019-nCoV is\nclosely related to predecessor SARS-CoV and provide the evidence that 2019-nCoV uses various novel glycosylation sites as SARS-CoV and may have a potential to become pandemic owing its antigenic discrepancy.\nFurther, demonstration of novel Cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes may impart opportunities for the development of peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019-nCoV.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32206694", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32206545", "Title": "Public awareness of coronavirus in Al-Jouf region, Saudi Arabia.", "JournalName": "Zeitschrift fur Gesundheitswissenschaften = Journal of public health", "Date Added": "20200325", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 13", "Abstract": "Aim: Since 2012 and to date, outbreak/new cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were always reported in Saudi Arabia.

As of 18\nMarch 2020, a total number of 194909 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of which have been reported in China (3242) and Italy (2505)3.However, as\nthe pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors4. Smoking, to date,\nhas been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with\na plethora of respiratory diseases5. Smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases6. Previous studies have shown that\nsmokers are twice more likely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous MERS-CoV outbreak7,8.Given the\ngap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on COVID-19 that included information on patients\u2019 smoking status to evaluate the association between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes including\nthe severity of the disease, the need for mechanical ventilation, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization and death.The literature search was conducted on 17 March 2020, using two\ndatabases (PubMed, ScienceDirect), with the search terms: [\u2018smoking\u2019 OR \u2018tobacco\u2019 OR \u2018risk factors\u2019 OR \u2018smoker*\u2019] AND [\u2018COVID-19\u2019 OR \u2018COVID 19\u2019 OR \u2018novel coronavirus\u2019 OR \u2018sars cov-2\u2019 OR \u2018sars cov 2\u2019]\nand included studies published in 2019 and 2020. Further inclusion criteria were that the studies were in English and referred to humans. We also searched the reference lists of the\nstudies included. A total of 71 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 66 were excluded after full-text screening, leaving five studies that were included. All of the studies\nwere conducted in China, four in Wuhan and one across provinces in mainland China. The populations in all studies were patients with COVID-19, and the sample size ranged from 41\nto 1099 patients. With regard to the study design, retrospective and prospective methods were used, and the timeframe of all five studies covered the first two months of the COVID-19\npandemic (December 2019, January 2020).Specifically, Zhou et al.9 studied the epidemiological characteristics of 191 individuals infected with COVID-19, without, however, reporting in more detail the mortality risk factors and the\nclinical outcomes of the disease. Among the 191 patients, there were 54 deaths, while 137 survived. Among those that died, 9% were current smokers compared to 4% among those that\nsurvived, with no statistically significant difference between the smoking rates of survivors and non-survivors (p=0.21) with regard to mortality from COVID-19.Similarly, Zhang et al.10 presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients\nwith COVID-19. The results showed that among severe patients (n=58), 3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) among which 0% were current\nsmokers and 3.7% were former smokers , leading to an OR of 2.23; (95% CI: 0.65\u20137.63; p=0.2).Huang et al.11 studied the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among 41 patients. In this\nstudy, none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU (n=13) was a current smoker. In contrast, three patients from the non-ICU group were current smokers, with no\nstatistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (p=0.31), albeit the small sample size of the study.The largest study population of 1099 patients with COVID-19 was provided by Guan\net al.12 from multiple regions of mainland China. Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had severe symptoms, and 926\nhad non-severe symptoms. Among the patients with severe symptoms, 16.9% were current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers, in contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms where 11.8% were current smokers\nand 1.3% were former smokers. Additionally, in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU or died, 25.5% were current smokers and 7.6% were former\nsmokers. In contrast, in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, only 11.8% were current smokers and 1.6% were former smokers. No statistical analysis for evaluating\nthe association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study.Finally, Liu et al.13 found among their population of 78 patients with COVID-19 that\nthe adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking (27.3%) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization (3.0%), with this difference statistically\nsignificant at the p=0.018 level. In their multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58\u201325.00; p= 0.018).We identified five\nstudies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. Notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers\namong patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases12. However, from their published data we can calculate\nthat the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.98\u20132.00) to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU,\nneed mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.43\u20134.04).In conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data,\nand although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.: Table\n1Overview of the five studies included in the systematic reviewTitleSettingPopulationStudy design and time horizonOutcomesSmoking rates by outcomeZhou et al.9 (2020)Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with\nCOVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort studyJinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan, ChinaAll adult inpatients (aged \u226518 years) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (191 patients)Retrospective multicenter cohort study until\n31 January 2020Mortality54 patients died during hospitalisation and 137 were dischargedCurrent smokers: n=11 (6%)Non-survivors: n=5 (9%)Survivors: n=6 (4%)(p=0.20)Current smoker vs non-smokerUnivariate logistic regression(OR=2.23; 95% CI: 0.65\u20137.63; p=0.2)Zhang et al.10(2020)Clinical characteristics\nof 140 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, ChinaNo. 7 Hospital of Wuhan, ChinaAll hospitalised patients clinically diagnosed as \u2018viral pneumonia\u2019 based on their clinical symptoms with typical changes in\nchest radiology (140 patients)Retrospective 16 January to 3 February 2020Disease SeverityNon-severepatients: n=82Severe patients:n=58Disease SeverityFormer smokers: n=7Severe: n=4 (6.9%)Non-severe: n=3 (3.7%) (p= 0.448)Current smokers: n=2Severe: n=2 (3.4%)Non-severe: n=0 (0%)Guan et al.12(2019)Clinical\nCharacteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland ChinaPatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (1099 patients)Retrospective until 29 January 2020Severity and admission to\nan ICU, the use of mechanical ventilation, or deathNon-severe patients: n=926 Severe patients: n=173By severitySevere cases16.9% current smokers5.2% former smokers77.9% never smokersNon-severe cases11.8% current smokers1.3% former smokers86.9% never smokersBy mechanical\nventilation, ICU or deathNeeded mechanical ventilation, ICU or died25.8% current smokers7.6% former smokers66.7% non-smokersNo mechanical ventilation, ICU or death11.8% current smokers1.6% former smokers86.7% never smokersHuang et al.11(2020)Clinical features of patients\ninfected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, ChinaA hospital in Wuhan, ChinaLaboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patients in Wuhan (41 patients)Prospective from 16 December 2019 to 2 January 2020MortalityAs of 22 January 2020,\n28 (68%) of 41 patients were discharged and 6 (15%) patients diedCurrent smokers: n=3ICU care: n=0Non-ICU care: n=3 (11%)Current smokers in ICU care vs non-ICU care patients (p=0.31)Liu et al.13\n(2019)Analysis of factors associated with disease outcomes in hospitalised patients with 2019 novel coronavirus diseaseThree tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, ChinaPatients tested positive for COVID-19 (78 patients)Retrospective multicentre cohort study from\n30 December 2019 to 15 January 2020Disease progression11 patients (14.1%) in the progression group 67 patients (85.9%) in the improvement/stabilization group 2 deathsNegative progression group: 27.3% smokersIn the improvement group:\n3% smokersThe negative progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilisation group (27.3% vs 3.0%)Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the\nhistory of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58\u201325.00; p= 0.018)", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32206052", "Tag": "COVID Epidemiology Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32205937", "Title": "Is A Problem Shared, A Problem Halved?

The goal of this study is to demonstrate the antiviral activity of LH against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and its potential effect in regulating host immune response. METHODS: The\nantiviral activity of LH against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells using CPE and plaque reduction assay. The effect of LH on virion morphology was visualized under transmission electron\nmicroscope. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. RESULTS: LH significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly\nreduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.

While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an\nincreasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to\nnew local disease epicenters. METHODS: We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and\nwithout travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. RESULTS: While COVID-19\ncases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-cohort of countries with higher\nmedical standards. Further analyses demonstrate a significantly lower proportion of reported COVID-19 cases without travel history to China in countries with lower HAQ (HAQ I vs. HAQ II, posthoc p\n< 0.01).

Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly\neffective during Taiwan's 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB's success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB\nproved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection,\na hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes\nexpanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector - the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients exhibiting atypical manifestations or awaiting definitive diagnosis. A second adaptation involves enhancing\nthe checkpoint hand disinfection and gowning up with Personal Protective Equipment deployed in traditional TCB. Under eTCB, checkpoint hand disinfection and donning of face masks are now required of all\nvisitors who seek to enter hospitals. These enhancements ensure that transmissions by droplets, fomites and contact are disrupted both within hospitals and between hospitals and the broader community.

RESULTS: All\n9 children had an epidemiological history, and family clustering was observed for all infected children. Among the 9 children with COVID-19, 5 had no symptoms, 4 had fever, 2 had\ncough, and 1 had rhinorrhea. There were only symptoms of the respiratory system. Laboratory examination showed no reductions in leukocyte or lymphocyte count. Among the 9 children, 6 had an\nincrease in lymphocyte count and 2 had an increase in leukocyte count. CT examination showed that among the 9 children, 8 had pulmonary inflammation located below the pleura or near\nthe interlobar fissure and 3 had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundles. As for the morphology of the lesions, 6 had nodular lesions and 7 had patchy lesions; ground glass\nopacity with consolidation was observed in 6 children, among whom 3 had halo sign, and there was no typical paving stone sign. CONCLUSIONS: Infants and young children with COVID-19 tend\nto have mild clinical symptoms and imaging findings not as typical as those of adults, and therefore, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be made based on imaging findings along with\nepidemiological history and nucleic acid detection.

A considerable\nproportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan,\nChina, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0]\nvs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia\nSeverity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in\nHubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants\nfrom outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline\nhealth care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P\n= .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001).\nConclusions and Relevance: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants\nreported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32202646", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32202641", "Title": "Exercising Heart and Head in Managing Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan.", "JournalName": "JAMA network open", "Date Added": "20200324", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32202641", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32202635", "Title": "Covid-19: Protecting Worker Health.", "JournalName": "Annals of work exposures and health", "Date Added": "20200324", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 23", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32202635", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32202611", "Title": "Social Media and Emergency Preparedness in Response to Novel Coronavirus.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Date Added": "20200324", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 23", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32202611", "Tag": "COVID Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32202608", "Title": "Ethics Committee Reviews of Applications for Research Studies at 1 Hospital in China During the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Epidemic.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Date Added": "20200324", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 23", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32202608", "Tag": "COVID Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32202513", "Title": "Changing the editorial process at JCI and JCI Insight in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "JournalName": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "Date Added": "20200324", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 23", "Abstract": "The editors of JCI and JCI Insight are revisiting our editorial processes in light of the strain that the COVID-19 pandemic places on the worldwide scientific community.

The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder\ndisease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare. Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed\nsevere pneumonia.

The objectives of\nthis study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus has\nalready established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact be mitigated through quarantine of symptomatic patients?\" Methods: :These questions were addressed in the context of India, using simple mathematical\nmodels of infectious disease transmission. While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model\nassumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps. Results: :It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing\nsymptoms. In an optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R00) being 1.5, and asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would reduce the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent.\nIn the pessimistic scenario of R0=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent. Interpretation & conclusions: :Port-of-entry-based entry screening of\ntravellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community. Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient\nto delay the outbreak by weeks or longer. Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden. Model projections are\nsubject to substantial uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural history of infection of this novel virus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases\nof NCP were collected. The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed. The lesions in each lung segment of the patient's chest CT images were characterised.\nLesions were scored according to length and diffusivity. RESULTS: The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea. A total of 1,702 scored lesions\nwere found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients. The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%). Most of the lesions were ground-glass\nopacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area. Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions. Of the 80 cases, 76\npatients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5%) patients had unilateral lung disease, and eight (10%) patients had cord shadow.

Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the\nlung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell\ntypes of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed\nthat ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the\ncandidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known\nreceptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted \"CellPhoneDB\" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across\ndifferent tissues.

METHODS: We used 18 indicators\nfrom the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and\n(5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level\nof national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent\ncapacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at\nlevels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did\nnot have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries\nhad level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104\n(57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries\nvary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an\neffective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity\nbuilding and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control.

This study was conducted to\nprovide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast\nChongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. RESULTS: A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (IQR 36-55), and there was\nno significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12\n[8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest CT scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or\nground glass opacity in the lungs of all of the patients. All of the patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%] (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]),\nand corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination\nof western and Chinese medicine. Compared with the mild cases, the severe cases had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, D-dimer, LDH, PCT, ALB, CRP, and\nAST. CONCLUSION: In this study, the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients were demonstrated. Kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine played an important role in the treatment of the\nviral pneumonia.

Current method of detection involves qPCR-based technique, which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity.\nFalse negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission. We here aim to describe the time\nkinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19. METHODS: The host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 including IgA,\nIgM and IgG response were examined by using an ELISA based assay on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein. Total 208 plasma samples were collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable\ncases (qPCR negative but had typical manifestation). The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort. RESULTS: The median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection were 5 days\n(IQR 3-6), while IgG was detected on 14 days (IQR 10-18) after symptom onset, with a positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7% and 77.9% respectively.

To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we aimed to present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South\nKorea. METHODS: The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model,\nwe estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval. RESULTS: We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95%\nCI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8),\nindicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age.

Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has been spreading quickly and many countries and\nterritories have been affected, with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Influenza virus has been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia.\nIt was found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and influenza virus. 5 out of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with influenza\nvirus infection, with three cases being influenza A and two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19\nas well as influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (5 [100%] patients), Cough (5 [100%] patients), shortness of breath (5 [100%] patients), nasal tampon (3 [60%]\npatients), pharyngalgia (3 [60%] patients), myalgia (2 [40%] patients), fatigue (2 [40%] patients), headache (2 [40%] patients), and expectoration (2 [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to the\nnormal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (4 [80%] patients), and liver function ALT and AST (2 [40%] patients, 2 [40%] patients) and C-reactive protein (4 [80%] patients) were increased\nwhen admitted to hospital. They stayed in hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4+/-7.02), respectively. The main complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n(1 [20%] patients), acute liver injury (3 [60%] patients), and diarrhea (2 [40%] patients). All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir), oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics. Three patients were treated\nwith glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all patients did not need ICU care and were discharged\nfrom hospital without death. In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings,\nimaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only. However, it is worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia\nmay be more prone to appear for those co-infection patients. This article is protected by copyright.

The\nlaboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods\nare fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used\nto obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over\ntime, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasal-pharynx increases. Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\nThese assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196430", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32196426", "Title": "Seasonality of Respiratory Viral Infections.", "JournalName": "Annual review of virology", "Date Added": "20200321", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 20", "Abstract": "The seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases has been widely recognized for thousands of years, as annual epidemics of the common cold and influenza disease hit the human population like\nclockwork in the winter season in temperate regions. Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter\nmonths. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters\nand human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially\ntemperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are\nlinked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections.

METHODS: The patients' demographic information, cancer history, treatment pattern, information about MERS-coronavirus (CoV) infection, history of travel, clinical symptoms, test\nresults, and outcome were collected and analyzed as part of a quality improvement project to improve the care and safety of our patients. Only patients with confirmed infection were included.\nRESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified, with a median age of 66 years (range, 16-88 years), and 12 patients (63%) were males. The most common underlying disease was\nhematologic malignancies (47.4%), followed by colorectal cancer (21%) and lung cancer (15.8%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities (57.9% and 52.6%, respectively). Infection was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal\nswab in all patients. All patients contracted the infection during their hospitalization for other reasons. Sixteen patients (80%) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 13 patients (81%) had acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome, 11 were intubated (68.75%), 9 had acute renal injury (56.25%), and 3 required dialysis (18.75%). Only 3 patients (15.8%) with early-stage cancers survived. Patients with hematologic malignancies\nand advanced solid tumors had a 100% case fatality rate. The majority of the causes of death were due to multi-organ failure and septic shock. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection resulted in\na high case fatality rate in patients with malignancy. Therefore, it is critical to implement effective primary preventive measures to avoid exposure of patients with cancer to the virus.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196389", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32196387", "Title": "Strategies to Inform Allocation of Stockpiled Ventilators to Healthcare Facilities During a Pandemic.", "JournalName": "Health security", "Date Added": "20200321", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 20", "Abstract": "During a severe pandemic, especially one causing respiratory illness, many people may require mechanical ventilation.

These strategies include actions both in the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic stages. As a part of pandemic preparedness, public health officials should identify and query healthcare facilities in their\njurisdiction that currently care for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation to determine existing inventory of these devices and facilities' ability to absorb additional ventilators. Facilities must have sufficient staff,\nspace, equipment, and supplies to utilize allocated ventilators adequately. At the time of an event, jurisdictions will need to verify and update information on facilities' capacity prior to making allocation\ndecisions. Allocation of scarce life-saving resources during a pandemic should consider ethical principles to inform state and local plans for allocation of ventilators. In addition to ethical principles, decisions should\nbe informed by assessment of need, determination of facilities' ability to use additional ventilators, and facilities' capacity to ensure access to ventilators for vulnerable populations (eg, rural, inner city, and\nuninsured and underinsured individuals) or high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to illness.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196387", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32196116", "Title": "Recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in haemodialysis centres.", "JournalName": "Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association", "Date Added": "20200321", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 20", "Abstract": "COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, is a major global human threat that has turned into a pandemic. This novel coronavirus has specifically high morbidity in the elderly\nand in comorbid populations. Uraemic patients on dialysis combine an intrinsic fragility and a very frequent burden of comorbidities with a specific setting in which many patients are repeatedly treated\nin the same area (haemodialysis centres). Moreover, if infected, the intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare\nsystems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high incidence rates must be taken very seriously. The aim\nof the present review of the European Dialysis (EUDIAL) Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis centres of the emerging COVID-19\npandemic. The management of patients on dialysis affected by COVID-19 must be carried out according to strict protocols to minimize the risk for other patients and personnel taking care of\nthese patients.

Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo\ndrug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets\nin the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid\nproteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host interactions\nin the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data\nin human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the \"Complementary Exposure\" pattern: the targets\nof the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network.

This study\naimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19\nepidemic in central China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation. Individual social\ncapital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress\nReaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and\ntwo or more independent variables, using Pearson's correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS Low levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but\nincreased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep.

People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on\nsevere pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included eight severe or critically ill patients\nwith COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory\nfindings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The\nmost common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed\nnormal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8),\nincreased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-gamma (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill patients underwent invasive\nmechanical ventilation. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of severe pediatric patients\nin Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by fever and cough.

METHODS: We\ngathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: As of Feb 15, 2020,\n36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported\namong affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3-6). The serial interval\nbetween transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume\nfrom China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community.

It has been proven that COVID-19 can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens\nsurgical staffs and inpatients. Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide\nthe highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety\nof wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the\nprocedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are\nscheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management. More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected\nor diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must\nbe run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department. (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross\ninfection of COVID-19 to patients and doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal\nobstruction) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed\nCOVID-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, body\nfluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with\nCOVID-19 must be protected by three-level. After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with\nconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial\npressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400\nmg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement,\ndefined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of\n199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference\nfrom standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the\nlopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points\nwere similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio,\n1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was\nstopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials\nin patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women and to provide some initial evidence\nthat can be used for guiding treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with\nCOVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020. A semiquantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate pulmonary involvement and the time course of changes\non chest CT. Symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were tracked. RESULTS. Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries and one vaginal\ndelivery) during the study period, and four patients were still pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the end of the study period. No\ncases of neonatal asphyxia, neonatal death, stillbirth, or abortion were reported. The most common early finding on chest CT was ground-glass opacity (GGO). With disease progression, crazy paving pattern and\nconsolidations were seen on CT. The abnormalities showed absorptive changes at the end of the study period for all patients. The most common onset symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant\nwomen were fever (13/15 patients) and cough (9/15 patients). The most common abnormal laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia (12/15 patients). CT images obtained before and after delivery showed no signs of\npneumonia aggravation after delivery. The four patients who were still pregnant at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had achieved good recovery. CONCLUSION.\nPregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia. All the cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in the pregnant women in our study were\nthe mild type. All the women in this study-some of whom did not receive antiviral drugs-achieved good recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32186894", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32186711", "Title": "Hypothesis: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may increase the risk of severe COVID-19.", "JournalName": "Journal of travel medicine", "Date Added": "20200319", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "Intravenous infusions of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in experimental animals increase the numbers of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the cardiopulmonary circulation.

Methods: Using Baidu Index Platform (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\nas data resources to obtain the search volume (SV) of keywords for symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from 2017 to 2020, in\nHubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in China and the epidemic data. Data of 2020 were compared with the previous three years. Data of Hubei province were compared\nwith confirmed cases. The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and\nthe hysteresis effects were discussed. Results: Compared the data from January 1 to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years, Hubei's SV for\ncough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001). The\nSV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with new confirmed or suspected cases (R(confirmed) = 0.723, R(suspected) = 0.863, all P < 0.001). The results of the distributed\nlag model suggested that the patients who retrieved relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later.\nConclusions: The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. It warns us to pay attention\nto not only the symptoms of lower respiratory tract, but also the gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19. There is a relationship between Internet retrieval behavior and the\nnumber of new confirmed or suspected cases.

The aim of this study was to look for\nthe warning index in severe COVID-19 patients. We investigated forty-three adult patients with COVID-19. The patients were classified into mild group (28 patients) and severe group (15 patients). Comparison of\nthe haematological parameters between the mild and severe groups showed significant differences in IL-6, D-Dimer, GLU, TT, FIB and CRP (P <0.05). The optimal threshold and area under the ROC\ncurve of IL-6 were 24.3 pg/mL and 0.795 respectively, while those of D-Dimer were 0.28 microg/L and 0.750, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of IL-6 combined with\nD-Dimer was 0.840. The specificity of predicting the severity of COVID-19 during IL-6 and D-Dimer tandem testing was up to 93.3%, while the sensitivity of IL-6 and D-Dimer by parallel\ntest in the severe COVID-19 was 96.4%. IL-6 and D-Dimer were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in the adult patients, and their combined detection had the highest\nspecificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 patients, which has important clinical value.

Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease\n(COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laboratory results, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.\nOutcomes of severe patients and nonsevere patients were compared. Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks, and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients, multivariate analysis\nshowed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients. The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was\nlonger than those without platelet peaks (P < .05). The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was older than those without platelet peaks (P < .05). The\npatients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization days.

The newly discovered coronavirus is similar to some beta-coronaviruses found in\nbats, but different from previously known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High sequence identities and similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV was found. In this work, we searched the homologous templates of all\nnonstructural and structural proteins of 2019-nCoV. Among the nonstructural proteins, the leader protein (nsp1), the papain-like protease (nsp3), the nsp4, the 3C-like protease (nsp5), the nsp7, the nsp8, the nsp9,\nthe nsp10, the RNA-directed RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase (nsp13), the guanine-N7 methyltransferase (nsp14), the uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (nsp15), the 2'-O-methyltransferase (nsp16), and the ORF7a protein could be built on the\nbasis of homology templates. Among the structural proteins, the spike protein (S-protein), the envelope protein (E-protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) can be constructed based on the crystal structures of\nthe proteins from SARS-CoV. It is known that PL-Pro, 3CL-Pro, and RdRp are important targets for design antiviral drugs against 2019-nCoV. And S protein is critical target candidate for inhibitor\nscreening or vaccine design against 2019-nCoV because coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of S protein to cell surface receptors. It is believed that these proteins should be useful\nfor further structure-based virtual screening and related computer-aided drug development and vaccine design.

The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS. One\nhundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range, 21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in\n65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein\nlevel was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five\nlobes in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had ground-glass opacity (GGO), and\n44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 patients [52%]).

Consequently, many countries have\nimplemented flight restrictions to China. China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province. However, whether these two enormous measures have\nled to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed available data on the development of confirmed domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after\nlockdown measures. We evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China before and after\nlockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9-2.6), to 4\ndays (95% CI: 3.5-4.3), after imposing lockdown. A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1-26.3), respectively. Moreover, the correlation between domestic air\ntraffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, p < 0.05 vs. after lockdown: r = 0.91, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly decreased growth\nrate and increased doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures.

We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the\nhealth status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of\nthe 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to\nassess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate\npooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020).

In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could\ndifferentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science\nwas performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients\nwith or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included\nin the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31x10(9)/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29x10(9)/L). A subgroup analysis\ncomparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48x10(9)/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39x10(9)/L. In the four studies (n=1427) which reported data on\nrate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6).

Compared with SpO2>/=90% group, patients of the\nSpO2<90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate\nand decrease the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%.

Available information on CT features of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is scattered in different publications, and a cohesive literature review has yet to be compiled. MATERIALS AND\nMETHODS. This article includes a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization database. RESULTS. Known features of COVID-19 on initial CT include bilateral\nmultilobar ground-glass opacification (GGO) with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes and less frequently within the right middle lobe. Atypical initial imaging presentation of consolidative opacities\nsuperimposed on GGO may be found in a smaller number of cases, mainly in the elderly population. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement are some of the less\ncommon findings, mainly in the later stages of the disease. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, CT halo sign, and pneumothorax are uncommon but may be seen with disease progression.\nFollow-up CT in the intermediate stage of disease shows an increase in the number and size of GGOs and progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and\ndevelopment of a crazy paving pattern, with the greatest severity of CT findings visible around day 10 after the symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most common indication\nfor transferring patients with COVID-19 to the ICU and the major cause of death in this patient population. Imaging patterns corresponding to clinical improvement usually occur after week 2 of\nthe disease and include gradual resolution of consolidative opacities and decrease in the number of lesions and involved lobes.

Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this\nstudy was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department\nin Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.\nRESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was\nobserved (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (+/- SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation\ndepartment was 4.40 +/- 2.00 and 5.52 +/- 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and\npatients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results,\nGGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%)\n(p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5\naffected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less\nfrequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or\nconsolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings\nhighly suspicious of COVID-19.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32174128", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32174096", "Title": "[Management strategies for patients with gynecological malignancies during the outbreak of COVID19].", "JournalName": "Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi", "Date Added": "20200317", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "Objective: To explore the management strategies for patients with gynecological malignant tumors during the outbreak and transmission of COVID19.

RESULTS: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert\nconsensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. CONCLUSIONS:\nThere is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.

Methods: Minimally invasive autopsies from lung,\nheart, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, stomach, intestine, thyroid and skin were performed on three patients died of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Chongqing, China. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE)\nand histochemical staining were performed to investigate the pathological changes of indicated organs or tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells as well as the\nexpression of 2019-nCoV proteins. Real time PCR was carried out to detect the RNA of 2019-nCoV. Results: Various damages were observed in the alveolar structure, with minor serous exudation and\nfibrin exudation. Hyaline membrane formation was observed in some alveoli. The infiltrated immune cells in alveoli were majorly macrophages and monocytes. Moderate multinucleated giant cells, minimal lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils\nwere also observed. Most of infiltrated lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Significant proliferation of type II alveolar epithelia and focal desquamation of alveolar epithelia were also indicated. The blood vessels\nof alveolar septum were congested, edematous and widened, with modest infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Hyaline thrombi were found in a minority of microvessels. Focal hemorrhage in lung tissue, organization\nof exudates in some alveolar cavities, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosiswere observed. Part of the bronchial epithelia were exfoliated. Coronavirus particles in bronchial mucosal epithelia and type II alveolar epithelia were\nobserved under electron microscope. Immunohistochemical staining showed that part of the alveolar epithelia and macrophages were positive for 2019-nCoV antigen. Real time PCR analyses identified positive signals for 2019-nCoV nucleic\nacid. Decreased numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed in spleen. Furthermore, degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells, formation of hyaline thrombus in small vessels, and pathological changes\nof chronic diseases were observed in other organs and tissues, while no evidence of coronavirus infection was observed in these organs. Conclusion: s The lungs from novel coronavirus pneumonia patients\nmanifest significant pathological lesions, including the alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation, alveolar epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation.

This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens,\nthe diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport\nand storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination\nand testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated\nassays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic\naccuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper\n(or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage,\ntogether with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32172228", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32172227", "Title": "Laboratory abnormalities in children with novel coronavirus disease 2019.", "JournalName": "Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine", "Date Added": "20200317", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32172227", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32172226", "Title": "Prominent changes in blood coagulation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "JournalName": "Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine", "Date Added": "20200317", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "Background As the number of patients increases, there is a growing understanding of the form of pneumonia sustained by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused an outbreak in\nChina.

When COVI-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause\nmild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6. The binding of COVI-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release\nof pro-IL-1beta which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1beta which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Suppression of pro-inflammatory\nIL-1 family members and IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. Cytokine IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired\nimmune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on IL-18Ralpha receptor. IL-37 performs its immunosuppressive activity by acting on mTOR and increasing the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)\nkinase. This cytokine inhibits class II histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and inflammation in inflammatory diseases by suppressing MyD88 and subsequently IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF and CCL2. The suppression of IL-1beta by\nIL-37 in inflammatory state induced by coronavirus-19 can have a new therapeutic effect previously unknown. Another inhibitory cytokine is IL-38, the newest cytokine of the IL-1 family members, produced by\nseveral immune cells including B cells and macrophages.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of\npatients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. METHODS: In this retrospective,\nmulticentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (>/=18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died\nby Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We\nused univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were\nincluded in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed\nby diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.17,\nper year increase; p=0.0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5.65, 2.61-12.23; p<0.0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/mL (18.42, 2.64-128.55; p=0.0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding\nwas 20.0 days (IQR 17.0-24.0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. INTERPRETATION: The potential\nrisk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding\nprovides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the\ninfection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission\nwith four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for\nsustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. METHODS: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in\nWuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the\nprobability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly\navailable datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by\ndate of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1,\n2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan\n29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries\nwith high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between\nJan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2.35 (95% CI 1.15-4.77) 1 week before travel restrictions\nwere introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1.05 (0.41-2.39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential\nto Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. INTERPRETATION: Our\nresults show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar\ntransmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

Considering its high specificity but low sensitivity, a modified Grunow-Finke\ntool (mGFT) has been developed with improved sensitivity. The mGFT has been validated against some past disease outbreaks, but it has not been applied to ongoing outbreaks. This study is\naimed to score the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia using both the original GFT and mGFT. The publicly available data on human cases of\nMERS-CoV infections reported in Saudi Arabia (2012-2018) were sourced from the FluTrackers, World Health Organization, Saudi Ministry of Health, and published literature associated with MERS outbreaks investigations. The risk assessment\nof MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia was analyzed using the original GFT and mGFT criteria, algorithms, and thresholds. The scoring points for each criterion were determined by three researchers to minimize\nthe subjectivity. The results showed 40 points of total possible 54 points using the original GFT (likelihood: 74%), and 40 points of a total possible 60 points (likelihood: 67%) using\nthe mGFT, both tools indicating a high likelihood that human MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia is unnatural in origin. The findings simply flag unusual patterns in this outbreak, but do not\nprove unnatural etiology. Proof of bioattacks can only be obtained by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force\nfor host cell recognition. METHODS: In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and\nstructural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. RESULTS: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have\nsequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain beta\n(SBDbeta). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDbeta of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. CONCLUSIONS: We\nreveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78.

Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19\npneumonia have not yet been well delineated. Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died. Design,\nSetting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020.

Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data\nwere also collected and analyzed. Results: Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS,\nand of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention\nof influenza by collecting randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMbase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to January 27, 2020 to identify relevant systematic reviews. The\nRCTs included in systematic reviews were identified. Then we searched the latest published RCTs from the above three databases and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished RCTs. Two reviewers independently extracted the\ndata and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate pooled estimates by using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of six RCTs involving 9 171 participants were included.\nThere were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.92-1.28, P > .05), laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.70-1.11), laboratory-confirmed\nrespiratory infection (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.29) and influenzalike illness (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.14) using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95\nrespirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). CONCLUSION: The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed\ninfluenza. It suggests that N95 respirators should not be recommended for general public and nonhigh-risk medical staff those are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167245", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32167181", "Title": "Initial clinical features of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 in two emergency departments outside of Hubei, China.", "JournalName": "Journal of medical virology", "Date Added": "20200314", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 13", "Abstract": "With an increasing number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases outside of Hubei, emergency departments (EDs) and fever clinics are facing challenges posed by the large number of admissions of\npatients suspected to have COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. The polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) remains unstudied thoroughly since it is similar\nto other sarbecoviruses. In this short communication, we performed phylogenetic-structural sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis showed that the viral pp1ab has not changed in most isolates\nthroughout the outbreak time, but interestingly a deletion of 8 aa in the virulence factor nonstructural protein 1 was found in a virus isolated from a Japanese patient that did\nnot display critical symptoms.

However, 5,298 more patient were confirmed until 4-Mar. The\npurpose is to estimate and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures using mathematical modeling. Methods: Deterministic mathematical model(SEIHR) has been established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of confirmed\npatients in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province(Daegu/NGP), the main area of outbreak, were used. The first patient's symptom onset date was assumed on 22-Jan. We estimate the reproduction number(R), and\nthe effect of preventive measures, assuming that the effect has been shown from 29-Feb. or 5-Mar. Results: The estimated R in Hubei Province was 4.2655, while the estimated initial R\nin Korea was 0.5555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.4721 and 3.5428. When the transmission period decreases from 4 days to 2 days, the outbreak finished early,\nbut the peak of the epidemic has increased, and the total number of patients has not changed much. If transmission rate decreases about 90% or 99%, the outbreak finished early,\nand the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreased.

In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the\ndifferences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses.\nMETHODS: The genome composition, nucleotide analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage, and effective number of codons (ENc) were analyzed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E),\nmembrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important nonstructural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS,\nand SARS CoVs. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with\nG or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5 to 20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression\nefficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over-biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS,\nand MERS CoV.

Methods: In this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus epidemic in China with\ncumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months. The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population assumption. This model was built with the data and used\nto assess the detection rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true infections, detectable and detected cases. Results: Results from the second derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus\nepidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indicated by results from both\nsecond derivative and exponential modeling analyses. The epidemic started to decelerate immediately after the massive actions. The results derived from our analysis signaled the decline of the epidemic 14 days\nbefore it eventually occurred on February 4, 2020.

Take epidemiological history, fever, and the blood lymphocytes decline as clinical indicators, used CT to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement. According to the current\nnational standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xiangya process was constructed according to\nmulti-index, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and national standards, the efficiency of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the test and verification library. Results: A continuous cohort of 382\nadults who screened COVID-19 was included in which 261 cases were in the test library and 121 cases were in the verification library. In the 382 cases, 192 were males\n(50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years).

More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcgammaR-mediated effector systems to varying degrees.\nThis is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralise or remove small macromolecules\nsuch as cytokines or other immunoglobulins. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a \"scaffolding\" role for FcgammaR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action\nsuch as immune agonism or may trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as SARS-CoV-2, requires increased effort on\nthe development of improved and novel mAbs.

Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification\nevents. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19\noutbreak. METHODS: 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR\n(qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. RESULTS: The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens.\nMale and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender,\nwas the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies\nto reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of\npsychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020,\nwe conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and\nconcerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status\nwas assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact\nof the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most\nrespondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female\ngender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of\nstress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated\nwith a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China,\nmore than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.

Purpose To assess the performance of\nUnited States (U.S.) and Chinese radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT. Methods A total of 219 patients with both positive COVID-19 by RT-PCR and abnormal chest\nCT findings were retrospectively identified from 7 Chinese hospitals in Hunan Providence, China from January 6 to February 20, 2020. A total of 205 patients with positive Respiratory Pathogen Panel\nfor viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia by original radiology interpretation within 7 days of each other were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in\nProvidence, RI. Three Chinese radiologists blindly reviewed all chest CTs (n=424) to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia. A sample of 58 age-matched cases was randomly selected and evaluated by 4\nU.S. radiologists in a similar fashion. Different CT features were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results For all chest CTs, three Chinese radiologists correctly differentiated COVID-19 from non-COVID-19\npneumonia 83% (350/424), 80% (338/424), and 60% (255/424) of the time, respectively.

Methods: The general conditions, biochemical\nindicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital\nwere retrospectively analyzed. The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared. The mean\nof two samples in univariate analysis was compared by t-test and analysis of variance. The counting data was measured by chi(2) tests. The non-normal distribution measurement data were described by\nthe median, and the non-parametric test was used.

The\nprevious epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization\nof compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for\ntreating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. In addition, a combination of the human\nimmunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-INFb) were shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-INFb also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and\nmice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-INFb against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mice model. The relatively high mortality\nrates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, has suggested that pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains unknown whether the\ngenerated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections.

Limited data are available for pregnant women\nwith COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, and\nchest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n[SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the\npresence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation. FINDINGS: All nine patients\nhad a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two),\nand malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1.0 x 10(9) cells per L). Three patients had increased\naminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All\nnine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were\ntested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus. INTERPRETATION: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients\nwho developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19\npneumonia in late pregnancy.

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features,\nincluding the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of\nCOVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from\n50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible\nexposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation\nperiod was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6\ndays) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or\nquarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median\nincubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2,\nalthough longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares\nthe same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect\nof hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of\nhydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by\nintegrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the\ndrug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 muM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 muM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg\ntwice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three\ntimes the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.

How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is\nthe only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with\nmouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer,\nwhere three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed\nthat after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a\nnew role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike\nand hence the fusion of viral and host membranes.

The virus has\nsince rapidly spread to all provinces and autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract\nsymptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected\npatients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol\n48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days)\nor a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4\nconsecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of\nhospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the\nthird serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past.\nHowever, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other\ntypes of severe respiratory disease.

However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those without\nsuch facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS:\nA 2019-nCoV related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing\nof ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit\ncytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified\nby quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and\nuses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 mumol/L. CEP\ndemonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 mumol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 mumol/L\nCEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 +/- 0.02] x 10vs. 1.00 +/- 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque\nassays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 mumol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00\n+/- 0.37 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.12, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 +/- 0.43 vs. [6.18 +/- 0.95] x 10, t = 3.98, P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research.

Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study\naims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were\nconducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic\ncarriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As\na result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases\nshowed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during\nhospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined\nas the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24\nasymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts\nwere prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness.

Methods: A retrospective comparison of the pregnancy outcomes was done between 16 women with\nCOVID-19 and 45 women without COVID-19. Also, the results of laboratory tests, imaging examinations, and the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were performed in 10 cases of neonatal deliverd from women\nwith COVID-19. Results: (1) Of the 16 pregnant women with COVID-19, 15 cases were ordinary type and 1 case was severe type. No one has progressed to critical pneumonia. The\ndelivery method of the two groups was cesarean section, and the gestational age were (38.7+/-1.4) and (37.9+/-1.6) weeks, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P> 0.05). Also,\nthere wee no significant differences in the intraoperative blood loss and birth weight of the newborn between the two groups (all P>0.05). (2) Ten cases of neonates delivered from pregnant\nwomen with COVID-19 were collected. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were all negative. There were no significant differences in fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, preterm birth, and neonatal asphyxia between\nthe two groups (all P>0.05). (3) In the treatment of uterine contraction fatigue, carbetocin or carboprost tromethamine was used more in cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 (1.3+/-0.6), compared\nwith Non-COVID-19 group (0.5+/-0.7), the difference was statistically significant (P=0.001). Conclusions: If there is an indication for obstetric surgery or critical illness of COVID-19 in pregnant women, timely termination of\npregnancy will not increase the risk of premature birth and asphyxia of the newborn, but it is beneficial to the treatment and rehabilitation of maternal pneumonia.

METHODS: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases\n(infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a\nsubset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.\nRESULTS: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the\nmost certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). CONCLUSIONS: The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median\nincubation period.

This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those\nwith an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012. While human\nstrains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is\ncurrently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as\npotential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including\nsealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the\ndamage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition\nand earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine\nstrategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges.

DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. SETTING: Nationwide general population in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over)\nfrom the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3)\ntrust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. RESULTS: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions\ndecreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR)\n1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk\nperception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95 CI 1.44 to\n4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during\nMERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions.

We\naimed to quantify severity of COVID-19 infection on High-Resolution CT and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020, the\nclinical, laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days\nfrom the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation\nand linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five (83%) patients exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial\nthickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms, compared to initial CT (all p<0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications\n(R=0.68, p<0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range 0.36-0.75, p<0.05). The highest\ntemperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (p=0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented\nwith typical ground-grass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements.

American journal of roentgenology", "Date Added": "20200307", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 5", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS\nAND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT\nsigns of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square\ntest was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [+/- SD] age, 52.8\n+/- 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who\nhad their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level.\nMultiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score\nfor the upper zone (3.0 +/- 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 +/- 3.8) and lower (4.5 +/- 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p =\n0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area\n(4.4 +/- 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 +/- 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had\nground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural\nline; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms\nof pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (</= 7\ndays after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic\nstreaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\nshowed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT\nsigns of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A\ndecreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32134681", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32134205", "Title": "Clinical and CT features in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection: Different points from adults.", "JournalName": "Pediatric pulmonology", "Date Added": "20200307", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 5", "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To discuss the different characteristics of clinical, laboratory, and chest computed tomography (CT) in pediatric patients from adults with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: The clinical, laboratory, and\nchest CT features of 20 pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were retrospectively analyzed during 23 January and 8 February 2020. The clinical\nand laboratory information was obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our hospital. RESULTS: Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close\ncontact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20, 60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to,\nwhich is not common in adults.

COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46%\nby far based on published data from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0-24 days. The\nbasic reproductive number (R0 ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2-3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China\nCDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing\nthe spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. 3019 health workers were infected by Feb 12, 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely\nburdened the health system, especially in Wuhan.

Methods: In this observational study, airway secretions from children (n=104) with CF presenting with pulmonary exacerbations were collected and tested for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria and viral pathogens using\nappropriate laboratory techniques. The frequencies of isolation of various organisms were calculated and associated with various demographic profiles. Results: Bacteria were isolated in 37 (35.5%) and viral RNA in 27\n(29.3%) children.

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated\nR 0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation\nis needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R t .\nIn the first assumption, R t was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R\nt = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R t was assumed to\ngradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R t = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R t = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented\npublic health intervention.

The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and\nmanagement of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This\nstudy included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with\nadenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included\nimages from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT\npatterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly\ndiagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation\nwith or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The \"reversed halo\" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign\nare uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19\ncompared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful\nas a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients.

METHODS: We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight SARS-CoV-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 20 healthy\ncontrols. RESULTS: The median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was\nsimilar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). However, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved\nin the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants\nin a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. The microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated\nlevels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility.

Therapeutics that\nmay assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on\nviral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative\nsuggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing\nthe aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the\nstrain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic.

The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and\nthe clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed\nimaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years\nold accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients\nwith COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction\nbronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%])\nand multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the\nseverity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation\nof the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to\nhave peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal.

(4) Accompanying signs: 100 cases (76.9%) with vascular thickening, 98 cases (75.3%) with \"pleural parallel sign\" ; \"intralobular\nseptal thickening\" in 100 cases (76.9%); \"halo sign\" in 13 cases (10%); \"reversed-halo sign\" in 6 cases (4.6%); pleural effusion in 3 cases (2.3 %), and pneumatocele in 2 cases\n(1.5%); no case with pulmonary cavity. Among 35 patients that underwent follow-up CT, 21 patients (60%) improved while 14 (40%) exacerbated. Conclusions: COVID-19 imaging characteristic mainly has subpleural, centrilobular and\ndiffused distribution. The first two distributions can overlap or progress to diffused distribution. In the later period, it was mainly manifested as organizing pneumonia and fibrosis. The most valuable characteristic\nis the pleural parallel sign.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125131", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32125130", "Title": "[Individualized treatment recommendations for lung cancer patients at different stages of treatment during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease epidemic].", "JournalName": "Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 3", "Abstract": "In order to achieve the overall victory of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease epidemic in this 'war', especially to prevent the disease recurrence from rebounding during the resumption of labor,\nthe government has not loosened any control of personnel mobility, which has obviously affected the normal examination and treatment of lung cancer patients under the influence of this epidemic.

The purpose of this article is to share our local experience of stepping up infection control measures in\nophthalmology to minimise COVID-19 infection of both healthcare workers and patients. METHODS: Infection control measures implemented in our ophthalmology clinic are discussed. The measures are based on detailed risk assessment\nby both local ophthalmologists and infection control experts. RESULTS: A three-level hierarchy of control measures was adopted. First, for administrative control, in order to lower patient attendance, text messages with\nan enquiry phone number were sent to patients to reschedule appointments or arrange drug refill. In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage system was set up to identify\npatients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute conjunctivitis or recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these individuals to postpone their appointments for at least 14 days. Micro-aerosol generating procedures,\nsuch as non-contact tonometry and operations under general anaesthesia were avoided. Nasal endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing and cause generation of droplets. All elective clinical services were\nsuspended. Infection control training was provided to all clinical staff. Second, for environmental control, to reduce droplet transmission of COVID-19, installation of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent disinfection of\nequipment, and provision of eye protection to staff were implemented. All staff were advised to measure their own body temperatures before work and promptly report any symptoms of upper respiratory\ntract infection, vomiting or diarrhoea. Third, universal masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were promoted. CONCLUSION: We hope our initial experience in stepping up infection\ncontrol measures for COVID-19 infection in ophthalmology can help ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential community outbreak or pandemic. In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, ophthalmologists should work\nclosely with local infection control teams to implement infection control measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32124000", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32123994", "Title": "Critical care crisis and some recommendations during the COVID-19 epidemic in China.", "JournalName": "Intensive care medicine", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123994", "Tag": "COVID Epidemiology Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32123993", "Title": "Clinical features and short-term outcomes of 18 patients with corona virus disease 2019 in intensive care unit.", "JournalName": "Intensive care medicine", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123993", "Tag": "COVID Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32123989", "Title": "The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections in China: prevention, control and challenges.", "JournalName": "Intensive care medicine", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123989", "Tag": "COVID Case Control Treatment Default"}, {"PMID": "32123986", "Title": "Imaging changes of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in advanced stage.", "JournalName": "Intensive care medicine", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123986", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32123347", "Title": "The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2.", "JournalName": "Nature microbiology", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123347", "Tag": "COVID Default"}, {"PMID": "32122881", "Title": "Covid-19: retired doctors could be asked to return to work, says Hancock.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122881", "Tag": "COVID Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32122876", "Title": "Covid-19: a digital epidemic.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122876", "Tag": "COVID Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32122875", "Title": "Covid-19: US health department staff sent to meet citizens returning from China weren't protected, claims whistleblower.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122875", "Tag": "COVID Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32122812", "Title": "Traditional Chinese medicine is a resource for drug discovery against 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).", "JournalName": "Journal of integrative medicine", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122812", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32122636", "Title": "Guide to Understanding the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.", "JournalName": "Mayo Clinic proceedings", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 28", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122636", "Tag": "COVID Epidemiology Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32122469", "Title": "Anti-Chinese sentiment during the 2019-nCoV outbreak.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 29", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122469", "Tag": "COVID Big Five Epidemiology"}, {"PMID": "32122468", "Title": "On the use of corticosteroids for 2019-nCoV pneumonia.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 29", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122468", "Tag": "COVID Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32122430", "Title": "Identification of COVID-19 Can be Quicker through Artificial Intelligence framework using a Mobile Phone-Based Survey in the Populations when Cities/Towns Are Under Quarantine.", "JournalName": "Infection control and hospital epidemiology", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 3", "Abstract": "We are proposing to use machine learning algorithms to be able to improve possible case identifications of COVID-19 more quicker when we use a mobile phone-based web survey.

The observation indicators included total blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial blood gas\nanalysis, myocardial injury markers, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolyte, procalcitonin (PCT), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood lipid, pulmonary CT and pathogen detection. Results: Compared with the general group,\nthe lymphocyte count (0.74x10(9) (0.34x10(9), 0.94x10(9))/L vs. 0.99x10(9) (0.71x10(9), 1.29x10(9))/L, P=0.03) was extremely lower in the critical group, CRP (106.98 (81.57, 135.76) mg/L vs. 34.34 (9.55,76.54) mg/L, P<0.001) and PCT\n(0.20 (0.15,0.48) mug/L vs. 0.11 (0.06,0.20)mug/L, P<0.001) were significantly higher in the critical group.

Five million people emigrated from Wuhan\nbefore lockdown, potentially representing a source of virus infection. Determining case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early stage of the epidemic is of great\nimportance for early warning and for the prevention of future outbreaks. METHODS: The official case report on the COVID-19 epidemic was collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location\ninformation on COVID-19 cases was extracted and analyzed using ArcGIS and WinBUGS software. Data on population migration from Wuhan city and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi, and their\ncorrelation with the number of cases was analyzed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in Hubei province accounted for 59.91% (5806/9692) and 95.77% (204/213) of the total cases in\nChina respectively. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan, which are adjacent to Hubei. The time risk of Hubei province on the following day was 1.960 times that on the\nprevious day. The number of cases in some cities was relatively low, but the time risk appeared to be continuously rising. The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases\nand emigration from Wuhan was up to 0.943. The lockdown of 17 cities in Hubei province and the implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented an exponential growth in the\nnumber of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The population that emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source in other cities and provinces. Some cities with a low number of cases showed a\nrapid increase in case load. Owing to the upcoming Spring Festival return wave, understanding the risk trends in different regions is crucial to ensure preparedness at both the individual and\norganization levels and to prevent new outbreaks.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118644", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32118643", "Title": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in 2019 novel coronavirus disease: indications, timing, and implementation.", "JournalName": "Chinese medical journal", "Date Added": "20200303", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 28", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118643", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32118642", "Title": "Science in the fight against the novel coronavirus disease.", "JournalName": "Chinese medical journal", "Date Added": "20200303", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 28", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118642", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32118641", "Title": "From SARS-CoV to 2019-nCoV Outbreak: Similarities in the Early Epidemics and Prediction of Future Trends.", "JournalName": "Chinese medical journal", "Date Added": "20200303", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 28", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118641", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32118640", "Title": "Analysis of factors associated with disease outcomes in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease.", "JournalName": "Chinese medical journal", "Date Added": "20200303", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 28", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the\nprogression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for\nthe COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual\ndata, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an\nimprovement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed\nto explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after\nhospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group\n(66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than\nthe improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, chi = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at\nadmission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4] degrees C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the\nproportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, chi = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P\n= 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3,\n64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 +/- 6.60 vs. 41.27\n+/- 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (chi = 16.01,\nP = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; P\n= 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI:\n1.098-50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224-34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors that led to the progression of\nCOVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature on admission, respiratory failure, albumin, C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of\nmanagement of COVID-19 pneumonia.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118640", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32118639", "Title": "Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients.", "JournalName": "Chinese medical journal", "Date Added": "20200303", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 28", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of\npatients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19,\nproviding further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January\n20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\nConvalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects\nof cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after\ntreatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients'\ninflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days.\nBy February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a\nmedian duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs,\nwith a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present\nin three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed\nthat the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection\nfrom oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P\n= 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11\ndays, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative\nresults (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral\nRNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild\ndisease.

Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately,\nthe outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection,\ndespite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on\nthe necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide\nstrategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant\nto any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\n(ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting\nimmunity. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate\nuse, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32117569", "Tag": "COVID Case Control Epidemiology Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32117225", "Title": "Novel Insights Into Immune Systems of Bats.", "JournalName": "Frontiers in immunology", "Date Added": "20200303", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "In recent years, viruses similar to those that cause serious disease in humans and other mammals have been detected in apparently healthy bats.

METHODS: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature\nsearch for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the\nTraditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a\ndocking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing\nthe selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was\nused to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. RESULTS: Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have\npotential anti-2019-nCoV activity.

METHODS: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service\nto the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between\nsevere and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. FINDINGS: By Feb 10, 2020,\n262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46\n(17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively.

Exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) has been consistently considered the main source of primary human infection. Although Saudi\nArabia reports the highest rate of human MERS-CoV infection and has one of the largest populations of dromedary camels worldwide, their spatial association has not yet been investigated. Thus, this\nstudy aimed to examine the correlation between the spatial distribution of primary MERS-CoV cases with or without a history of camel exposure reported between 2012 and 2019 and dromedary camels\nat the provincial level in Saudi Arabia. In most provinces, a high proportion of older men develop infections after exposure to camels. Primary human infections during spring and winter were\nhighest in provinces characterized by seasonal breeding and calving, increased camel mobilization and camel-human interactions. A strong and significant association was found between the total number of dromedary camels and\nthe numbers of primary camel-exposed and non-exposed MERS-CoV cases. Furthermore, spatial correlations between MERS-CoV cases and camel sex, age and dairy status were significant. Via a cluster analysis, we identified\nRiyadh, Makkah and Eastern provinces as having the most primary MERS-CoV cases and the highest number of camels. Transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans occurs in most primary cases,\nbut there is still a high proportion of primary infections with an ambiguous link to camels. The results from this study include significant correlations between primary MERS-CoV cases and camel\npopulations in all provinces, regardless of camel exposure history. This supports the hypothesis of the role of an asymptomatic human carrier or, less likely, an unknown animal host that has\ndirect contact with both infected camels and humans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the\nimaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled,\nincluding mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5\nyears) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate\nfever (<39.1 degrees C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine\nmild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22,\nright lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible\nextension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary\npresentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which\nwill be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved.

On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was\nreported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25 January. By 4 February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine\nof non-ill passengers were implemented. By 20 February, 619 of 3,700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive. METHODS: We estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of\nthe outbreak using (SEIR) models. We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a\nmodel stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship.\nRESULTS: The basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the ${R}_0$ in the epicentre in Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled\ninitial ${R}_0$ of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected.\nIsolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with\n76 infected persons in their incubation time. CONCLUSIONS: The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more than 2000 additional cases compared\nto no interventions.

These measures require\nthe identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission.\nAlthough these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to\nbetter prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to\nguide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating\nefforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners. Interim guidance is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will\nrapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and communities.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32106216", "Tag": "COVID Epidemiology Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32105641", "Title": "COVID-19 pneumonia: what has CT taught us?", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

We aimed\nto describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two\nhospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan:\ngroup 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done </=1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks\nto 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. FINDINGS: 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020,\nwere retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49.5 years (SD 11.0). The mean number of involved lung segments was\n10.5 (SD 6.4) overall, 2.8 (3.3) in group 1, 11.1 (5.4) in group 2, 13.0 (5.7) in group 3, and 12.1 (5.9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality\nobserved was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In\ngroup 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity\npredominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in\ngroup 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even\nin asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with\nclinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection\nis scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill\nadult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic\ndata, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020.\nSecondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. FINDINGS: Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult\npatients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59.7 (SD 13.3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61.5%)\npatients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors,\nnon-survivors were older (64.6 years [11.2] vs 51.9 years [12.9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30\n[94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with\ncardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13.5%) patients. INTERPRETATION: The mortality of critically\nill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and\nARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\nFUNDING: None.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105632", "Tag": "COVID Big Five Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32105614", "Title": "Chinese medical staff request international medical assistance in fighting against COVID-19.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become\nthe standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for\nan accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed\na rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at\ndifferent infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using\nblood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition,\nwe evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of\nvenous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 49 patients with suspected lung cancer on routine CT imaging who underwent DCE-MRI scans and had final histopathologic diagnosis. Three TIC-derived metrics\n(maximum enhancement ratio, peak time [Tmax] and slope) and eight intensity histogram metrics (volume, integral, maximum, minimum, median, coefficient of variation [CoV], skewness, and kurtosis) were extracted from DCE-MRI images.\nTIC-derived and intensity histogram metrics were compared between benignity versus malignancy using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Associations between imaging metrics and malignancy risk were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic\nregression odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: There were 33 malignant lesions and 16 benign lesions based on histopathology. Lower CoV (OR=0.2 per 1-SD increase, p=0.0006), lower Tmax (OR=0.4 per 1-SD increase,\np=0.005), and steeper slope (OR=2.4 per 1-SD increase, p=0.010) were significantly associated with increased risk of malignancy.

During the next\ntwo months, it moved rapidly throughout China and spread to multiple countries through infected persons travelling by air. Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and\ncough. But in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop to the acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread\nvia droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human-to-human. Therefore, high-risk aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection\nof anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and\ndrafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne PPE should be\napplied to the health care providers. A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided and modified rapid\nsequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32102726", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32102625", "Title": "Detectable 2019-nCoV viral RNA in blood is a strong indicator for the further clinical severity.", "JournalName": "Emerging microbes & infections", "Date Added": "20200228", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection caused pneumonia. we retrospectively analyzed the virus presence in the pharyngeal swab, blood, and the anal swab detected by real-time PCR in the clinical lab.\nUnexpectedly, the 2109-nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28 patients).

Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent\nboth chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays,\nthe dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or\nmore. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI,\n95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely cases,\nwith 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 +/- 1.5\ndays; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 +/- 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to\nthe initial positive RT-PCR results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative.

However,\nthere are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the\nactual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of\nreported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias\nand risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health\nauthorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems.

It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive\nnumber (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. METHOD: We fitted the reported serial interval\n(mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied \"earlyR\" package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied \"projections\" package in\nR to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a\nmodel based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. RESULTS: The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the\nearly stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06-2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases\nfor the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384-1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced\nby 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981-1177) and 758 (697-817), respectively. CONCLUSION: The median with 95% CI of R0 of\nCOVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06-2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change\nof R0.

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of\nMedicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine,\nour team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on \"Four-Anti and Two-Balance\" for clinical practice. The \"Four-Anti and Two-Balance\"strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of\nwater, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes\nand chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute\nperiodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely\nidentifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The \"Four-Anti and Two-Balance\"strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness\nprogression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove\ninflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and\nalso short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation\nwas not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients\nwith long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as Lactobacillus and\nBifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the\nrisk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated\nChinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about\nviral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have\nbeen implemented in our center and achieved good results.

METHODS: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of\nZhejiang University School of Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The shortest\ninterval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on\nthe CT images were reviewed. RESULTS: The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in\nthe lungs during the first CT examination. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air\nbronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During hospitalization, GGO lesions in\nCOVID-19 patients gradually became rare, the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after\nadmission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%).

Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal\nmarkets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability\nto infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and\nthe recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for\nseveral lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses\ncan recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094589", "Tag": "COVID Default"}, {"PMID": "32094505", "Title": "Epitopes for a 2019-nCoV vaccine.", "JournalName": "Cellular & molecular immunology", "Date Added": "20200226", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 24", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094505", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32094336", "Title": "High expression of ACE2 receptor of 2019-nCoV on the epithelial cells of oral mucosa.", "JournalName": "International journal of oral science", "Date Added": "20200226", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 24", "Abstract": "It has been reported that ACE2 is the main host cell receptor of 2019-nCoV and plays a crucial role in the entry of virus into the cell to cause the\nfinal infection.

Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a\nnucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps).

We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with\nits natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide\nanalogues.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study\nsample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed and the relationship between them was analyzed. RESULTS:\nTotally 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58/80 (73%) of patients had cough, 61/80 (76%) of patients had high temperature levels. The most\nfrequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (GGO) (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%) and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an\naverage of 12+/-6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right\nlower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%) and the posterior basal segment\nof the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary inflammation index (PII) value was (34%+/-20%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the PII value was significantly correlated\nwith the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset and body temperature (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The common chest CT findings of COVID-19 are multiple GGO,\nconsolidation and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura. There are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms\nand laboratory results.

Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa,\nEgypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African\ncountries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. METHODS: We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to\nAfrica to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations\nMonitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. FINDINGS: Countries with the highest\nimportation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya)\nhave variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city\nof Beijing, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised\nin countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.

It has been proven that NCP can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical\nstaffs and inpatients. Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, now it is a difficult task that with\nthe premise of how to maximize the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, we can provide the highest quality\nmedical services to ensure the orderly development of previous clinical work. Referring to the \"Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for NCP (Trial Version 4 and 5)\" and combining the actual practice\nsituation in our hospital with the \"Summary of New Coronavirus Files of Shanghai Renji Hospital\", we summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation\nof the prevention and control of the NCP epidemiology, meanwhile under such situation aiming the procedure of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, we share the experiences\nof the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management. More importantly,\nwe introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating\nrooms and surgical instruments. The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only\nroutine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department. (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of NCP to patients and doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency\ncases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed NCP, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive\ntube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed NCP should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative\nroom with negative pressure (under-5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the\nmedical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with NCP must be protected by three-level. After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and\nbe isolated for 14 days.

Methods: Data of reported NCP cases and\nBaidu Migration Indexin all provinces of the country as of February 14, 2020 were collected. The correlation analysis between cumulative number of reported cases and the migration index from Hubei\nwas performed, and the imported risks from Hubei to different provinces across China were further evaluated. Results: A total of 49 970 confirmed cases were reported nationwide, of which 37\n884 were in Hubei Province. The average daily migration index from Hubei to other provinces was 312.09, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei were 117.95 and 194.16, respectively. The cumulative\nNCP cases of provinces was positively correlated with the migration index derived from Hubei province, also in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei, with correlation coefficients of 0.84, 0.84, and\n0.81. In linear model, population migration from Hubei Province, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei account for 71.2%, 70.1%, and 66.3% of the variation, respectively. The period of high exported\nrisk from Hubei occurred before January 27, of which the risks before January 23 mainly came from Wuhan, and then mainly from other cities in Hubei.

The virus knowledge is limited and especially about COVID-2019\npathogenesis. The Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID-2019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus. For selective pressure analysis fast-unconstrained\nBayesian approximation (FUBAR) was used. Homology modelling has been performed by SwissModel and HHPred servers. The presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus ORF1ab non structural protein 2 (nsp2) and\nnsp3 was tested by TMHMM, MEMSAT, and MEMPACK tools. Three-dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL. FUBAR analysis revealed the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure\n(P < .05). Position 723 in the COVID-2019 has a serine instead a glycine residue, while at aminoacidic position 1010 a proline instead an isoleucine. Significant (P < .05) pervasive\nnegative selection in 2416 sites (55%) was found. The positive selective pressure could account for some clinical features of this virus compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Bat\nSARS-like CoV. The stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for COVID-2019 high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could\nsuggest a potential mechanism differentiating COVID-2019 from SARS.

Methods: The correlation between ALT, AST and other liver\nenzyme changes condition and NCP patients' disease status reported in the literature was comprehensively analyzed. ACE2 expression in liver tissue for novel coronavirus was analyzed based on single cell sequencing\n(GSE115469) data. RNA-Seq method was used to analyze Ace2 expression and transcription factors related to its expression in liver tissues at various time-points after hepatectomy in mouse model of acute\nliver injury with partial hepatectomy. t-test or Spearman rank correlation analysis was used for statistical analysis. Results: ALT and AST were abnormally elevated in some patients with novel coronavirus infection,\nand the rate and extent of ALT and AST elevation in severe NCP patients were higher than those in non-severe patients. Liver tissue results of single cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry\nshowed that ACE2 was only expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of normal liver tissues, and very low in hepatocytes. In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial\nhepatectomy, Ace2 expression was down-regulated on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the normal level on the third day, and returned to normal level on\nseventh day when the liver recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. Whether this phenomenon suggests that the bile duct epithelial cells with positive expression of Ace2 participate in the process of\nliver regeneration after partial hepatectomy deserves further study. In RNA-Seq data, 77 transcription factors were positively correlated with the expression of ACE2 (r > 0.2, FDR < 0.05), which were\nmainly enriched in the development, differentiation, morphogenesis and cell proliferation of glandular epithelial cells. Conclusion: We assumed that in addition to the over activated inflammatory response in patients with NCP,\nthe up-regulation of ACE2 expression in liver tissue caused by compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from bile duct epithelial cells may also be the possible mechanism of liver tissue injury\ncaused by 2019 novel coronavirus infection.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32077659", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32077440", "Title": "[Preliminary Recommendations for Lung Surgery during 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic Period].", "JournalName": "Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer", "Date Added": "20200223", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 20", "Abstract": "In December 2019, China diagnosed the first patient with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the following development of the epidemic had a huge impact on China and the whole\nworld.

METHODS: Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection,\nwere extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community-acquired\ncases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug\nhypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients\nand current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients.\nBlood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P < .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P < .001) patients after hospital admission.

For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent\nplacement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an\nalternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases\nwith suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be\nadopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating\nroom after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according\nto the standard procedures.

This was followed by prevention programs\nrecommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. METHODS: Historical records on prevention and treatment of\ninfections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China\nsince the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for\npreventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. RESULTS: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di\nNei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM\ncontracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52;\nn=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and\ndischarge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus\nforsythia (Lianqiao). CONCLUSIONS: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk\npopulation.

We constructed 2-strain models to predict past outbreaks in the interval 2012-2016 and derive key epidemiological information for Macca, Madina and\nRiyadh. We approached variability in infection through three different disease incidence functions capturing social behavior in response to an epidemic (e.g. Bilinear, BL; Non-monotone, NM; and Saturated, SAT models). The\nbest model combination successfully anticipated the total number of MERS-CoV clinical cases for the 2015-2016 season and accurately predicted both the number of cases at the peak of seasonal incidence\nand the overall shape of the epidemic cycle. The evolution in the basic reproduction number (R0) warns that MERS-CoV may easily take an epidemic form. The best model correctly captures\nthis feature, indicating a high epidemic risk (1</=R0</=2,5) in Riyadh and Macca and confirming the alleged co-circulation of more than one strain.

The number of affected lobes, ground glass nodules (GGO), patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, patchy consolidation, fibrous stripes and irregular solid nodules\nin each patient's chest CT image were recorded. Additionally, we performed imaging follow-up of these patients. RESULTS: CT images of 63 confirmed patients were collected. M/F ratio: 33/30. The mean\nage was 44.9 +/- 15.2 years. The mean number of affected lobes was 3.3 +/- 1.8. Nineteen (30.2%) patients had one affected lobe, five (7.9%) patients had two affected lobes,\nfour (6.3%) patients had three affected lobes, seven (11.1%) patients had four affected lobes while 28 (44.4%) patients had 5 affected lobes.

Estimation of the basic\nreproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions\nand intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and\nmodel analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine\nand isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to\nincreasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control\nof the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with\na significant low peak value.

This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and\nanalyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the\nrespiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics,\nand treatment regimens. RESULTS: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale\nMarket. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart\npalpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with\nmost chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective\ndrugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably,\nearly respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms\nto dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest\nimaging.

We identified factors associated with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection among suspected cases presented with sign and symptoms of upper respiratory infection or exposure to the virus.\nWe also looked at the impact of medication history on virus transmission. Method: We included subjects with suspected MERS-CoV infection and confirmed cases of MERS infection. Subjects were excluded if\nthere were any missing data that prevent the final analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to report demographic data. Percentages and frequencies were used to summarize the categorical variables, while means\nand standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of MERS-CoV infection among the suspected cases. A value of p < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant. Results: A total of 16,189 suspected cases were identified, complete data were analyzed for 3154 to assess factors that are independently associated with MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection\nwas associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.06; 95% CI [1.02-1.098], P-value = 0.004), male gender (AOR = 1.617; 95% CI [1.365-1.77], P-value < 0.001) and diabetes (AOR\n= 1.68; 95% CI [1.346-1.848], P-value = 0.002.

Many studies have described how coronaviruses\nenter cells, but information on PEDV invasion strategies remains insufficient. Given that the differences in gene sequences and pathogenicity between classical and mutant strains of PEDV may lead to diverse\ninvasion mechanisms, this study focused on the cellular entry pathways and cellular transport of the PEDV GI and GII subtype strains in Vero cells and IPEC-J2 cells. We first characterized\nthe kinetics of PEDV entry into cells and found that the highest invasion rate of PEDV was approximately 33% in the IPEC-J2 cells and approximately 100% in the Vero cells.\nTo clarify the specific endocytic pathways, systematic research methods were used and showed that PEDV enters cells via the clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis pathways, in which dynamin II, clathrin heavy\nchain, Eps15, cholesterol, and caveolin-1 were indispensably involved. In addition, lipid raft extraction assay showed that PEDV can also enter cells through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the trafficking of\ninternalized PEDV, we found that PEDV entry into cells relied on low pH and internalized virions reached lysosomes through the early endosome-late endosome-lysosome pathway.

We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on\ninanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe\nAcute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9\ndays, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05-0.2% benzalkonium\nchloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.

In this study, we determined whether symptomatic respiratory viral\ninfections after lung transplantation induce circulating exosomes that contain lung-associated self-antigens and assessed whether these exosomes activate immune responses to self-antigens. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from lung transplant recipients\nwith symptomatic lower- and upper-tract respiratory viral infections and from non-symptomatic stable recipients. Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation; purity was determined using sucrose cushion; and presence of lung self-antigens, 20S\nproteasome, and viral antigens for rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were determined using immunoblot. Mice were immunized with circulating exosomes from each group and resulting differential immune responses and\nlung histology were analyzed. RESULTS: Exosomes containing self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens were detected at significantly higher levels (p < 0.05) in serum of recipients with symptomatic respiratory viral\ninfections (n=35) as compared with stable controls (n=32).

This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses.\nThe outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a\nfew other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We\ndeveloped two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with\nthis novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two\n2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least\nseven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control\nsamples were negative in the assays.

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is\nlimited. Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan\nHospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological,\ndemographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster\nof health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median\nage was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40\n[29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 x 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1])\noccurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed\ntomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin,\n89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory\ndistress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to\nARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs\n51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%]\nvs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched\nto extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).

Methods: 29 patients with\n2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 were selected as the study subjects.\nClinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three\ngroups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the\nchanges of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of\n2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients\nshowed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin. In most patients,serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was\nsignificantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased(15/29). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT findings of\ntypical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow\ncoexists with the solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the\nthree groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mildgroup. However, there were no statistically significant differences\nin serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05).

METHODS: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The\nnumber of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\n(SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. RESULTS: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential\ngrowth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403-540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was\nlikely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18-25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.

The virus belongs to the beta genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted\nthrough droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS\nin pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of\nthis disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may\ninhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines.

Cases have been exported to other\nChinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the\nnumber of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical\nprevention interventions. METHODS: We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec\n25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted\nthe national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly\nflight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were\nobtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A\nsusceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using\nthe resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). FINDINGS: In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2.68 (95% CrI 2.47-2.86) and that\n75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8-7.1). We estimated\nthat in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\nIf the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time\nbehind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas\nwith close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in\nmajor cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied\nfor quick deployment globally.

However, none of the deaths occurred during the\nisolation period, and no differences were observed in patient survival rate according to different isolation strategies.Although 116 participants in 3 HD units were incidentally exposed to MERS-CoV during the 2015\noutbreak in Korea, strict patient surveillance and proper isolation practice prevented secondary transmission of the virus.

METHODS: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we\nmodelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (gamma),\nwe estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative\npathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or\nvisiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. METHODS: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited\nthe Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with\nthe terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the\nvirus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the\nnine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99.98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and\nbat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus\nof the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had\na similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting\nbetacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host\nfacilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution,\nadaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR\nand were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49\n(49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55.5 years (SD 13.1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was\ndetected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.

METHODS: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant\nphylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13\nsequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5'-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3'-part spanning 24,341-30,696\npositions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3'-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike\nregions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does\nnot provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.

Media speculations may have increased this psychological\ndistress. The healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students'\nperception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. METHODS: We randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nA predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level\nthan males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 +/- 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and\nmedian (17.4 +/- 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported\nmild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1-10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety\nDisorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported\nsocial avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were\nfound to be non-significant.

Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in\n2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species\nand human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the\nsequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several\ncritical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly\nAsn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of\n2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections.\nThese analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.IMPORTANCE The recent\nemergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by\nSARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the\ngoals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models\nof viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This\nstudy provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31996437", "Tag": "COVID Epidemiology"}, {"PMID": "31996413", "Title": "Discovery of Bat Coronaviruses through Surveillance and Probe Capture-Based Next-Generation Sequencing.", "JournalName": "mSphere", "Date Added": "20200131", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 29", "Abstract": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) of bat origin have caused two pandemics in this century.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed\ncases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS: We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been\nreported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling\ntime and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS: Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%)\nwith onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95%\nconfidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.

Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted\nto the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of\nthe infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).

Common symptoms at onset of illness were\nfever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38),\nhaemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8.0 days [IQR 5.0-13.0]).\n26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.

Many viruses, including coronavirus, herpesvirus, and retrovirus, coopt host\ncellular TER94 for optimal viral invasion and replication. Previous proteomics analysis identified the association of TER94 with the budded virions (BVs) of baculovirus, an enveloped insect large DNA virus. Here,\nthe role of TER94 in the prototypic baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) life cycle was investigated. In virus-infected cells, TER94 accumulated in virogenic stroma (VS) at the early stage\nof infection and subsequently partially rearranged in the ring zone region. In the virions, TER94 was associated with the nucleocapsids of both BV and occlusion-derived virus (ODV). Inhibition of TER94\nATPase activity significantly reduced viral DNA replication and BV production. Electron/immunoelectron microscopy revealed that inhibition of TER94 resulted in the trapping of nucleocapsids within cytoplasmic vacuoles at the nuclear periphery\nfor BV formation and blockage of ODV envelopment at a premature stage within infected nuclei, which appeared highly consistent with its pivotal function in membrane biogenesis. Further analyses showed that\nTER94 was recruited to the VS or subnuclear structures through interaction with viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase, whereas inhibition of TER94 activity blocked the proper localization of replication-related viral\nproteins and morphogenesis of VS, providing an explanation for its role in viral DNA replication. Taken together, these data indicated the crucial functions of TER94 at multiple steps of the\nbaculovirus life cycle, including genome replication, BV formation, and ODV morphogenesis.IMPORTANCE TER94 constitutes an important AAA+ ATPase that associates with diverse cellular processes, including protein quality control, membrane fusion of\nthe Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum network, nuclear envelope reformation, and DNA replication. To date, little is known regarding the role(s) of TER94 in the baculovirus life cycle. In this\nstudy, TER94 was found to play a crucial role in multiple steps of baculovirus infection, including viral DNA replication and BV and ODV formation. Further evidence showed that the membrane\nfission/fusion function of TER94 is likely to be exploited by baculovirus for virion morphogenesis. Moreover, TER94 could interact with the viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase to transport and further\nrecruit viral replication-related proteins to establish viral replication factories.

Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the\nspike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover\npreviously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31801868", "Tag": "COVID Epidemiology Treatment"}, {"PMID": "31791902", "Title": "Combining Procalcitonin and Rapid Multiplex Respiratory Virus Testing for Antibiotic Stewardship in Older Adult Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Infection.", "JournalName": "Journal of the American Medical Directors Association", "Date Added": "20191204", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Virus infection is underevaluated in older adults with severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs). We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of combining point-of-care molecular viral test and serum procalcitonin\n(PCT) level for antibiotic stewardship in the emergency department (ED). DESIGN: A prospective twin-center cohort study was conducted between January 2017 and March 2018. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Older adult patients\nwho presented to the ED with SARIs received a rapid molecular test for 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test. MEASURES: To evaluate the clinical impact, we compared the outcomes\nof SARI patients between the experimental cohort and a propensity score-matched historical cohort. The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED. The secondary outcomes\nincluded duration of intravenous antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 676 patients were included, of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507\npatients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls, the experimental group had a significantly\nhigher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%, P = .007), neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%, P < .001), and shorter duration of intravenous\nantibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5 days, P < .001).

Subsequently, viral enzymatic\nactivities that suppress innate immune responses will be discussed, including activities causing host shut-off and manipulation of stress granule formation. Furthermore, viral protease-mediated immune evasion and viral manipulation of the\nubiquitin system will be addressed.

Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The\nvirus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing\nvaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status.\nFurthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined. RESULTS: We compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results.\nComparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p=0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza\nwere compared to three different control groups: all controls (N=6120), non-influenza positive controls (N=2880), and pan-negative controls (N=3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did\nnot vary much (range: 0.46-0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results. Vaccine\nderived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses, but also parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza\nvirus coinfections.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607599", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "31600567", "Title": "Environmental investigation of respiratory pathogens during the Hajj 2016 and 2018.", "JournalName": "Travel medicine and infectious disease", "Date Added": "20191011", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan - Feb", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections are common in the context of the Hajj pilgrimage and respiratory pathogens can be transmitted via contact with contaminated surfaces.

To date, the only proven route of transmission is the faecal-oral route, but a possible\nlocalisation of FCoV in the reproductive tract of tom cats is of concern, owing to the involvement of the male reproductive tract during FIP and to the presence of reproduction\ndisorders in FCoV-endemic feline catteries. The aim of the study was to investigate the presence and localisation of FCoV in semen and/or in the reproductive tract of tom cats, and\nits possible association with seroconversion and viraemic phase. METHODS: Blood, serum, semen and/or testicle samples were obtained from 46 tom cats. Serology was performed on 38 serum samples, nested reverse\ntranscriptase PCR (nRT-PCR) and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were performed on 39 blood samples and on 17 semen samples, and histology, immunohistochemistry and nRT-PCR were performed on 39 testicles.\nRESULTS: Twenty-four of 38 serum samples were positive on serology.

These viruses have also contributed internal genes to H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H10N8 viruses, which have been isolated from humans with infections\nand are a substantial public health threat. To investigate the potential pathogenic mechanism of the H9N2 virus, we performed serial lung-to-lung passage of an avirulent H9N2 avian influenza virus (A/Chicken/Shandong/416/2016\n[SD/416]) in mice to increase the pathogenicity of this virus. We generated a mouse-adapted (MA) virus that exhibited increased viral titers in the lungs, caused severe lung damage in mice,\nand induced body weight loss in mice; however, the avirulent parental virus did not cause any clinical symptoms in infected mice. Global gene expression analysis was performed and indicated that\nthe transcriptional responses of these viruses were distinct. The lungs of mice infected with the MA virus exhibited the downregulation of genes related to innate immunity and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, which\nwas not seen in infections with the avirulent parental virus.

We explored the clinical effects and economic benefits of expanding the current national influenza vaccination schedule in Mexico to include the school-aged population. Methods: A\nstatic 1-year model incorporating herd effect was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of expanding the current national influenza vaccination schedule of Mexico to include the school-aged population. We performed a\ncross-sectional epidemiological study using influenza records (2009\u20132018), death records (2010\u20132015), and discharge and hospitalisation records (2010\u20132016), from the databases of Mexico\u2019s Influenza Surveillance System (SISVEFLU), the National Mortality Epidemiological and\nStatistical System (SEED), and the Automated Hospital Discharge System (SAEH), respectively.

The N-terminal fragment of a giant tegument protein, UL36, encoded by the Marek\u2019s disease (MD) virus\n(MDV), encompasses a putative DUB (UL36-DUB) and shares no homology with any known DUBs. The N-terminus 75 kDa fragment of UL36 exists in MD T lymphoma cells at a high\nlevel and participates in MDV pathogenicity. (2) Methods: To characterize deubiquitinating activity and substrate specificity of UL36-DUB, the UL36 N-terminal fragments, UL36(323), UL36(480), and mutants were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac\nsystem. The deubiquitinating activity and substrate specificity of these recombinant UL36-DUBs were analyzed using various ubiquitin (Ub) or ubiquitin-like (UbL) substrates and activity-based deubiquitinating enzyme probes. (3) Results: The results\nindicated that wild type UL36-DUBs show a different hydrolysis ability against varied types of ubiquitin chains. These wild type UL36-DUBs presented the highest activity to K11, K48, and K63 linkage\nUb chains, weak activity to K6, K29, and K33 Ub chains, and no activity to K27 linkage Ub chain. UL36 has higher cleavage efficiency for K48 and K63 poly-ubiquitin than\nlinear ubiquitin chain (M1-Ub4), but no activity on various ubiquitin-like modifiers. The mutation of C98 and H234 residues eliminated the deubiquitinating activity of UL36-DUB. D232A mutation impacted, but did not\neliminated UL36(480) activity. The Ub-Br probe can bind to wild type UL36-DUB and mutants UL36(480)H234A and UL36(480)D232A, but not C98 mutants. These in vitro results suggested that the C98 and\nH234 are essential catalytic residues of UL36-DUB. UL36-DUB exhibited a strict substrate specificity.

Consequently,\nalmost all recent IV pandemics have exhibited resistance to commercial antiviral vaccines. To overcome this challenge, an antiviral target is needed that is effective regardless of genetic mutations. Main body:\nIn particular, hemagglutinin (HA), a highly conserved surface protein across many IV strains, could be an effective antiviral target as it mediates binding of IVs with host cell receptors, which\nis crucial for membrane fusion. HA has 6 disulfide bonds that can easily bind with the surfaces of gold nanoparticles. Herein, we fabricated porous gold nanoparticles (PoGNPs) via a surfactant-free\nemulsion method that exhibited strong affinity for disulfide bonds due to gold\u2013thiol interactions, and provided extensive surface area for these interactions. A remarkable decrease in viral infectivity was demonstrated by\nincreased cell viability results after exposing MDCK cells to various IV strains (H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2) treated with PoGNP. Most of all, the viability of MDCK cells infected with all\nIV strains increased to 96.8% after PoGNP treatment of the viruses compared to 33.9% cell viability with non-treated viruses. Intracellular viral RNA quantification by real-time RT-PCR also confirmed that PoGNP\nsuccessfully inhibited viral membrane fusion by blocking the viral entry process through conformational deformation of HA.

The implementation of auxiliary diagnosis support algorithm for medical text data faces challenges with\ninterpretability and creditability. The improvement of clinical diagnostic techniques means not only the improvement of diagnostic accuracy but also the further study of diagnostic basis. Traditional research methods for diagnostic\nmarkers often require a large amount of time and economic costs. Research objects are often dozens of samples, and it is, therefore, difficult to synthesize large amounts of data. Therefore,\nthe comprehensiveness and reliability of traditional methods have yet to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of a model that can automatically diagnose diseases and automatically provide a diagnostic basis at\nthe same time has a positive effect on the improvement of medical diagnostic techniques. Methods: Here, we established an auxiliary diagnostic tool based on attention deep learning algorithm to diagnostic\nhyperlipemia and automatically predict the corresponding diagnostic markers using hematological parameters. In this paper, we not only demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to automatically diagnose diseases using text-based\nmedical data, such as physiological parameters, but also demonstrated its ability to forecast disease diagnostic markers. Human physiological parameters are used as input to the model, and the doctor\u2019s diagnosis\nresults as an output. Through the attention layer, the degree of attention of the model to different physiological parameters can be obtained, that is, the model provides a diagnostic basis.\nResults: It achieved 94% ACC, 97.48% AUC, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity with the test dataset. All the above samples are drawn from clinical practice. Moreover, the model predicted the\ndiagnostic markers of hyperlipidemia by the attention mechanism, and the results were fully agreeable to the golden criteria.

Here, we review the world\u2019s current state of emerging infectious disease preparedness, the ecological and evolutionary knowledge needed to\nanticipate disease emergence, the roles that China and the USA currently play as sources and solutions to mitigating risk, and the next steps needed to better protect the global community\nfrom zoonotic disease.Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this article (10.1007/s10393-020-01471-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32016718", "Tag": "COVID Case Control Epidemiology Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32072297", "Title": "Important roles of dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline in human nutrition and health.", "JournalName": "Amino Acids", "Date Added": "20200218", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "Taurine (a sulfur-containing \u03b2-amino acid), creatine (a metabolite of arginine, glycine and methionine), carnosine (a dipeptide; \u03b2-alanyl-l-histidine), and 4-hydroxyproline (an imino acid; also often referred to as an amino acid)\u00a0were\ndiscovered in cattle, and the discovery of anserine (a methylated product of carnosine; \u03b2-alanyl-1-methyl-l-histidine) also originated with cattle. These five nutrients are highly abundant in beef, and have important physiological\nroles in anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory reactions, as well as neurological, muscular, retinal, immunological and cardiovascular function. Of particular note, taurine, carnosine, anserine, and creatine are absent from plants, and hydroxyproline\nis negligible in many plant-source foods. Consumption of 30\u00a0g dry beef can fully meet daily physiological needs of the healthy 70-kg adult human for taurine and carnosine, and can also\nprovide large amounts of creatine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline to improve human nutrition and health, including metabolic, retinal, immunological,\u00a0muscular, cartilage,\u00a0neurological, and cardiovascular health.

With the widespread use of insecticides, the insecticide\nresistance of G. pyloalis has becomes increasingly apparent. In order to find other effective methods to control G. pyloalis, this study performed a transcriptome analysis of the midgut, integument, and\nwhole larvae. Transcriptome data were annotated with KEGG and GO, and they have been shown to be of high quality by RT-qPCR. The different significant categories of differentially expressed genes\nbetween the midgut and the integument suggested that the transcriptome data could be used for next analysis.

However,\nIndia did not succeed to achieve the target of millennium development goal to reduced maternal mortality ratio by 2015. Also, there is substantial inequality exist at the regional, geographic, economic,\nand social level, and various socioeconomic factors contribute to the significantly large share in inequality in utilisation of maternal health care in India. Methods: Using data from the National Family\nHealth Survey (2005 and 2015), this study examined the degree of inequality exist in maternal health care namely full antenatal care (full ANC), skilled attendants at birth (SBA), and postnatal\ncare (PNC) in rural India. Descriptive statistics, concentration index (CI), and Wagstaff decomposition method have been performed to understand the pattern of maternal health care utilisation, and to explain the\nextent of inequality in maternal health care utilisation. Results: The study revealed that a substantial gap across socioeconomic groups exist in utilisation of maternal health care has significantly reduced in\nrural India during 2005\u201316. The results found a noticeable improvement in maternal health care utilisation, especially in utilisation of skilled attendants at birth (SBA).

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading causative agent of bronchiolitis,\nwhereas RV starts to dominate after 1\u00a0year of age. Breathing difficulty induced by either of these viruses is associated with later asthma, but the risk is higher for those who\nsuffer from severe RV-induced wheezing. The asthma development associated with these viruses has unique mechanisms, but in general, RV is a risk factor for later atopic asthma, whereas RSV is\nmore likely associated with later non-atopic asthma. Treatments that inhibit inflammation (corticosteroids, omalizumab) effectively decrease RV-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations. The anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, decreases the risk of severe\nRSV illness and subsequent recurrent wheeze. A better understanding of personal and environmental risk factors and inflammatory mechanisms leading to asthma is crucial in developing new strategies for the prevention\nand treatment of asthma.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989228", "Tag": "COVID Case Control Epidemiology Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32155205", "Title": "The fecal microbiota of healthy donor horses and geriatric recipients undergoing fecal microbial transplantation for the treatment of diarrhea.", "JournalName": "PLoS ONE", "Date Added": "20200310", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "Background and aims: Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT), a treatment for certain gastrointestinal conditions associated with dysbiosis in people, is also empirically employed in horses with colitis.

The negative clinical results may be due to inadequate mean airway pressure (mPaw) settings in HFOV. Our objective was\nto evaluate the air distribution, ventilatory and hemodynamic effects of individual mPaw titration during HFOV in ARDS animal based on oxygenation and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Methods: ARDS was introduced\nwith repeated bronchoalveolar lavage followed by injurious mechanical ventilation in ten healthy male pigs (51.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u00a0kg).

The objective of this study was to examine the epidemiology of dengue and determine the seasonal\npattern of dengue and its associate to climate factors in Bangkok, Thailand, from 2003 to 2017. Methods: The dengue cases in Bangkok were collected monthly during the study period. The\ntime-series data were extracted into the trend, seasonal, and random components using the seasonal decomposition procedure based on loess. The Spearman correlation analysis and artificial neuron network (ANN) were used\nto determine the association between climate variables (humidity, temperature, and rainfall) and dengue cases in Bangkok. Results: The seasonal-decomposition procedure showed that the seasonal component was weaker than the trend\ncomponent for dengue cases during the study period. The Spearman correlation analysis showed that rainfall and humidity played a role in dengue transmission with correlation efficiency equal to 0.396 and\n0.388, respectively. ANN showed that precipitation was the most crucial factor. The time series multivariate Poisson regression model revealed that increasing 1% of rainfall corresponded to an increase of 3.3%\nin the dengue cases in Bangkok.

Salt stress is seriously limiting its production and distribution. Due to lacking of reference genome, transcriptome sequencing is offering a rapid approach for crop improvement with promising agronomic\ntraits and stress adaptability. Results: Five cDNA libraries were prepared from the third true leaf of hexaploid sweetpotato at seedlings stage (Xuzi-8 cultivar) treated with 200\u2009mM NaCl for 0, 1,\n6, 12, 48\u2009h. Using second and third generation technology, Illumina sequencing generated 170,344,392 clean high-quality long reads that were assembled into 15,998 unigenes with an average length 2178 base pair\nand 96.55% of these unigenes were functionally annotated in the NR protein database. A number of 537 unigenes failed to hit any homologs which may be considered as novel genes.\nThe current results indicated that sweetpotato plants behavior during the first hour of salt stress was different than the other three time points.

Understanding its relationships with\nthe deprivation is key to develop policies and evaluate interventions that are aimed at reducing health inequalities. However, methodological challenges in the analysis of LEB data arise from the fact\nthat different Government agencies often provide spatially aggregated information on LEB and the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) at different spatial scales. Our objective is to develop a geostatistical framework\nthat, unlike existing methods of inference, allows to carry out spatially continuous prediction while dealing with spatial misalignment of the areal-level data. Methods\u00a0: We developed a model-based geostatistical approach for\nthe joint analysis of LEB and IMD, when these are available over different partitions of the study region. We model the spatial correlation in LEB and IMD across the areal\nunits using inter-point distances based on a regular grid covering the whole of the study area. The advantages and strengths of the new methodology are illustrated through an analysis of\nLEB and IMD data from the Liverpool district council. Results\u00a0: We found that the effect of IMD on LEB is stronger in males than in females, explaining about 63.35% of\nthe spatial variation in LEB in the former group and 38.92% in the latter. We also estimate that LEB is about 8.5 years lower between the most and least deprived\narea of Liverpool for men, and 7.1 years for women. Finally, we find that LEB, both in males and females, is at least 80% likely to be above the England\nwide average only in some areas falling in the electoral wards of Childwall, Woolton and Church. Conclusion\u00a0: The novel model-based geostatistical framework provides a feasible solution to the spatial misalignment\nproblem. More importantly, the proposed methodology has the following advantages over existing methods used model LEB: (1) it can deliver spatially continuous inferences using spatially aggregated data; (2) it can\nbe applied to any form of misalignment with information provided at a range of spatial scales, from areal-level to pixel-level.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32131836", "Tag": "COVID Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32131787", "Title": "Socio-economic inequalities in the multiple dimensions of access to healthcare: the case of South Africa.", "JournalName": "BMC Public Health", "Date Added": "20200304", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "Background: The National Development Plan (NDP) strives that South Africa, by 2030, in pursuit of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) achieve a significant shift in the equity of health services provision.\nThis paper provides a diagnosis of the extent of socio-economic inequalities in health and healthcare using an integrated conceptual framework.

However, many of the computational tools for strain design are built around Flux Balance\nAnalysis (FBA), which makes assumptions that preclude direct integration of metabolomics data into the underlying models. Finding a way to retain the advantages of FBA\u2019s linear structure while relaxing some\nof its assumptions could allow us to account for metabolite levels and metabolite-dependent regulation in strain design tools built from FBA, improving the accuracy of predictions made by these tools.\nWe designed, implemented, and characterized a modeling strategy based on Dynamic FBA (DFBA), called Linear Kinetics-Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (LK-DFBA), to satisfy these specifications. Our strategy adds constraints describing the\ndynamics and regulation of metabolism that are strictly linear. We evaluated LK-DFBA against alternative modeling frameworks using simulated noisy data from a small in silico model and a larger model\nof central carbon metabolism in E. coli, and compared each framework\u2019s ability to recapitulate the original system. Results: In the smaller model, we found that we could use regression from\na dynamic flux estimation (DFE) with an optional non-linear parameter optimization to reproduce metabolite concentration dynamic trends more effectively than an ordinary differential equation model with generalized mass action rate\nlaws when tested under realistic data sampling frequency and noise levels. We observed detrimental effects across all tested modeling approaches when metabolite time course data were missing, but found these\neffects to be smaller for LK-DFBA in most cases. With the E. coli model, we produced qualitatively reasonable results with similar properties to the smaller model and explored two different\nparameterization structures that yield trade-offs in computation time and accuracy. Conclusions: LK-DFBA allows for calculation of metabolite concentrations and considers metabolite-dependent regulation while still retaining many computational advantages of FBA.\nThis provides the proof-of-principle for a new metabolic modeling framework with the potential to create genome-scale dynamic models and the potential to be applied in strain engineering tools that currently\nuse FBA.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122331", "Tag": "COVID Case Control Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32122337", "Title": "Coexistence and cooperation in structured habitats.", "JournalName": "BMC Ecology", "Date Added": "20200302", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "Background: Natural habitats are typically structured, imposing constraints on inhabiting populations and their interactions.

They include diplonemids, representing arguably the most species-rich clade of marine planktonic eukaryotes; trypanosomatids, which\nare notorious parasites of medical and veterinary importance; and free-living euglenids. These different lifestyles, and particularly the transition from free-living to parasitic, likely require different metabolic capabilities. We carried out\na comparative genomic analysis across euglenozoan diversity to see how changing repertoires of enzymes and structural features correspond to major changes in lifestyles. Results: We find a gradual loss of\ngenes encoding enzymes in the evolution of kinetoplastids, rather than a sudden decrease in metabolic capabilities corresponding to the origin of parasitism, while diplonemids and euglenids maintain more metabolic versatility.\nDistinctive characteristics of molecular machines such as kinetochores and the pre-replication complex that were previously considered specific to parasitic kinetoplastids were also identified in their free-living relatives. Therefore, we argue\nthat they represent an ancestral rather than a derived state, as thought until the present. We also found evidence of ancient redundancy in systems such as NADPH-dependent thiol-redox. Only the\ngenus Euglena possesses the combination of trypanothione-, glutathione-, and thioredoxin-based systems supposedly present in the euglenozoan common ancestor, while other representatives of the phylum have lost one or two of\nthese systems. Lastly, we identified convergent losses of specific metabolic capabilities between free-living kinetoplastids and ciliates. Although this observation requires further examination, it suggests that certain eukaryotic lineages are predisposed\nto such convergent losses of key enzymes or whole pathways. Conclusions: The loss of metabolic capabilities might not be associated with the switch to parasitic lifestyle in kinetoplastids, and the\npresence of a highly divergent (or unconventional) kinetochore machinery might not be restricted to this protist group. The data derived from the transcriptomes of free-living early branching prokinetoplastids suggests that\nthe pre-replication complex of Trypanosomatidae is a highly divergent version of the conventional machinery.

However, catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) causes great harm to the quality of life of households and pushes them\ninto poverty. The objective of this paper is to assess the effect of medical insurance on CHE in China and compare the financial protection effects of different medical insurances. Methods:\nPanel data were obtained from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) conducted in the years of 2012, 2014, and 2016. CHE incidence was measured by performing a headcount, and its intensity\nwas estimated using overshoot and mean positive overshoot (MPO). In addition, concentration index (CI) was used to measure the degree of socioeconomic inequality of CHE occurrence. Furthermore, random effects panel\nProbit regression model was employed to assess the effect of medical insurance on CHE. Lastly, random effects panel Logit regression model was adopted to perform a robustness check. Results: From\n2012 to 2016, the total CHE incidence jumped from 15.05% to 15.24%, and the CI in CHE changed from \u2212\u20090.0076 to \u2212\u20090.1512. Moreover, the total overshoot increased from 0.0333 to\n0.0344, while the total MPO grew from 0.2213 to 0.2257. Furthermore, the global regression results show that residents covered by Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) were linked to a decreased probability\nof experiencing CHE. In addition, the regression results by gender indicate that SMI coverage for male residents had a significant effect on the prevention of CHE, while the effect was\nnot significant for female residents. The regression results by health status show that SMI had a significant impact on reducing the likelihood of CHE occurrence for healthy residents, whilst the\nimpact was not significant for unhealthy residents. Lastly, the robustness check results were consistent with those of previous findings. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that CHE incidence and\nintensity became relatively higher among households. In addition, CHE occurrence was concentrated among the poorer households and the equality status worsened. Moreover, financial protection effects of the four medical insurance\nschemes against CHE varied significantly. Furthermore, the protection effect of SMI against CHE shows significant gender and health status disparities.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32127784", "Tag": "COVID Case Control Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32175514", "Title": "Fully Dried Two-Dimensional Paper Network for Enzymatically Enhanced Detection of Nucleic Acid Amplicons.", "JournalName": "ACS Omega", "Date Added": "20200226", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 10", "Abstract": "Two-dimensional paper networks (2DPNs) have enabled the use of paper-based platforms to perform multistep immunoassays for detection of pathogenic diseases at the point-of-care.

Twenty-four piglets fed a milk replacer were randomly allocated into one of three groups (Control, PEDV, and\nPEDV + PR). After a 5-day period of adaption, piglets (n = 8/group) in the PEDV + PR were orally administered with PR (0.5 mg/kg body weight) between days 5\nand 9, whereas piglets in the other two groups received the same volume of liquid milk replacer.

One hour later, cells in the Control and PEDV groups were cultured in\nserum-free DMEM, while cells in the PEDV + PR group were supplemented with PR. After 36 h of culture, cells were harvested. PR attenuated the reductions in cell proliferation in\nvitro and growth performance in PEDV-infected piglets, and inhibited PEDV replication and the expression of several cytokines (including IL-8) both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic analyses identified that the\nabundances of 29 proteins in the ileum were altered by PEDV infection and restored to the control level by PR. Pathway analyses revealed that PR restored the expression of several\ninterferon-stimulated genes and selectively upregulated the expression of guanylate-binding proteins.

This lectin was engineered from gene models identified in a\ntropical rainforest tree root transcriptome and is unusual in its six canonical mannose binding domains (QxDxNxVxY), each with a unique amino acid sequence.

SADS-CoV-infected cells showed evidence of apoptosis in\nvitro and in vivo. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis and reduction in SADS-CoV replication, suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway.\nFurthermore, SADS-CoV infection activated the initiators caspase-8 and -9 and upregulated FasL and Bid cleavage, demonstrating a crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

Farrowing stall dimensions have generally remained\nthe same over the past 50 years in the United States, even though the sizes of both the sows and litters have increased considerably. This extensive field study investigated if\nsow and piglet productivity would be affected when housed in stalls of traditional layout, additional area for the piglets, or additional area for the sow. All three layouts were also\ntested with use of one or two supplementary heat lamps in the creep area. Results show that stall layout and number of heat lamps had no statistical impact on production\noutcomes. However, seasonal differences, sow parity, and number of litter mates did have significant effects. Providing larger stalls or an additional heat lamp costs more for the producer but did\nnot yield production improvements. Abstract: Most farrowing facilities in the United States use stalls and heat lamps to improve sow and piglet productivity. This study investigated these factors by comparing\nproduction outcomes for three different farrowing stall layouts (traditional, expanded creep area, expanded sow area) and use of one or two heat lamps. Data were collected on 427 sows and\ntheir litters over one year. Results showed no statistical differences due to experimental treatment for any of the production metrics recorded, excluding percent stillborn. Parity one sows had fewer piglets\nborn alive (p < 0.001), lower percent mortality (p = 0.001) and over-lay (p = 0.003), and a greater number of piglets weaned (p < 0.001) with lower average daily\nweight gain (ADG) (p < 0.001) and more uniform litters (p = 0.001) as compared to higher parity sows. Farrowing turn, associated with group/seasonal changes, had a significant impact on\nmost of the production metrics measured. Number of piglets born influenced the percent stillborn (p < 0.001). Adjusted litter size had a significant impact on percent mortality (p < 0.001),\npercent over-lay (p < 0.001), and number of piglets weaned (p < 0.001). As the number of piglets weaned per litter increased, both piglet ADG and litter uniformity decreased (p\n< 0.001).

Sickle hemoglobin polymerizes in the deoxygenated state, resulting in erythrocyte membrane deformation, vascular occlusion, and hemolysis. Vascular occlusion and increased blood viscosity\nresults in functional asplenia and immune deficiency in early childhood, resulting in life-long increased susceptibility to serious bacterial infections. Infection remains a main cause of overall mortality in patients with\nSCD in low- and middle-income countries due to increased exposure to pathogens, increased co-morbidities such as malnutrition, lower vaccination rates, and diminished access to definitive care, including antibiotics and blood.\nThus, the greatest gains in preventing infection-associated mortality can be achieved by addressing these factors for SCD patients in austere environments. In contrast, in high-income countries, perinatal diagnosis of SCD,\nantimicrobial prophylaxis, vaccination, aggressive use of antibiotics for febrile episodes, and the availability of contemporary critical care resources have resulted in a significant reduction in deaths from infection; however, chronic\norgan injury is problematic. All clinicians, regardless of their discipline, who assume the care of SCD patients must understand the importance of infectious disease as a contributor to death and\ndisability.

This study investigated the safety of a proprietary extract of C. sativa, consisting of 9% hemp extract (of which 6.27% is CBD) and 91% olive oil. The mutagenic potential\nof the hemp extract was evaluated with the AMES assay inclusive of a hepatic drug metabolizing mix (S9) rich in CYP enzymes. The test article did not elicit evidence of\nbacterial mutagenicity. GLP compliant 14-day and a 90-day toxicity study were conducted. Olive oil was used as a control. The 90-day study had a 28-day recovery period. Treatments for the\n14-day non-recovery range-finding study were 0, 1000, 2000 and 4000\u2009mg test article/kg body weight (bw)/day for 14 days. There was a non-statistically significant (p\u2009>\u20090.05) decrease in body weights for the\nmale and female rats receiving the test article.

A major virulence factor of P. gulae consists of a 41-kDa filamentous appendage (FimA)\non the cell surface, which is classified into three genotypes: A, B, and C. Thus far, inhibition of periodontal disease in dogs remains difficult. The present study assessed the inhibitory\neffects of a combination of clindamycin and interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) formulation against P. gulae and periodontal disease. Growth of P. gulae was significantly inhibited by clindamycin; this inhibition had a\ngreater effect on type C P. gulae than on type A and B isolates. In contrast, the IFN-\u03b1 formulation inhibited the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and COX-2 elicited by type A\nand B isolates, but not that elicited by type C isolates. Furthermore, periodontal recovery was promoted by the administration of both clindamycin and IFN-\u03b1 formulation to dogs undergoing periodontal treatment;\nmoreover, this combined treatment reduced the number of FimA genotypes in oral specimens from treated dogs.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of\nsuspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The\nnature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. Methods: It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data\nfrom a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases\nand to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. Results: Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. These confirmed cases (67.2%\nof which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD\u2009\u00b1\u200922.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed\ncases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male\ngender, and summer season admission. Conclusion: The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and\nmanagement of such a contagious disease.

For the two Fanconi\nanemia (FA) patients (HIO-104 and 106, previously published as FA-A#1 IND-iPS1 and FA-A#2 IND-iPS3), FANCA expression was reconstituted as a prerequisite for generation of HIO via lentiviral expression of a\ndoxycycline inducible construct. For radiosensitivity analysis, FANCA deficient and FANCA rescued as well as wtHIO were sham treated or irradiated with 4Gy photon, proton or carbon ions at HIT, respectively.\nImmunofluorescence staining of HIO for 53BP1-foci was performed 1 h post IR and gene expression analyses was performed 12 and 48 h post IR. 53BP1-foci numbers and size correlated with\nthe higher RBE of carbon ions. A FANCA dependent differential gene expression in response to radiation was found (p < 0.01, ANOVA; n = 1071 12 h; n = 1100\n48 h). Pathways associated with FA and DNA-damage repair i.e., transcriptional coupled nucleotide excision repair, homology-directed repair and translational synthesis were found to be differentially regulated in FANCA deficient HIO.\nNext, differential regulated genes were investigated as a function of radiation quality (RQ, p < 0.05, ANOVA; n = 742 12 h; n = 553 48 h). Interestingly, a gradual\nincrease or decrease of gene expression was found to correlate with the three main qualities, from photon to proton and carbon irradiation. Clustering separated high-linear energy transfer irradiation with carbons\nfrom proton and photon irradiation. Genes associated with dual incision steps of TC-NER were differentially regulated in photon vs. proton and carbon irradiation. Consequently, SUMO3, ALC1, POLE4, PCBP4, MUTYH expression\ncorrelated with the higher RBE of carbon ions. An interaction between the two studied parameters FA and RQ was identified (p < 0.01, 2-way ANOVA n = 476). A comparison\nof genes regulated as a function of FA, RQ and RBE suggest a role for p53 interacting genes BRD7, EWSR1, FBXO11, FBXW8, HMGB1, MAGED2, PCBP4, and RPS27 as modulators of\nFA in response to radiation. This proof of concept study demonstrates that patient tailored evaluation of GI response to radiation is feasible via generation of HIO and comparative transcriptome profiling.\nThis methodology can now be further explored for a personalized assessment of GI radiosensitivity and RBE estimation.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32085439", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32148499", "Title": "Molecular Diagnosis of Pneumonia Using Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assay RespiFinder\u00ae SMART 22 FAST in a Group of Moroccan Infants.", "JournalName": "Advances in Virology", "Date Added": "20200218", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "Background: In Morocco, pediatric pneumonia remains a serious public health problem, as it constitutes the first cause of mortality due to infectious diseases. The etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract\ninfections is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to use Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identification. Objectives: In this paper, we\npresent the clinical results of pediatric pneumonia and describe their etiology by using molecular diagnosis. Study design: Tracheal secretion was collected from infants presenting respiratory distress isolated or associated with\nsystemic signs, attending the unit of Neonatology between December 1, 2016, and Mai 31, 2018. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder\u00ae SMART 22 FAST which potentially detects 18 viruses\nand 4 bacteria. Results: Of the 86 infants considered in this study (mean age 31\u2009\u00b1\u200919 days) suspected of acute respiratory tract infections, 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple\nviruses or/and bacteria. The majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%),\ninfluenza A (3%), influenza H1N1 (1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainfluenza virus type 4 (2%).

Nutritional status was calculated by z-scores according to weight-for-age z-scores, length or height-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-height z-scores. Nasopharyngeal\naspirates (NPAs) were obtained and viral respiratory pathogens were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) load was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. NPA and plasma\nleptin level were measured. Clinical data and nutritional status were recorded, and patients were followed up until hospital discharge. Viral coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more\nviruses detected in the same respiratory sample. Severity of illness was determined by length of hospitalization and duration of oxygen therapy.Results: Children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral\ncoinfection than those with normal weight (71% obese vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.013; 68% overweight vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.004).

A species is therefore defined by both core genes shared between all individuals and accessory\ngenes segregating presence-absence variation. There is growing evidence that eukaryotes, similar to bacteria, show intra-specific variability in gene content. However, it remains largely unknown how functionally relevant such a pangenome\nstructure is for eukaryotes and what mechanisms underlie the emergence of highly polymorphic genome structures. Results: Here, we establish a reference-quality pangenome of a fungal pathogen of wheat based on\n19 complete genomes from isolates sampled across six continents. Zymoseptoria tritici causes substantial worldwide losses to wheat production due to rapidly evolved tolerance to fungicides and evasion of host resistance.\nWe performed transcriptome-assisted annotations of each genome to construct a global pangenome. Major chromosomal rearrangements are segregating within the species and underlie extensive gene presence-absence variation. Conserved orthogroups account for\nonly ~\u200960% of the species pangenome. Investigating gene functions, we find that the accessory genome is enriched for pathogenesis-related functions and encodes genes involved in metabolite production, host tissue degradation\nand manipulation of the immune system. De novo transposon annotation of the 19 complete genomes shows that the highly diverse chromosomal structure is tightly associated with transposable element content. Furthermore,\ntransposable element expansions likely underlie recent genome expansions within the species.

Metabolome analysis identified 122 metabolites about flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and terpenoids, of which 57 were differentially accumulated between the two cytotypes.

Identifying location-specific seasonality characteristics is useful for\nplanning interventions. While most existing maps of malaria seasonality use fixed thresholds of rainfall, temperature, and/or vegetation indices to identify suitable transmission months, we construct a statistical modelling framework for\ncharacterising the seasonal patterns derived directly from monthly health facility data. Methods: With data from 2669 of the 3247 health facilities in Madagascar, a spatiotemporal regression model was used to\nestimate seasonal patterns across the island. In the absence of catchment population estimates or the ability to aggregate to the district level, this focused on the monthly proportions of total\nannual cases by health facility level. The model was informed by dynamic environmental covariates known to directly influence seasonal malaria trends. To identify operationally relevant characteristics such as the transmission\nstart months and associated uncertainty measures, an algorithm was developed and applied to model realisations. A seasonality index was used to incorporate burden information from household prevalence surveys and summarise\n\u2018how seasonal\u2019 locations are relative to their surroundings. Results: Positive associations were detected between monthly case proportions and temporally lagged covariates of rainfall and temperature suitability. Consistent with the existing\nliterature, model estimates indicate that while most parts of Madagascar experience peaks in malaria transmission near March\u2013April, the eastern coast experiences an earlier peak around February. Transmission was estimated to\nstart in southeast districts before southwest districts, suggesting that indoor residual spraying should be completed in the same order. In regions where the data suggested conflicting seasonal signals or two\ntransmission seasons, estimates of seasonal features had larger deviations and therefore less certainty.

Results: A total of 452 patients (mean age 71.4\u2009\u00b1\u200914.7\u00a0years; 76.7% men) were enrolled for analysis. They were divided into high GV (43.4%, 196/452) and low\nGV (56.6%, 256/512) groups using MAGE 65\u00a0mg/dL as the cut-off point. Patients with high GV tended to have higher HbA1c (6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8% vs. 5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and were more likely to have\ndiabetes mellitus (DM) (50.0% vs. 23.4%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) compared with those in the low GV group. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that a high GV was associated with increased 30-day mortality (log-rank test,\np\u2009=\u20090.018). The association remained strong in the non-DM (log-rank test, p\u2009=\u20090.035), but not in the DM (log-rank test, p\u2009=\u20090.254) group. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified that high APACHE\nII score (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.045, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.013\u20131.078), high serum lactate level at 0\u00a0h (aHR 1.009, 95% CI 1.003\u20131.014), having chronic airway disease (aHR 0.478, 95%\nCI 0.302\u20130.756), high mean day 1 glucose (aHR 1.008, 95% CI 1.000\u20131.016), and high MAGE (aHR 1.607, 95% CI 1.008\u20132.563) were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. The association with\n30-day mortality remained consistent when using CoV to assess GV. Conclusions: We found that approximately 40% of the septic patients had a high early GV, defined as MAGE >\u200965\u00a0mg/dL. Higher\nGV within 24\u00a0h of ICU admission was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality.

As\na host factor, PACT provides protection against the pathogenic influenza A virus by interacting with IAV polymerase and activating the IFN-I response. To verify the whether IGEs suppress IAV replication\nin a PACT-dependent manner, IAV RNA replication, expression of PACT and the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in A549 cells were detected; the levels of IFN\u03b2, PACT and PKR in mouse lung\ntissues were determined; and the activity of IAV polymerase was evaluated in PACT-compromised cells.

Such contrast agents are normally restricted to extracellular\ndomains, however, by attaching cationic fluorescent dyes, they can be made cell-permeable and allow for both optical and magnetic resonance detection. To reach neurons, these agents also need to cross\nthe blood-brain barrier. Focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles has been shown to enhance the permeability of this barrier, allowing molecules into the brain non-invasively, locally and transiently. The goal of\nthis study was to investigate whether combining fluorescent rhodamine with a gadolinium complex would form a dual-modal contrast agent that could label neurons in vivo when delivered to the mouse\nbrain with focused ultrasound and microbubbles.Methods: Gadolinium complexes were combined with a fluorescent, cationic rhodamine unit to form probes with fluorescence and relaxivity properties suitable for in vivo applications. The\nleft hemisphere of female C57bl/6 mice (8-10 weeks old; 19.07 \u00b1 1.56 g; n = 16) was treated with ultrasound (centre frequency: 1 MHz, peak-negative pressure: 0.35 MPa, pulse length:\n10 ms, repetition frequency: 0.5 Hz) while intravenously injecting SonoVue microbubbles and either the 1 kDa Gd(rhodamine-pip-DO3A) complex or a conventionally-used lysine-fixable Texas Red\u00ae 3 kDa dextran. The opposite right\nhemisphere was used as a non-treated control region. Brains were then extracted and either sectioned and imaged via fluorescence or confocal microscopy or imaged using a 9.4 T magnetic resonance\nimaging scanner. Brain slices were stained for neurons (NeuN), microglia (Iba1) and astrocytes (GFAP) to investigate the cellular localization of the probes.Results: Rhodamine fluorescence was detected in the left hemisphere\nof all ultrasound treated mice, while none was detected in the right control hemisphere. Cellular uptake of Gd(rhodamine-pip-DO3A) was observed in all the treated regions with a uniform distribution (coefficient\nof variation = 0.4 \u00b1 0.05). Uptake was confirmed within neurons, whereas the probe did not co-localize with microglia and astrocytes. Compared to the dextran molecule, Gd(rhodamine-pip-DO3A) distributed more homogeneously\nand was less concentrated around blood vessels. Furthermore, the dextran molecule was found to accumulate unselectively in microglia as well as neurons, whereas our probe was only taken up by\nneurons. Gd(rhodamine-pip-DO3A) was detected via magnetic resonance imaging ex vivo in similar regions to where fluorescence was detected.Conclusion: We have introduced a method to image neurons with a dual-modal imaging\nagent delivered non-invasively and locally to the brain using focused ultrasound and microbubbles. When delivered to the mouse brain, the agent distributed homogeneously and was only uptaken by neurons; in\ncontrast, conventionally used dextran distributed heterogeneously and was uptaken by microglia as well as neurons. This result indicates that our probe labels neurons without microglial involvement and in addition the\nprobe was found to be detectable via both ex vivo MRI and fluorescence. Labeling neurons with such dual-modal agents could facilitate the study of neuronal morphology and physiology using the\nadvantages of both imaging modalities.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32194827", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32028624", "Title": "Experimental Identification of Statistical Correlation between Mechanical Properties of FRP Composite.", "JournalName": "Materials", "Date Added": "20200203", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "Recent prediction on the heavy statistical correlation between the mechanical properties of fiber reinforced composite (FRP) raises new concerns on the accurate reliability evaluation of composite structures, but such statistical\ncorrelation still lacks experimental verification.

The measured vibration perception thresholds (VPTs), however,\nare subjective and usually result in a large data variability. This might induce difficulties to detect differences, for example, when comparing different anatomical locations. Hence, a higher ability to detect\nchanges is desirable. Another feature of VPTs is spatial summation, but in the literature it is controversially discussed whether or not this phenomenon is also present in the lower frequency\nrange. For these reasons, the present study aimed to investigate whether an enlarged matrix contactor area (measured at the hairy skin) induces improvements in subjective sensitivity using high and low\nfrequencies, and whether a large contactor area is better able to identify changes of VPTs than a small contactor area of a single contactor. For each frequency, we hypothesized an\nincreased sensitivity for the matrix compared to the single contactor. We also hypothesized that changes can be better-detected between the anatomical locations when using the matrix than the single contactor.\nMethods: Twenty healthy and young participants voluntarily took part in this study. Three anatomical locations at the torso were measured at the middle aspect of the lower back, middle lateral\naspect of the upper arm, and the region just below the armpit. At each location, two frequencies (30, 200 Hz) and two contactor conditions (single contactor: 0.48 cm2 , contactor\nmatrix: 9 \u00d7 0.48 cm2 = 4.32 cm2) were tested in a randomized order. Results: Supporting our hypothesis, we found that improved cutaneous sensitivity after increasing the contactor size occurs\nnot only at high, but also at low frequencies at all anatomical locations. Large contactor sizes resulted in higher sensitivity and in a superior ability to detect changes. The superior\nbehavior of the matrix to exhibit a lower variability could not always be proven.

Previous studies have demonstrated that PBD-2 can kill various bacteria, regulate host immune\nresponses and promote growth of piglets. However, the antiviral role of PBD-2 is rarely investigated. This study aimed to reveal the antiviral ability of PBD-2 against pseudorabies virus (PRV), the\ncausative pathogen of Aujeszky\u2019s disease, in PK-15 cells and in a PBD-2 expressing transgenic (TG) mouse model. Methods: In this study, the cytotoxicity of PBD-2 on PK-15 cells was measured\nby CCK-8 assay. PK-15 cells were incubated with PRV pre-treated with different concentrations of PBD-2 and PRV titers in cell culture supernatants were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). TG\nmice and wild-type (WT) mice were intraperitoneally injected with PRV and the survival rate was recorded for 10\u2009days.

Results: PBD-2 at a maximum concentration of 80\u2009\u03bcg/mL displayed no significant cytotoxicity on PK-15\ncells. A threshold concentration of PBD-2 at 40\u2009\u03bcg/mL was required to inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells. The survival rate in PBD-2 TG mice was 50% higher than that of\nWT mice. In addition, TG mice showed alleviated tissue lesions in brain, spleen and liver compared with their WT littermates after PRV challenge, while viral loads of PRV in brain,\nliver and lung of TG mice were significantly lower than that of WT mice. Conclusions: PBD-2 could inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells and protect mice from PRV infection, which\nconfirmed the antiviral ability of PBD-2 both in vitro and in vivo.

Early reproduction should especially trade-off against late reproduction and\nlongevity because of reduced investment into somatic protection, including immunity. Moreover, as optimal reproductive strategies of males and females differ, sexually dimorphic patterns of senescence may evolve. In particular, as\nmales gain fitness through mating success, sexual competition should be a major factor accelerating male senescence. In a single experiment, we examined these possibilities by establishing artificial populations of the\nmealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, in which we manipulated the sex-ratio to generate variable levels of investment into reproductive effort and sexual competition in males and females. Results: As predicted, variation\nin sex-ratio affected male and female reproductive efforts, with contrasted sex-specific trade-offs between lifetime reproduction, survival and immunity. High effort of reproduction accelerated mortality in females, without affecting immunity, but\nhigh early reproductive success was observed only in balanced sex-ratio condition. Male reproduction was costly on longevity and immunity, mainly because of their investment into copulations rather than in sexual\ncompetition.

Initiating and controlling movement can be difficult for people with Parkinson\u2019s (PWP), but\nstudies have not identified whether PWP differ from controls in SMT. For community-based interventions, e.g. dancing, it would be helpful to know a baseline SMT to optimize the tempi of\ncued activities. Therefore, this study compared finger tapping (FT), toe tapping (TT) and stepping \u2018on the spot\u2019 (SS) in PWP and two groups of healthy controls [age-matched controls (AMC) and\nyoung healthy controls (YHC)], as SMT is known to change with age. Methods: Participants (PWP; n = 30, AMC; n = 23, YHC; n = 35) were asked to tap\nor step on the spot at a natural pace for two trials lasting 40 seconds. The central 30 seconds were averaged for analyses using mean inter-onset intervals (IOI) and coefficient\nof variation (CoV) to measure rate and variability respectively. Results: PWP had faster SMT than both control groups, depending on the movement modality: FT, F(2, 87) = 7.92, p <\n0.01 (PWP faster than YHC); TT, F(2, 87) = 4.89, p = 0.01 (PWP faster than AMC); and SS, F(2, 77) = 3.26, p = 0.04 (PWP faster than AMC).\nPWP had higher CoV (more variable tapping) than AMC in FT only, F(2, 87) = 4.10, p = 0.02.

The last decade, ROH analyses have\nbecome the state-of-the-art method for inbreeding assessment. In PLINK, the --homozyg function is used to perform ROH analyses and relies on several input settings. These settings can have a large\nimpact on the outcome and default values are not always appropriate for medium density SNP array data. Guidelines for a robust and uniform ROH analysis in PLINK using medium density\ndata are lacking, albeit these guidelines are vital for comparing different ROH studies. In this study, 8 populations of different livestock and pet species are used to demonstrate the importance\nof PLINK input settings. Moreover, the effects of pruning SNPs for low minor allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium on ROH detection are shown. Results: We introduce the genome coverage parameter\nto appropriately estimate FROH and to check the validity of ROH analyses. The effect of pruning for linkage disequilibrium and low minor allele frequencies on ROH analyses is highly population\ndependent and such pruning may result in missed ROH. PLINK\u2019s minimal density requirement is crucial for medium density genotypes and if set too low, genome coverage of the ROH analysis\nis limited. Finally, we provide recommendations for the maximal gap, scanning window length and threshold settings.

The mechanism of organ tropism and innate\nimmune evasion of DPV has not been completely deciphered due to a lack of cell models to study the innate immune manipulation and pathogenicity of aquatic viruses. In the present\nstudy, we isolated five types of duck primary cells [duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs), neurons, astrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and monocytes/macrophages] to identify appropriate cell models for DPV, using\ntropism infection and innate immunologic assays. Cells responded differently to stimulation with DNA viruses or RNA virus analogs. DPV infection exhibited broad tropism, as the recombinant virulent strain (CHv-GFP) infected\nDEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, but not the PBMCs, as the expression of EGFP was negligible. The basal levels of innate immunity molecules were highest in monocytes/macrophages and lower in\nDEFs and astrocytes. Conversely, the titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain was higher in DEFs and astrocytes than in neurons and monocytes/macrophages. The titer and genomic\ncopy number of the attenuated virus strain were higher compared with the virulent strain in DEFs, neurons, and astrocytes. The innate immune response was not significantly induced by either DPV\nstrain in DEFs, neurons, or astrocytes. The virulent strain persistently infected monocytes/macrophages, but the attenuated strain did so abortively, and this was accompanied by the phenomenon of innate immune inhibition\nand activation by the virulent and attenuated strains, respectively. Blockage of IFNAR signaling promoted replication of the attenuated strain. Pre-activation of IFNAR signaling inhibited infection by the virulent strain. The\nselection assay results indicated that induction of innate immunity plays an essential role in controlling DPV infection, and monocytes/macrophages are an important cell model for further investigations.

This study aims to assess the diabetes self-care behaviours of patients attending two tertiary hospitals in Gauteng, South Africa. The\nstudy also seeks to estimate the inequalities in adherence to diabetes self-care practices and associated factors. Methods: A unique health-facilities based cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst diabetes patients in 2017.\nOur study sample included 396 people living with diabetes. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Diabetes self-management practices considered in this study are dietary diversity, medication adherence, physical\nactivity, self-monitoring of blood-glucose, avoiding smoking and limited alcohol consumption. Concentration indices (CIs) were used to estimate inequalities in adherence to diabetes self-care practices. Multiple logistic regressions were fitted to\ndetermine factors associated with diabetes self-care practices. Results: Approximately 99% of the sample did not consume alcohol or consumed alcohol moderately, 92% adhered to self-monitoring of blood-glucose, 85% did not\nsmoke tobacco, 67% adhered to their medication, 62% had a diverse diet and 9% adhered to physical activity.

HEV-protease\nregion encoding 432\u2013592 amino acids of Genotype-1 was amplified, expressed in Sf21 cells and purified in its native form. The recombinant enzyme was biochemically characterized using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and\nImmunofluorescence. The enzyme activity and the inhibition studies were conducted using Zymography, FTC-casein based protease assay and ORF1 polyprotein digestion. To conduct ORF1 digestion assay, the polyprotein, natural substrate of\nHEV-protease, was expressed in E. coli and purified. Cleavage of 186 kDa ORF1 polyprotein by the recombinant HEV-protease lead to appearance of non-structural proteins viz. Methyltransferase, Protease, Helicase and RNA\ndependent RNA polymerase which were confirmed through immunoblotting using antibodies generated against specific epitopes of the enzymes. FTC-casein substrate was used for kinetic studies to determine Km and Vmax of\nthe enzyme and also the effect of different metal ions and other protease inhibitors. A 95% inhibition was observed with E-64 which was validated through in silico analysis. The correlation\ncoefficient between inhibition and docking score of Inhibitors was found to have a significant value of r2 = 0.75. The predicted 3D model showed two domain architecture structures similar to\nPapain like cysteine protease though they differed in arrangements of alpha helices and beta sheets.

In this study, we found\nthat TGEV infection severely disrupted intestinal homeostasis via inhibition of self-renewal and differentiation in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Profoundly, TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex-mediated the inactivation of Notch signaling provided\na mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Initial invasions by TGEV-targeted Paneth cells through aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor, then inducing mitochondrial damage and ROS generation in them, ultimately causing Paneth cell\ndecrease and loss of Notch factors (DII4 and Hes5), which are essential for Lgr5 ISCs self-renewal and differentiation.

Methods: We developed a new method of reflecting spatial effects within the concentration index using a spatial weight matrix. Spatial autocorrelation is presented using a spatial lag model.\nWe use data from the Malawi Demographic Health Survey (n\u00a0=\u200924,562) to illustrate the new methodology.

One of the most important measures of the effectiveness and reliability\nof GP in plant breeding is predictive accuracy. An accurate estimate of this measure is thus central to GP. Moreover, regression models are the models of choice for analyzing field\ntrial data in plant breeding. However, models that use the classical likelihood typically perform poorly, often resulting in biased parameter estimates, when their underlying assumptions are violated. This typically happens\nwhen data are contaminated with outliers. These biases often translate into inaccurate estimates of heritability and predictive accuracy, compromising the performance of GP. Since phenotypic data are susceptible to contamination,\nimproving the methods for estimating heritability and predictive accuracy can enhance the performance of GP. Robust statistical methods provide an intuitively appealing and a theoretically well justified framework for overcoming\nsome of the drawbacks of classical regression, most notably the departure from the normality assumption. We compare the performance of robust and classical approaches to two recently published methods for\nestimating heritability and predictive accuracy of GP using simulation of several plausible scenarios of random and block data contamination with outliers and commercial maize and rye breeding datasets. Results: The\nrobust approach generally performed as good as or better than the classical approach in phenotypic data analysis and in estimating the predictive accuracy of heritability and genomic prediction under both\nthe random and block contamination scenarios. Notably, it consistently outperformed the classical approach under the random contamination scenario. Analyses of the empirical maize and rye datasets further reinforce the stability\nand reliability of the robust approach in the presence of outliers or missing data. Conclusions: The proposed robust approach enhances the predictive accuracy of heritability and genomic prediction by minimizing\nthe deleterious effects of outliers for a broad range of simulation scenarios and empirical breeding datasets. Accordingly, plant breeders should seriously consider regularly using the robust alongside the classical approach\nand increasing the number of replicates to three or more, to further enhance the accuracy of the robust approach.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937245", "Tag": "COVID Case Control Treatment"}, {"PMID": "31932713", "Title": "Metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer enrichment for viral diagnostics and genomic surveillance.", "JournalName": "Nature Microbiology", "Date Added": "20200113", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), the shotgun sequencing of RNA and DNA from clinical samples, has proved useful for broad-spectrum pathogen detection and the genomic surveillance of viral outbreaks.

While virus-host interactions are promising targets for antivirals, there is only limited knowledge regarding the interactions of EBOV\nwith cellular host factors. Recently, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen that identified the nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) as an important host factor for the EBOV life cycle.\nNXF1 is a major component of the nuclear mRNA export pathway that is usurped by many viruses whose life cycles include nuclear stages. However, the role of NXF1 in the\nlife cycle of EBOV, a virus replicating in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, remains unknown. In order to better understand the role of NXF1 in the EBOV life cycle, we performed a\ncombination of co-immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescence assays to characterize the interactions of NXF1 with viral proteins and RNAs. Additionally, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of NXF1 together with functional assays, we analyzed\nthe role of NXF1 in individual aspects of the virus life cycle. With this approach we identified the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) as a viral interaction partner of NXF1. Further studies\nrevealed that NP interacts with the RNA-binding domain of NXF1 and competes with RNA for this interaction. Co-localization studies showed that RNA binding-deficient, but not wildtype NXF1, accumulates in NP-derived\ninclusion bodies, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that NXF1 is necessary for viral protein expression, but not for viral RNA synthesis. Finally, our results showed that NXF1 interacts with viral mRNAs,\nbut not with viral genomic RNAs. Based on these results we suggest a model whereby NXF1 is recruited into inclusion bodies to promote the export of viral mRNA:NXF1 complexes from\nthese sites. This would represent a novel function for NXF1 in the life cycle of cytoplasmically replicating viruses, and may provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches against EBOV, and\npossibly other emerging viruses.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31940815", "Tag": "COVID Case Control Treatment"}, {"PMID": "31923349", "Title": "Strengthening timely detection and reporting of unusual respiratory events from health facilities in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon.", "JournalName": "Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses", "Date Added": "20200110", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "Background: The International Health Regulations state that early detection and immediate reporting of unusual health events is important for early warning and response systems.

However, few natural models exist that can simultaneously represent mtDNA transmission bias, mutation,\nand copy number variation. Certain isolates of the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae harbor large, naturally-occurring mtDNA deletions of several hundred basepairs affecting the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nduo-5) gene that can\nbe functionally detrimental. These deletion variants can behave as selfish DNA elements under genetic drift conditions, but whether all of these large deletion variants are transmitted in the same preferential\nmanner remains unclear. In addition, the degree to which transgenerational mtDNA evolution profiles are shared between isolates that differ in their propensity to accumulate the nduo-5 deletion is also unclear.\nWe address these knowledge gaps by experimentally bottlenecking two isolates of C. briggsae with different nduo-5 deletion frequencies for up to 50 generations and performing total DNA sequencing to identify\nmtDNA variation. We observed multiple mutation profile differences and similarities between C. briggsae isolates, a potentially species-specific pattern of copy number dysregulation, and some evidence for genetic hitchhiking in the\ndeletion-bearing isolate.

A thermal and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) in tension and compression modes within the ranges 1 to 20 Hz and 30 \u00b0C to 250 \u00b0C\nwas performed on human nasal cartilage.

Three peaks at 60\u201380 \u00b0C, 100\u2013130 \u00b0C, and 200 \u00b0C were attributed to melting of the crystalline region of collagen\nmatrix, water evaporation, and the strongly bound non-interstitial water in the cartilage and composite specimens, respectively.

Finding out the potential of biomarkers to differentiate between viral and bacterial pneumonia is also important because knowing the exact pathogen would prevent irrational use\nof antibiotics. At present, irrational, broad-spectrum antibiotic use and increasing antibiotic resistance in microorganisms are still one of the greatest challenges in clinical settings.

Protein sequences are accumulating to an increasing degree such that abundant sequences to construct an MSA of a target protein are readily obtainable. Nevertheless, many cases present different ends\nof the number of sequences that can be included in an MSA used for contact prediction. The abundant sequences might degrade prediction results, but opportunities remain for a limited number\nof sequences to construct an MSA. To resolve these persistent issues, we strove to develop a novel framework using DNNs in an end-to-end manner for contact prediction. Results: We developed\nneural network models to improve precision of both deep and shallow MSAs. Results show that higher prediction accuracy was achieved by assigning weights to sequences in a deep MSA. Moreover,\nfor shallow MSAs, adding a few sequential features was useful to increase the prediction accuracy of long-range contacts in our model. Based on these models, we expanded our model to\na multi-task model to achieve higher accuracy by incorporating predictions of secondary structures and solvent-accessible surface areas. Moreover, we demonstrated that ensemble averaging of our models can raise accuracy. Using\npast CASP target protein domains, we tested our models and demonstrated that our final model is superior to or equivalent to existing meta-predictors.

Bats are important reservoirs for adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in Western Europe to evaluate the association\nbetween characteristic traits of bat species and their probability of hosting adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of\nadenoviruses and mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of adenoviruses across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could hinder transmission\nof adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of\nadenoviruses was reported for the Iberian species Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii and Nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter, males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses\nthan females, due to the immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season.

The\nlatter is a frequent disease of dairy industry with staggering economical losses upon decreased milk production and increased health care costs. Early stage diagnosis of the associated diseases or inflammation\nonset is almost impossible by conventional analytical manners. Results: The present study demonstrates a simple, rapid, and cost-effective label-free chemiluminescence bioassay based on magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) for sensitive detection of\nhaptoglobin by employing the specific interaction of hemoglobin-modified MNPs. The resulting haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex inhibits the peroxidase-like activity of luminol/H2O2-hemoglobin-MNPs sensing scheme and reduces the chemiluminescence intensities correspondingly to the innate\nhaptoglobin concentrations. Quantitative detection of bovine haptoglobin was obtained within the range of 1\u00a0pg\u00a0mL\u22121 to 1\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0mL\u22121, while presenting 0.89\u00a0pg\u00a0mL\u22121 limit of detection.

The presented bioassay quantitative performances correspond with a\nstandardized assay kit in differentiating dissimilar milk qualities.

Cytological observation showed that both the stem and leaf of Z. brachypterum were significantly thicker\nthan those of Z. fabago.

However, neuromuscular mechanisms underlying the benefits of tai chi for persons with KOA are not clearly understood. Postural control deficits in performing a\nprimary motor task may be more pronounced when required to simultaneously attend to a cognitive task. This single-blind, parallel design randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the effects of\na 12-week tai chi programme versus balance and postural control training on neuromechanical characteristics during dual-task stair negotiation. Methods and analysis: Sixty-six participants with KOA will be randomised into either\ntai chi or balance and postural control training, each at 60\u2009min per session, twice weekly for 12 weeks. Assessed at baseline and 12 weeks (ie, postintervention), the primary outcomes are\nattention cost and dynamic postural stability during dual-task stair negotiation. Secondary outcomes include balance and proprioception, foot clearances, self-reported symptoms and function. A telephone follow-up to assess symptoms and function\nwill be conducted at 20 weeks. The findings will help determine whether tai chi is beneficial on dynamic stability and in reducing fall risks in older adults with KOA patients\nin community.

It is generally assumed that methanotrophic bacteria are mostly active at the oxic\u2010anoxic transition zone in stratified lakes,\nwhere they use oxygen to oxidize methane.

The magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), multi-echo MPRAGE (MEMPRAGE) and magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echo\n(MP2RAGE) sequences have all been used to acquire brain structural images, but it is unclear which of these sequences is the most suitable for brain morphometry and whether the number\nof coil channels (20 or 32) affects scan precision. This study aimed to assess the impact of T1-weighted image acquisition variables (sequence and head coil) on the repeatability of resultant\nautomated volumetric measurements. Methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers underwent back-to-back scanning protocols with three sequences and two different coils (i.e., six scanning conditions in total) presented in a randomized order in\na single session. MorphoBox prototype and FreeSurfer were used for brain segmentation. Brain structures were divided into cortical and subcortical regions for more precise analysis. The acquired volume and thickness\nvalues were used to calculate test-retest variability (TRV) values. TRV values from the six different combinations were compared for total brain structures, total cortical structures, total subcortical structures, and every\nsingle structure. Results: The median TRV value for all brain regions was 1.23% with MorphoBox and 3.14% with FreeSurfer. When using FreeSurfer results to compare the six combinations, for total\nbrain structures volume and total cortical structures volume and thickness, the MEMPRAGE-32 channel combination showed significantly lower TRV values than the others (P<0.01).

Recent improvements of techniques that localize\nsingle RNA molecules in tissues like single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescence amplification methods have given a considerable boost in the knowledge of the lncRNA functions.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).\nThe classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2-Ang1-7-MasR counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans. ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs,\nand testes. ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses the\nACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells. ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury. Current research shows\nthat the poor prognosis of patients with COVID-19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (higher than 60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS,\nand other relevant factors. Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein-based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become\none of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the future.

As hospitals work to acquire enough personal protective equipment and brace for potential cases, the\nrole of infection prevention efforts and programs has become increasingly important. Lessons from the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in Toronto and 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea have unveiled the critical\nrole that hospitals play in outbreaks, especially of novel coronaviruses. Their ability to amplify the spread of disease can rapidly fuel transmission of the disease and often those failures in\ninfection prevention and general hospital practices contribute to such events. While efforts to enhance infection prevention measures and hospital readiness are underway in the United States, it is important to\nunderstand why these programs were not able to maintain continued, sustainable levels of readiness. History has shown that infection prevention programs are primarily responsible for preparing hospitals and responding to\nbiological events but face under-staffing and focused efforts defined by administrators. The current U.S. healthcare system though, is built upon a series of priorities that often view biopreparedness as a\ncostly endeavor. Awareness of these competing priorities and the challenges infection prevention programs face when working to maintain biopreparedness is critical in adequately addressing this critical infrastructure in the face\nof an international outbreak.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32223774", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32227090", "Title": "The ACE2 expression in human heart indicates new potential mechanism of heart injury among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.", "JournalName": "Cardiovascular research", "Date Added": "20200330", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 30", "Abstract": "A new type of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks recently in China and spreads into many other countries.

METHODS: 54 cases of SARS-Cov-2 infected medical staff from Tongji Hospital between January 7th to February 11th of 2020 were analyzed\nin this retrospective study. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method. RESULTS: From January 7 to February 11, 2020, 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital\nwere hospitalized due to COVID-19. Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%). Among the 54 COVID-19 patients, the\ndistribution of age had a significant difference between non-severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs. 38 years, p=0.0015).

For acute respiratory infection, RT-PCR is routinely used to detect causative viruses in\nrespiratory secretions. Coronavirus RNA can be detected from nose and throat swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood and feces. Such specimens were examined by RT-PCR. Three targets,\nRdRP, E and N genes were detected, indicating samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2]. After patient recovery, a chest CT examination, combined with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, confirmed diagnosis. However, some recovery\npatients with negative RNA tests turned RNA positive. The preliminary data is about 14% of discharged patients in Guangdong reported by the Guangdong Center for Disease Control (CDC). This is\nan important scientific issue. If samples are positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, patients should be managed according to infection source. Fortunately, there were no close contacts of second-generation cases. We herein\nreport six SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed in our hospital, for the changes of results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA should attract attention. Most patients were elderly, with a low Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index\n(GNRI). However, the association of the phenomenon with aging and GNRI has not yet been reported in detail. Further investigations are necessary to confirm and improve these findings. Similarly, discharged\npatient follow-up should be strengthened. This article is protected by copyright.

This study aims to assess correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution and CT scores as based on findings\nfrom sequential chest CT examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis underwent chest CT examinations. Five patients who did not\nhave positive CT findings or who had not yet fulfilled criteria for discharge from the hospital were excluded. CT scores were determined according to CT findings and lung involvement. The\ntime from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment was recorded for each patient, and on the basis of this information, patients with COVID-19 were divided into group 1 (patients for\nwhom this interval was </= 3 days) and group 2 (those for whom this interval was > 3 days). The CT scores for each group were fitted using a Lorentzian\nline-shape curve to show the variation tendency during treatment. The differences in age, sex, and last CT scores determined before discharge between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations of\nthe time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution as well as with the highest CT score also underwent statistical analysis. RESULTS. A total\nof 25 subjects were enrolled in the study. The fitted tendency curves for group 1 and group 2 were significantly different, with peak points showing that the estimated highest CT\nscore was 10 and 16 for each group, respectively, and the time to disease resolution was 6 and 13 days, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test showed that the last CT scores\nwere lower for group 1 than for group 2 (p = 0.025), although the chi-square test found no difference in age and sex between the groups. The time from symptom\nonset to diagnosis and treatment had a positive correlation with the time to disease resolution (r = 0.93; p = 0.000) as well as with the highest CT score (r\n= 0.83; p = 0.006).

AIMS: To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID-19 and discuss the possibility\nof faecal transmission METHODS: We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID-19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since\nthe outbreak. RESULTS: With an incidence of 3%(1/41)-79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 included anorexia 39.9%(55/138)-50.2%(101/201), diarrhoea 2%(2/99)-49.5%(146/295), vomiting 3.6%(5/138)-66.7%(4/6), nausea 1%(1/99)-29.4%(59/201), abdominal pain 2.2%(3/138)-6.0%(12/201), and gastrointestinal bleeding 4%(2/52)-13.7%(10/73). Diarrhoea\nwas the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 +/- 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent\nin children. 3.6%(5/138)-15.9%(32/201) of adult patients presented vomiting and 6.5%(2/31)-66.7%(4/6) of children. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of\ndigestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of\npatients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in non-severe patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3%\nvs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms were similar in severe and non-severe cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs\n4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). ACE2 receptor and virus nucleocapsid protein was detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as\naccurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection. About 36%(5/14)-53%(39/73) faecal PCR becomes positive, 2-5 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23%(17/73)-82%(54/66) patients for 1-11\ndays. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic.

FCoV is incredibly contagious and transmission is via the faecal-oral route. FCoV infection, and therefore FIP, is\nmost common in breeder and rescue catteries, where many cats are kept indoors, using litter trays. Whether it is possible to break the cycle of FCoV infection and reinfection using\ncat litters has never been investigated. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of cat litters on FCoV infectivity and virus load in multi-cat households, and transmission\nfrequency. METHODS: Fifteen cat litters were mixed and incubated with FCoV, centrifuged and the supernatants tested in vitro for the ability to prevent virus infection of cell culture. To test\napplicability of in vitro results to real life, virus load was measured in two households in a double crossover study of four Fuller's earth-based cat litters by testing rectal swabs\nusing FCoV reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Four litters abrogated FCoV infection of cell culture, nine reduced it to a greater or lesser extent and two had no effect. One\nbrand had different virus inhibitory properties depending on where it was manufactured. Fuller's earth-based litters performed best, presumably by adsorbing virus. In the field study, there appeared to be less\nvirus shedding on one Fuller's earth-based cat litter. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The in vitro study successfully identified cat litters that inactivate FCoV; such litters exist so do not need to\nbe developed. Fuller's earth-based litters best prevented infection of cell culture, but did not completely abrogate FCoV transmission in two multi-cat households. A dust-free clumping Fuller's earth litter appeared to\nfare best, but virus shedding also varied on the control litters, complicating interpretation. Sawdust-based cat litters are not useful in FCoV-endemic households because they track badly and have a poor\neffect on virus infection.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094626", "Tag": "COVID Treatment Default"}, {"PMID": "32221904", "Title": "Fortbildung in Zeiten von COVID-19.", "JournalName": "Mmw Fortschritte Der Medizin", "Date Added": "20200330", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32221904", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32221883", "Title": "In diesen F\u00e4llen kann nun telefonisch eine AU ausgestellt werden.", "JournalName": "Mmw Fortschritte Der Medizin", "Date Added": "20200330", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32221883", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32221902", "Title": "Schon junge \u00c4rzte oft ausgebrannt: Internationaler Survey.", "JournalName": "Mmw Fortschritte Der Medizin", "Date Added": "20200330", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32221902", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32221882", "Title": "Coronavirus-Pandemie: So werden die Leistungen am Patienten verg\u00fctet: Wie Sie an das extrabudget\u00e4re Honorar kommen.", "JournalName": "Mmw Fortschritte Der Medizin", "Date Added": "20200330", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32221882", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32225176", "Title": "Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to the ACE2 receptor.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Date Added": "20200330", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 30", "Abstract": "A novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China since December 2019, and soon spread nationwide and spilled over to other\ncountries around the world(1-3).

The overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as\nthe cell receptor(4).

Here we determined the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) (engineered to\nfacilitate crystallization) in complex with hACE2. Compared with the SARS-CoV RBD, a hACE2-binding ridge in SARS-CoV-2 RBD takes a more compact conformation; moreover, several residue changes in SARS-CoV-2 RBD stabilize\ntwo virus-binding hotspots at the RBD/hACE2 interface. These structural features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhance its hACE2-binding affinity. Additionally, we show that RaTG13, a bat coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2, also\nuses hACE2 as its receptor.

Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the\ndisease. Objective: To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February\n9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations. During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well\nas results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ocular signs and symptoms\nas well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age\nwas 65.8 (16.6) years.

COVID-19 originated in\nChina and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020. For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age. This begs the question\nas to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging. Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19. One is CD26 and the\nother is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and\nQuercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity. Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase. Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and\nDoxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication. Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the\nhypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment. Thus, we propose that\nnew clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts. As\nAzithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein\nsynthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32229706", "Tag": "COVID Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32228808", "Title": "Policy Decisions and Use of Information Technology to Fight 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease, Taiwan.", "JournalName": "Emerging infectious diseases", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "Because of its proximity to and frequent travelers to and from China, Taiwan faces complex challenges in preventing 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the immune system which, if it is weak, cannot stem the infection and its symptoms. The new CoV-19\nspreads in the population at a rate of 0.8-3% more than normal flu and mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome. If CoV-19 would\nspread with a higher incidence rate (over 10%), and affect the people who live in closed communities such as islands, it would cause many more deaths. Moreover, people from the\npoorest classes are most at risk because of lack of health care and should be given more assistance by the competent authorities. To avoid the aggravation of CoV-19 infection, and\nthe collapse of the health system, individuals should remain at home in quarantine for a period of approximately one month in order to limit viral transmission. In the case of\na pandemic, the severe shortage of respirators and protective clothing, due to the enormous demand and insufficient production, could lead the CoV-19 to kill a large number of individuals. At\npresent, there is no drug capable of treating CoV-19 flu, the only therapeutic remedies are those aimed at the side effects caused by the virus, such as inflammation and pulmonary\nfibrosis, recognized as the first causes of death. One of the COVID-19 treatments involves inhaling a mixture of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, obtaining better results than with oxygen alone. It\nwas also noted that individuals vaccinated for viral and/or bacterial infectious diseases were less likely to become infected. In addition, germicidal UV radiation \"breaks down\" the oxygen O2 which then\naggregate into O3 (ozone) molecules creating the ozone layer, capable of inhibiting viral replication and improving lung respiration. All these precautions should be taken into consideration to lower the risk\nof infection by CoV-19. New anti-viral therapies with new drugs should also be taken into consideration. For example, microbes are known to bind TLR, inducing IL-1, a pleiotropic cytokine, highly\ninflammatory, mediator of fever and fibrosis. Therefore, drugs that suppress IL-1 or IL-1R, also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are to be taken into consideration to treat COVID-19.\nWe strongly believe that all these devices described above can lead to greater survival and. therefore, reduction in mortality in patients infected with CoV-19.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228825", "Tag": "COVID Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32232980", "Title": "COVID-19 epidemic: disease characteristics in children.", "JournalName": "Journal of medical virology", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "In mid-December 2019, a disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which began in Wuhan, China, has spread throughout the country and many countries around the\nworld.

By the end of follow-up date (Mar. 3, 2020), there\nwere 16 non-severe cases (64%) and 9 severe cases (36%), 5 cases were dead (20%). Nineteen (76%) of the infected cases were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, the rest\nwere clinically diagnosed as suspected Covid-19 cases, and 19 (76%) of the infected cases had positive exposure history. We found that COPD was significantly associated with severity and death (P=0.040,\nand P=0.038, respectively), and chest operation was significantly associated with death for Covid-19 patients (P=0.039). A potential \"super spreader\" may be the source of the transmission before the implementation of\nquarantine and comprehensive protection. It was concluded that Covid-19 is associated with poor prognosis for patients undergoing thoracic operation, especially for those with COPD.

San Raffaele Scientific Institute - a large tertiary hospital and research centre in Milan, Italy - was immediately\ninvolved in the management of the public health emergency. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the elective surgical activity of the hospital was rapidly reduced and large areas of the\nhospital were simultaneously reorganised to admit and assist patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, the hospital became the regional referral hub for cardiovascular emergencies in order to keep\nensuring a high level of health care to non-COVID-19 patients in northern Italy. In a few days, a COVID-19 emergency department was created, improving the general ward capacity to a\ntotal number of 279 beds dedicated to patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds was increased from 28 to 72 (54 of them dedicated to\npatients with COVID-19, and 18 to cardiology and cardiac surgery hub emergencies), both converting pre-existing areas and creating new high technology spaces.

Heart and circulatory physiology", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "The novel SARS coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be particularly deleterious to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD). The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to\nthe membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. Recognition that ACE2 is the co-receptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic\napproaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. ACE2,\nhowever, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades Ang II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7) which antagonizes the effects\nof Ang II. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins enhance ACE2 that, in part, contribute to\nthe benefit of these regimens. In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns\nhave developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related\npathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease. The current perspective critically examines the evidence for ACE2 regulation by RAAS blockade and statins, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE2, and whether\nACE2 blockade is a viable approach to attenuate COVID-19.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228252", "Tag": "COVID Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32232979", "Title": "Analysis of heart injury laboratory parameters in 273 COVID-19 patients in one hospital in Wuhan, China.", "JournalName": "Journal of medical virology", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spreads rapidly worldwide.

The obtained data was pooled into a meta-analysis to calculate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Hypertension was associated with a nearly 2.5-fold significantly increased\nrisk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR: 2.49 [95%CI: 1.98-3.12] I2=24%), as well as with a similarly significant higher risk of mortality (OR: 2.42 [95%CI: 1.51-3.90] I2=0%).

This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients. METHODS: One hundred sixteen COVID-19-confirmed patients\nenrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data,\nmedical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was detected by\nreal-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Twelve (10.8%) patients showed mild increase of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine (<26 mumol/L within 48 h), and 8 (7.2%) patients showed trace or\n1+ albuminuria in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). All these patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria of AKI. In addition, 5 patients with CKD who were\nundergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before admission were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed as COVID-19. In addition to therapy for COVID-19, CRRT was also applied 3 times\nweekly during hospitalization for these 5 patients with CKD. In the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable state in all 5 patients with CKD, without exacerbation of\nCKD, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CKD were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without\nCKD, and 1 patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab from 5 cases with CKD.

The limited data\navailable indicates that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, geros \"old man\" and epilavis, \"harmful\") infection because the infection rates, severity, and lethality are substantially higher\nin the population aged 60 and older. This is primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of\nfunction, fitness, and increased frailty associated with aging. Immunosenescence is a major factor affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of infectious diseases. While vaccination reduces infection\nrates, and therapeutic interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these interventions have limitations. Previous studies showed that postulated geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog\neverolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients. This article presents a review of the limited literature available on geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be\ninvestigated to decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections.

Presence of Proteobacteria such as Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus amongst others, were associated with exacerbation events (OR > 0.17; P < 0.02) but more strongly associated with exacerbation frequency\n(OR > 0.39; P < 4E-10), as confirmed by longitudinal variations and biotyping of the bacterial microbiota, and suggesting a role of the microbiota in sensitizing the lung. CONCLUSIONS: This\nstudy highlights bacterial taxa in lung sensitization and viral triggers in COPD exacerbations. It provides a global overview of the diverse targets for drug development and explores new microbiome analysis\nmethods to guide future patient management applications.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228581", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32228369", "Title": "Challenges and Potential Solutions of Stroke Care During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak.", "JournalName": "Stroke", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228369", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32228364", "Title": "Radiology Department Preparedness for COVID-19: Facing an Unexpected Outbreak of the Disease.", "JournalName": "Radiology", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228364", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32228363", "Title": "COVID-19-associated Acute Hemorrhagic Necrotizing Encephalopathy: CT and MRI Features.", "JournalName": "Radiology", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228363", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32228362", "Title": "3D CT of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia.", "JournalName": "Radiology", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "This article has online supplemental material.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228362", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32228332", "Title": "COVID-19 and the Urology Match: Perspectives and a Call to Action.", "JournalName": "The Journal of urology", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228332", "Tag": "COVID"}, {"PMID": "32228322", "Title": "COVID-19 Pandemic, Corona Viruses, and Diabetes Mellitus.", "JournalName": "American journal of physiology.

We provide a practical strategy to reorganize pathways of emergency and elective colorectal surgery during the COVID-19\npandemic. METHOD: The authors, all from areas affected by the COVID-19 emergency, brainstormed remotely to define the key-points to be discussed. Tasks were assigned, concerning specific aspects of colorectal surgery\nduring the pandemic, including the administrative management of the crisis in Italy. The recommendations (based on experience and on the limited evidence available) were collated and summarized. RESULTS: Little is\nknown about the transmission of COVID-19, but it has shown a rapid spread. It is prudent to stop non-cancer procedures and prioritize urgent cancer treatment. Endoscopy and proctological procedures should\nbe performed highly selectively. When dealing with colorectal emergencies, a conservative approach is advised. Specific procedures should be followed when operating on COVID-19-patients, using dedicated personal protective equipment and adhering\nto specific rules. Some policies are described, including minimally-invasive surgery. These policies outline the strict regulation of entry/ exit into theatres and operating building as well as advice on performing\nprocedures safely to reduce risk spreading the virus. It is likely that a reorganization of health system is required, both at central and local levels. A description of the strategy\nadopted in Italy is provided. CONCLUSION: Evidence on the management of patients needing surgery for colorectal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is currently lacking. Lessons learnt from healthcare professionals that\nhave managed high volumes of surgical patients during the pandemic could be useful to mitigate some risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public and healthcare staff.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233064", "Tag": "Italy Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32233168", "Title": "Mental Health and Psychological Intervention Amid COVID-19 Outbreak: Perspectives from South Korea.", "JournalName": "Yonsei medical journal", "Date Added": "", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233168", "Tag": "Epidemiology Treatment COVID Default"}, {"PMID": "32232474", "Title": "Human challenge studies to accelerate coronavirus vaccine licensure.", "JournalName": "The Journal of infectious diseases", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "Controlled human challenge trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates could accelerate the testing and potential rollout of efficacious vaccines.

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020,\nwe provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the\noutbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating\nthe parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29.\nAs the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as\na subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number\nof confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering\nthe period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be approximately 4.6, while the one computed under\nthe second scenario was found to be approximately 3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be approximately 2.6 based on confirmed\ncases and approximately 2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed\ncases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that\non the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals\na significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine\nand hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than\nthe reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality\nratio is around approximately 0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32231374", "Tag": "Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32232322", "Title": "Disparities in Age-Specific Morbidity and Mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in China and the Republic of Korea.", "JournalName": "Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America", "Date Added": "20200331", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 31", "Abstract": "We analyzed age- and sex-specific morbidity and mortality data from SARS-COV-2 pandemic in China and Republic of Korea (ROK).

Physicians and health\ncare workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care. Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers\nwho come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations\nwas created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observations: A high number of health care\nworkers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels\nof safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each\ncategory was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations\nwere made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system.\nBased on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly\nreduced while providing high levels of care.

Mask wearing and hand washing can\nslow the spread of the virus, but currently masks are in shortage in many countries, and timely hand washing is often impossible. METHODS: The efficacy of three types of masks\nand instant hand wiping was evaluated using avian influenza virus to mock the coronavirus. Virus quantification was performed using real-time RT-PCR. Previous studies on mask wearing were reviewed. RESULTS: Instant\nhand wiping using a wet towel soaked in water containing 1.00% soap powder, 0.05% active chlorine, or 0.25% active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite removed 98.36%, 96.62%, and 99.98% of the\nvirus from hands, respectively. N95 masks, medical masks, and homemade masks made of 4-layer kitchen paper and 1-layer cloth could block 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of the virus in aerosols.\nMedical mask wearing which was supported by many studies was opposed by other studies possibly due to erroneous judgment. With these data we propose the approach of mask wearing plus\ninstant hand hygiene (MIH) to slow the exponential spread of the virus. This MIH approach has been supported by the experiences of seven countries in fighting against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A\nsimple approach to slow the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 was proposed with the support of experiments, literature review, and control experiences.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions\nof coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United\nStates and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57,\nor >/=58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or \"other\"), as well as all permutations of these strata. The\nnumber of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrollment into the survey within each\nstratum was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United\nStates and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of\nUS participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between pound15,000 and pound74,999. US and\nUK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR\n2.0%-10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to\nprevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common\nsurgical mask was \"highly effective\" in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was\nprudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at\nan especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2.

With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national approach to containment has been established\nto test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19. At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC's surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19\ninfection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory\ncases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy. METHODS: The RCGP RSC, a network of over 500\ngeneral practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly. This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed\nto COVID-19. Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this. (2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness\nor lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)-with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not\nseen in primary care. (3) Serology sample collection across all age groups. This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a\nscheduled blood test. The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance. (4) Collecting convalescent serum samples. (5) Data\ncuration. We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed. Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories. RESULTS: General practice clinical system\nproviders have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance. Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk\npatients presenting with LRTIs. Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the\nextended virology sampling. CONCLUSIONS: We have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy. The extended\nsurveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported. Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.

Perinatal period poses unique challenges and care of the\nmother-baby dyads requires special resources for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period. PROCESS: The GRADE approach recommended by the World\nHealth Organization was used to develop the guideline. A Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising of obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatricians was constituted. The GDG drafted a list of questions which are\nlikely to be faced by clinicians involved in obstetric and neonatal care. An e-survey was carried out amongst a wider group of clinicians to invite more questions and prioritize. Literature\nsearch was carried out in PubMed and websites of relevant international and national professional organizations. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, clinical trials, narrative reviews and other descriptive reports were reviewed. For\nthe practice questions, the evidence was extracted into evidence profiles. The context, resources required, values and preferences were considered for developing the recommendations. OBJECTIVES: To provide recommendations for prevention of\ntransmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period.

We analyzed the\nselective events that accompanied the divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13. To this aim, we applied a population genetics-phylogenetics approach, which leverages within-population variation and divergence from an outgroup. Results\nindicated that most sites in the viral ORFs evolved under strong to moderate purifying selection. The most constrained sequences corresponded to some non-structural proteins (nsps) and to the M protein.\nConversely, nsp1 and accessory ORFs, particularly ORF8, had a non-negligible proportion of codons evolving under very weak purifying selection or close to selective neutrality. Overall, limited evidence of positive selection\nwas detected. The 6 bona fide positively selected sites were located in the N protein, in ORF8, and in nsp1. A signal of positive selection was also detected in the\nreceptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein but most likely resulted from a recombination event that involved the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence. In line with previous data, we suggest that the\ncommon ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 encoded/encodes an RBM similar to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 itself and in some pangolin viruses. It is presently unknown whether the common ancestor\nstill exists and which animals it infects. Our data however indicate that divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13 was accompanied by limited episodes of positive selection, suggesting that the common\nancestor of the two viruses was poised for human infection.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are dangerous zoonotic pathogens: in the last two decades three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused human\nepidemics. One of these is the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. We investigated how, since its divergence from a closely related bat virus, natural selection shaped the genome of SARS-CoV-2. We found\nthat distinct coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome evolve under different degrees of constraint and are consequently more or less prone to tolerate amino acid substitutions. In practical terms, the\nlevel of constraint provides indications about which proteins/protein regions are better suited as possible targets for the development of antivirals or vaccines. We also detected limited signals of positive selection\nin three viral ORFs. However, we warn that, in the absence of knowledge about the chain of events that determined the human spill-over, these signals should not be necessarily interpreted\nas evidence of an adaptation to our species.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32238584", "Tag": "COVID Default"}, {"PMID": "32238505", "Title": "COVID-19 is catalyzing the adoption of teleneurology.", "JournalName": "Neurology", "Date Added": "20200403", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 1", "Abstract": "The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, changed the world within a matter of weeks.

SARS-COV-2 originated from Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market, with bats as the likely original hosts and\npangolins as potential intermediate hosts. The current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with SARS-COV-2. Patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection. The virus\nis mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact, and the population is generally susceptible. The epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure\nat Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic. The basic productive number (R0) at the beginning\nof the epidemic was 2.2, with an average incubation period of 5.2 days. The proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4%, the mortality rate was lower than those of SARS\nand MERS, and 96.5% of deaths occurred in Hubei Province, where the outbreak occurred first. Among them, elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate.

This paper examines the legal implications of such decisions. It\ntakes up arguments from the general discussion on prioritization in medicine. A constitutional hurdle for the application of utilitarian criteria (in particular patients' age or social role) comes from the\nprinciple that every human life is of equal value and must not be traded off against others (\"life value indifference\"). However, the limits that the Grundgesetz (German Basic Law) sets\nfor state actions do not apply directly to doctors. According to the Musterberufsordnung (professional code of conduct), doctors act based on their conscience and the requirements of medical ethics and\nhumanity. The implications of this normative standard for the prioritizing in an exceptional situation as the COVID 19 pandemic have not been sufficiently clarified. This uncertainty leads to emotional and\nmoral burdens for doctors.

Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe, and 6.1% with critical courses(3). This\nsevere presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung(2,4). By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is\nthought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control, of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003(5). However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract\nsymptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission(6-8). There is an urgent need for information on body site-specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity. Here we provide a detailed virological\nanalysis of nine cases, providing proof of active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11\nx 10(8) RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA\nconcentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat\nand lung samples from the same patient, proving independent replication. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients\n(14 days in all), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness.

Iran is one of the ten most affected countries. Search engines provide useful data from populations and\nthis data might be useful to analyze epidemics. Utilizing data mining methods on electronic resources' data might give better insight to manage the health crisis of coronavirus outbreak for each\ncountry and the world. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Iran. METHODS: The data is obtained from the Google Trend website. Linear regression and\nlong short-term memory (LSTM) models have been used to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases. All models are evaluated using 10-fold-cross validation, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was\nused as the performance metric. RESULTS: The Linear Regression model predicts the incidence with an RMSE of 7.562 +/- 6.492. The most effective factors besides previous day incidence include the\nsearches' frequency of handwashing, hand sanitizer, and antiseptic topics. The RMSE of the LSTM model was equal to 27.187.

Methods: Epidemiological investigation was conducted to collect the information of confirmed COVID-19 cases, including\ndemographic, epidemiological and clinical information. Results: As of 25 February 2020, a total of 91 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in Gansu. The epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu can\nbe divided as three different stages, i.e. imported case stage, imported-case plus indigenous case stage, and indigenous case stage. A total of 63 cases were clustered cases (69.23%), 3 cases\nwere medical staff infected with non-occupational exposure. The initial symptoms included fever (54.95%, 50/91), cough (52.75%, 48/91), or fatigue (28.57%, 26/91), the proportion of each symptom showed a decreasing trend\nalong with the three epidemic stages, but only the differences in proportions of fever (trend chi(2)=2.20, P<0.05) and fatigue (trend chi(2)=3.18, P<0.05) among the three epidemic stages were statistically significant.\nThe cases with critical severe symptoms accounted for 42.85% (6/14), 23.73% (14/59) and 16.67% (3/18), respectively, in three epidemic stages, showed a decreasing trend (H=6.45, P<0.05). Also, the incubation period\nprolonged along with the epidemic stage (F=51.65, P<0.01), but the intervals between disease onset and hospital visit (F=5.32, P<0.01), disease onset and diagnosis (F=5.25, P<0.01) became shorter along with the\nepidemic stage. Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) had decreased from 2.61 in imported case stage to 0.66 in indigenous case stage. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu was caused\nby the imported cases, and about 2/3 cases were clustered ones. No medical worker was observed to be infected by occupational exposure.

In the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019\n(COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid\nand effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but\nhave an alternative diagnosis. Methods- Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced\nconsiderations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. Results- A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and\nclinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a\nprotected code stroke. We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during\na protected code stroke.

The clinical course of the disease in children and infants is milder than in adults. It should be\nnoted that, although typical symptoms may be present in children, non-specific symptoms could be noted in the neonate. The disease is rare in the neonate, so, its suspicion in this\ngroup can help to make a quick diagnose.Case report: A 15-day-old neonate was admitted with fever, lethargy, cutaneous mottling, and respiratory distress without cough. His mother had symptoms of Novel\ncoronavirus. So Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was done for the neonate and showed to be positive. The newborn was isolated and subjected to supportive care. Antibiotic and antiviral\ntreatment was initiated.

Fragment-based\nde novo design tools have been successfully applied in the discovery of noncovalent inhibitors. Nevertheless, these tools are rarely applied in the field of covalent inhibitor de-sign. Herein, we present\na new protocol, called Cov_FB3D, which aims to the 'in silico' assembly of potential novel covalent inhibitors by identifying the active fragments in the covalently binding site of the target\nprotein. In this protocol, we propose a BA-SAMP strategy, which combines the noncovalent moiety score with the X-score as MM level, and the covalent can-didate score with the PM7 as\nQM level. The synthetic accessibility of each suggested compound could be further evaluated with machine-learning-based synthetic complexity evaluation (SCScore). An in-depth test of this protocol against the crystal structures of\n15 covalent complexes consisting of BTK-inhibitors, KRAS-inhibitors, EGFR-inhibitors, EphB1-inhibitors, MAGL-inhibitors and MAPK-inhibitors revealed that most of these inhibitors could be de novo repro-duced from the fragments by Cov_FB3D. The binding\nmodes of most generated reference poses could accurately reproduce the known binding mode of most of the reference covalent adduct in the binding site (RMSD </= 2 A). In particular,\nmost of these inhibitors were ranked in the top 2% using the BA-SAMP strategy. Notably, the novel human ALDOA inhibitor (T1) with potent inhibitory activity (0.34 +/- 0.03 muM) and\ngreater synthetic accessibility was successfully de novo designed by this protocol. The positive results confirm the abilities of Cov_FB3D protocol.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233478", "Tag": "COVID Treatment Default"}, {"PMID": "32233443", "Title": "Letter to the Editor.", "JournalName": "ACS chemical neuroscience", "Date Added": "20200403", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 1", "Abstract": "I have read with interest the article entitled Evidence of the COVID-19 Virus Targeting the CNS: Tissue Distribution, Host-Virus Interaction, and Proposed Neurotropic Mechanisms by Baig et al. 1.

We analyzed data on endemic fluorosis collected in Ningxia, a typical high-fluorine area in the north of China. Fluorosis cases were identified in 539 villages in 1981, in\n4449 villages in 2010, and in 3269 villages in 2017. These were located in 19 administrative counties. In 2017, a total of 1.07 million individuals suffered from fluorosis in Ningxia,\nwith more children suffering from dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis. Among Qingshuihe River basin disease areas, the high incidence of endemic fluorosis is in Yuanzhou District and Xiji County of\nGuyuan City. The paper holds that the genesis of the high incidence of endemic fluorosis in Qingshui River basin is mainly caused by chemical weathering, evaporation and concentration, and dissolution\nof fluorine-containing rocks around the basin, which is also closely related to the semi-arid geographical region background, basin structure, groundwater chemical characteristics, and climatic conditions of the basin. The process\nof mutual recharge and transformation between Qingshui River and shallow groundwater in the basin is intense. There is a close coupling relationship between the power of central and southern Ningxia\ndisease areas and Qingshui River watershed of excess fluorine water. Because the traditional drinking water source of the residents in the basin is shallow groundwater, the underground water is the\nmain cause of the high incidence of endemic fluorosis. The results show that Xiji County and Yuanzhou District were the areas of high incidence of endemic fluorosis which gradually decreased\nto the middle and lower reaches of Qingshui River. In space, distribution characteristics are Qingshui River source area > Qingshui River valley basin area, tributary area > trunk stream area,\nupstream area > middle reaches area> downstream area of Qingshui River.

U.S. older adults, including those aged >/=65 years and particularly those aged >/=85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes; however,\ndata describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported (5). As of March 28, 2020, U.S. states and territories have reported 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases\nto CDC, including 7,162 (5.8%) for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported. Among these 7,162 cases, 2,692\n(37.6%) patients had one or more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470 (62.4%) had none of these conditions reported. The percentage of COVID-19 patients with at least one\nunderlying health condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (358 of 457, 78%) and those requiring hospitalization without ICU admission (732 of 1,037,\n71%) than that among those who were not hospitalized (1,388 of 5,143, 27%). The most commonly reported conditions were diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. These preliminary findings\nsuggest that in the United States, persons with underlying health conditions or other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to be at a higher risk for\nsevere disease from COVID-19 than are persons without these conditions.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240123", "Tag": "Italy COVID Default"}, {"PMID": "32239446", "Title": "The Rapid Assessment and Early Warning Models for COVID-19.", "JournalName": "Virologica Sinica", "Date Added": "20200403", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 1", "Abstract": "Human beings have experienced a serious public health event as the new pneumonia (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has killed more than 3000 people in China,\nmost of them elderly or people with underlying chronic diseases or immunosuppressed states.

In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. They may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy\nor anticancer therapy and are at higher risk of developing infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection, and cancer patients commonly have multiple risk factors. Cancer patients appear to\nhave an estimated twofold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the WHO declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address\nthe impact of such a pandemic on cancer patients. This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to limited data,\nthere are no international guidelines to address the management of cancer patients in any infectious pandemic. In this review, the potential challenges associated with managing cancer patients during the COVID-19\ninfection pandemic will be addressed, with suggestions of some practical approaches.

METHODS: We searched five medical databases including two Chinese\nand three English databases for all published articles on COVID-19 since the outbreak. A random-effects model was designed, and the imaging and clinical data from all studies were collected for\nmeta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 31 articles and 46959 patients were included, including 10 English articles, 21 Chinese articles. The results of meta-analysis showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever\n(87.3%, 0.838-0.909), cough (58.1%, 0.502-0.660), dyspnea (38.3%, 0.246-0.520), muscle soreness or fatigue (35.5%, 0.253-0.456), chest distress (31.2%, -0.024-0.648). The main imaging finding were bilateral pneumonia (75.7%, 0.639-0.871), and ground glass\nopacification (69.9%, 0.602-0.796). Among the patients, the incidence of required intensive care unit (ICU) was (29.3%, 0.190-0.395), the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was (28.8%, 0.147-0.429), the multiple\norgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was (8.5%, -0.008-0.179), and and the case fatality rate of patients with COVID-19 was (6.8%, 0.044-0.093).

RESULTS: A total\nof 144 papers were identified from the search, 24 of which were included in the review. Overall, 18 studies examined the psychosocial responses of the general population towards the severe\nacute respiratory syndrome epidemic, four studies focused on the Ebola epidemic and two studies covered the H1N1 outbreak. Common themes in psychological responses included anxiety/fears, depression, anger, guilt, grief and\nloss, post-traumatic stress, and stigmatisation, but also a greater sense of empowerment and compassion towards others. Coping strategies adopted included problem-focused coping (seeking alternatives, self- and other-preservation), seeking social support,\navoidance, and positive appraisal of the situation. CONCLUSION: Amid the range of psychosocial responses seen in past infectious disease outbreaks, practical considerations for the current COVID-19 pandemic need to focus\non the individual in the context of the larger social environment, with an emphasis on raising awareness of the range of possible psychosocial responses, access to psychological help, self- care,\nempowering self-support groups and sustained engagement with updated, reliable information about the outbreak.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241071", "Tag": "COVID Treatment Default"}, {"PMID": "32242829", "Title": "One disease, different features: COVID-19 laboratory and radiological findings in three Italian patients.", "JournalName": "Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine", "Date Added": "20200404", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242829", "Tag": "COVID Default"}, {"PMID": "32242828", "Title": "Decreased \"WBC*LYM\" was observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from a fever clinic in Wuhan.", "JournalName": "Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine", "Date Added": "20200404", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242828", "Tag": "COVID Default"}, {"PMID": "32242790", "Title": "The challenges and considerations of community-based preparedness at the onset of COVID-19 outbreak in Iran, 2020.", "JournalName": "Epidemiology and infection", "Date Added": "20200404", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242790", "Tag": "COVID Epidemiology Default"}, {"PMID": "32242749", "Title": "Substituting Angiotensin-(1-7) to Prevent Lung Damage in SARSCoV2 Infection?", "JournalName": "Circulation", "Date Added": "20200404", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242749", "Tag": "COVID Default"}, {"PMID": "32242738", "Title": "Clinical Features of 85 Fatal Cases of COVID-19 from Wuhan: A Retrospective Observational Study.", "JournalName": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "Date Added": "20200404", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 3", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The global death toll from COVID-19 virus exceeds 21000. The risk factors for death were attributed to advanced age and co-morbidities, but haven't been accurately defined. OBJECTIVES: To report\nthe clinical features of 85 fatal cases with COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan. METHOD: Medical records of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 between January 9 and February 15, 2020\nwere collected. Information recorded included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, CT scans and clinical management. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 65.8\nyears and 72.9% were male. Common symptoms were fever (78 [91.8%]), shortness of breath (50 [58.8%]), fatigue (50 [58.8%]), dyspnea (60 [70.6%]). Hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease were the\nmost common comorbidities. Notably, 81.2% patients had very low eosinophil counts at admission. Complications included respiratory failure (80 [94.1%]), shock (69 [81.2%]), ARDS (63 [74.1%]), arrhythmia (51 [60%]), etc. Most\npatients received antibiotic (77 [90.6%]), antiviral (78 [91.8%]) and glucocorticoids (65 [76.5%]) treatments. 38 patients [44.7%] and 33 [38.8%] received intravenous immunoglobulin and interferon alpha2b respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this depictive\nstudy of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19, most cases were male aged over 50 years old with noncommunicable chronic diseases. The majority of the patients died of multiple organ failure.\nEarly onset of shortness of breath may be used as an observational symptom for COVID-19 exacerbations. Eosinophilopenia may indicate a poor prognosis. The combination of anti-microbial drugs did not offer\nconsiderable benefit to the outcome of this group of patients.

SETTING: 31 provinces in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: 4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable\ninfectious diseases. The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of, and deaths\nfrom, 44 notifiable infectious diseases. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and\nthere were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases\ndecreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious\ndiseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017,\nlargely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000\nin 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria.\nZoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever\ndoubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between\nregions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: China's success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable,\nwith deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare. Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of\nHIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241761", "Tag": "COVID Mortality Default Big Five"}, {"PMID": "32241756", "Title": "Fighting covid-19 outbreaks in prisons.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Date Added": "20200404", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241756", "Tag": "COVID Big Five Default"}, {"PMID": "32241328", "Title": "Limited early warnings and public attention to COVID-19 in China, January-February, 2020: a longitudinal cohort of randomly sampled Weibo users.", "JournalName": "Disaster medicine and public health preparedness", "Date Added": "20200404", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 3", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Awareness and attentiveness have implications for the acceptance and adoption of disease prevention and control measures.

Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool which may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic,\nyet contact tracing applications present with significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. OBJECTIVE: To provide an effective contact tracing smartphone application that respects user\nprivacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. METHODS: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing,\nand develop a proof-of-concept smartphone application which implements this approach. Additionally, we develop a computer simulation model which demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories\nacross multiple rates of adoption. RESULTS: Our proof-of-concept smartphone application allows users to create \"checkpoints\" for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report\na positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an application may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak. CONCLUSIONS:\nOur proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution which preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak.

Bat is the widely believed original host of SARS-CoV-2. However, its intermediate host before transmitting to human is not clear. Some studies\nproposed pangolin, snake or turtle as the intermediate hosts. ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which determines the potential host range for SARS-CoV-2. Based on the structural information of the\ncomplex of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we analyzed the affinity to S protein of the 20 key residues in ACE2 from mammal, bird, turtle and snake. Several ACE2 proteins\nfrom Primates, Bovidae, Cricetidae and Cetacea maintained the majority of key residues in ACE2 for associating with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The simulated structures indicated that ACE2 proteins from Bovidae and Cricetidae\nwere able to associate with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that nearly half of the key residues in turtle, snake and bird are changed. The simulated structures showed several key contacts\nwith SARS-CoV-2 RBD in turtle and snake ACE2 were abolished. Our study demonstrated that neither snake nor turtle was the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, which further reinforced the concept that\nthe reptiles are resistant against infection of coronavirus. Our study suggested that Bovidae and Cricetidae should be included in the screening of intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2. This article is protected\nby copyright.

The spread of COVID-19 may have several implications in organ transplant activity that physicians should be aware of. The initial\nexperience gained during the COVID-19 outbreak shows that around 10% of infected patients in Italy need intensive care management to overcome the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to the exponential\nrise of infected patients we are now facing an actual risk of saturation of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. A restriction in the number of ICU beds available for both\ndonors and transplant recipients may unfavorably influence the overall donation activity, and eventually lead to a reduced number of transplants.

Purpose To investigate CT features of patients with COVID-19 in Rome, Italy, and to compare the accuracy of CT with RT-PCR. Methods In this prospective study from March 4,\n2020, until March 19, 2020, consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were: chest CT with contrast medium performed for vascular indications, patients who\nrefused chest CT or hospitalization, and severe CT motion artifact. All patients underwent RT-PCR and chest CT. Diagnostic performance of CT was calculated using RT-PCR as reference. Chest CT features\nwere calculated in a subgroup of RT-PCR-positive and CT-positive patients. CT features of hospitalized patients and patient in home isolation were compared by using Pearson chi squared test. Results Our\nstudy population comprised 158 consecutive study participants (83 male and 75 female, mean age 57 y +/-17).

The purpose of this study was to simulate aerosolization events over a range of endoscopic procedures to gain an evidence-based aerosol risk assessment. METHODS: Aerosolization was\nsimulated in a cadaver using fluorescein solution (0.2mg/10ml) and quantified using a blue-light filter and digital image processing. Outpatient sneezing during endoscopy was simulated using an intranasal atomizer in the\npresence or absence of intact and modified surgical mask barriers. Surgical aerosolization was simulated during non-powered instrumentation, suction microdebrider, and high-speed drilling following nasal fluorescein application. RESULTS: Among the outpatient\nconditions, a simulated sneeze event generated maximal aerosol distribution at 30cm extending to 66cm. Both an intact surgical mask and a modified VENT mask (which enables endoscopy) eliminated all detectable\naerosol spread. Among the surgical conditions, cold instrumentation and microdebrider use did not generate detectable aerosols. Conversely, use of a high-speed drill produced significant aerosol contamination in all tested conditions.\nCONCLUSION: We confirm that aerosolization presents a risk to the endonasal skull base surgeon. In the outpatient setting, use of a barrier significantly reduces aerosol spread. Cold surgical instrumentation and\nmicrodebrider use pose significantly less aerosolization risk than a high-speed drill. Procedures requiring drill use should carry a special designation as an \"Aerosol Generating Surgery\" to convey this unique risk,\nand support the need for protective PPE.

Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has played an important role in patient diagnosis and management\nof COVID-19. In some circumstances, thermal inactivation at 56 degrees C has been recommended to inactivate Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before NAT. However, this procedure could theoretically\ndisrupt nucleic acid integrity of this single-stranded RNA virus and cause false negatives in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. METHODS: We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results\nof viral NAT. We examined the effects of thermal inactivation on the quantitative RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 particularly with regard to the rates of false-negative results for specimens carrying low\nviral loads. We additionally investigated the effects of different specimen types, sample preservation times and a chemical inactivation approach on NAT. RESULTS: Our work showed increased Ct values in specimens\nfrom diagnosed COVID-19 patients in RT-PCR tests after thermal incubation. Moreover, about half of the weak-positive samples (7 of 15 samples, 46.7%) were RT-PCR negative after heat inactivation in at\nleast one parallel testing. The use of guanidinium-based lysis for preservation of these specimens had a smaller impact on RT-PCR results with fewer false negatives (2 of 15 samples, 13.3%)\nand significantly less increase in Ct values than heat inactivation. CONCLUSION: Thermal inactivation adversely affected the efficiency of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Given the limited applicability associated with chemical inactivators,\nother approaches to ensure the overall protection of laboratory personnel need consideration.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246822", "Tag": "Default Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32245814", "Title": "Projecting hospital utilization during the COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States.", "JournalName": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "Date Added": "20200405", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 3", "Abstract": "In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the United States, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases.\nHospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of\nICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion\nof symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R 0 Without self-isolation, when R 0 = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require\n3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the\nnumber of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R 0 = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be\nrequired at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds\nis substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak.

PURPOSE: To compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in health\ncare workers. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL from January 1(st) 2014 to March 9(th) 2020. Update of published search conducted from January 1(st) 1990 to December 9(th) 2014. STUDY\nSELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in health care workers. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk\nof bias and the certainty of the evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four RCTs were meta-analysed adjusting for clustering. Compared to N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory\nconfirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90-1.25; I(2) =0%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95%CI 0.98-2.28; I(2) =78%; very low\ncertainty in the evidence). Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (p=0.49). LIMITATIONS: Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Low certainty evidence\nsuggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in health care workers during non-aerosol generating care.

All patients underwent thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) within 2 days after the onset of symptoms, and their images were\nviewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to their clinical records. RESULTS CT images of 6 confirmed patients were collected. Two of the 6 patients (33.3%) had bilateral lung involvements\nand 4 (66.7%) had single-lung involvement. Two cases (33.3%) had a single lesion, 2 cases (33.3%) had 2 lesions, and 2 cases (33.3%) had multiple lesions. There were 2 cases\n(33.3%) with focal subpleural distribution and 1 case (16.7%) along the bronchial vascular bundle.

In this paper we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home\nconfinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioral therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing\nchanged work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and homeschooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction.

In this retrospective multicenter study, we investigated the clinical course and outcomes of novel\ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from early cases in Republic of Korea. METHODS: All of the cases confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction were enrolled from the 1st to the\n28th patient nationwide. Clinical data were collected and analyzed for changes in clinical severity including laboratory, radiological, and virologic dynamics during the progression of illness. RESULTS: The median age was\n40 years (range, 20-73 years) and 15 (53.6%) patients were male. The most common symptoms were cough (28.6%) and sore throat (28.6%), followed by fever (25.0%). Diarrhea was not common\n(10.7%). Two patients had no symptoms. Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed infiltration in 46.4% of the patients, but computed tomography scan confirmed pneumonia in 88.9% (16/18) of the patients. Six\npatients (21.4%) required supplemental oxygen therapy, but no one needed mechanical ventilation. Lymphopenia was more common in severe cases. Higher level of C-reactive protein and worsening of chest radiographic score\nwas observed during the 5-7 day period after symptom onset. Viral shedding was high from day 1 of illness, especially from the upper respiratory tract (URT). CONCLUSION: The prodromal symptoms\nof COVID-19 were mild and most patients did not have limitations of daily activity. Viral shedding from URT was high from the prodromal phase.

COVID-19 is predominantly caused by contact or droplet transmission attributed to relatively large respiratory\nparticles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately one metre from the patient. Airborne transmission may occur if patient respiratory activity or medical procedures generate respiratory aerosols.\nThese aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distances and remain airborne longer, but their infective potential is uncertain. Contact, droplet and airborne transmission are each relevant during airway\nmanoeuvres in infected patients, particularly during tracheal intubation. Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protecting staff and other patients from COVID-19 cross-infection.\nAppropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission. Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care - contact, droplet, or\nairborne. Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipment use is not. Only airborne precautions include a fitted high-filtration mask, and this should be reserved for aerosol-generating procedures.

One of the interventions implemented by the government is a school closure. The Ministry of\nEducation decided to postpone the school opening from March 2 to April 6 to minimize epidemic size. We aimed to quantify the school closure effect on the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS:\nThe potential effects of school opening were measured using a mathematical model considering two age groups: children (aged 19 years and younger) and adults (aged over 19). Based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered\nmodel, isolation and behavior-changed susceptible individuals are additionally considered. The transmission parameters were estimated from the laboratory confirmed data reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from\nFebruary 16 to March 22. The model was extended with estimated parameters and estimated the expected number of confirmed cases as the transmission rate increased after school opening. RESULTS: Assuming\nthe transmission rate between children group would be increasing 10 fold after the schools open, approximately additional 60 cases are expected to occur from March 2 to March 9, and\napproximately additional 100 children cases are expected from March 9 to March 23. After March 23, the number of expected cases for children is 28.4 for 7 days and 33.6\nfor 14 days. CONCLUSION: The simulation results show that the government could reduce at least 200 cases, with two announcements by the Ministry of education. After March 23, although the\npossibility of massive transmission in the children's age group is lower, group transmission is possible to occur.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242349", "Tag": "Default Treatment Epidemiology"}, {"PMID": "32226104", "Title": "Editorial.", "JournalName": "Die Heilberufe", "Date Added": "20200406", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226104", "Tag": "Default"}, {"PMID": "32226106", "Title": "Pflege Perspektiven.", "JournalName": "Die Heilberufe", "Date Added": "20200406", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226106", "Tag": "Default"}, {"PMID": "32248521", "Title": "Global interim guidance on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy and puerperium from FIGO and allied partners: Information for healthcare professionals.", "JournalName": "International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics", "Date Added": "20200406", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 4", "Abstract": "In response to the World Health Organization (WHO) statements and international concerns regarding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, FIGO has issued the following guidance for the management of pregnant\nwomen at the four main settings of pregnancy: (1) ambulatory antenatal care in the outpatient clinics; (2) management in the setting of the obstetrical triage; (3) intrapartum management; and (4)\npostpartum management and neonatal care.

Since controlled production of DAMPs and SAMPs is needed to achieve full homeostatic restoration\nand repair from tissue injury, only their pathological, not their homeostatic, concentrations should be therapeutically tackled. Therefore, distinct caveats are proposed regarding choosing DAMPs and SAMPs for therapeutic purposes. For\nexample, we discuss the need to a priori identify and define a context-dependent \"homeostatic DAMP:SAMP ratio\" in each case and a \"homeostatic window\" of DAMP and SAMP concentrations to guarantee\na safe treatment modality to patients.

Social distancing measures in informal settlements may be difficult to implement due to the density and layout of settlements. This study measures the distance between dwellings in\ninformal settlements in Cape Town to identify the risk of COVID-19 transmission. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to determine if social distancing measures are achievable in informal settlements\nin Cape Town, using two settlements as an example. We will first examine the distance between dwellings and their first, second, and third nearest neighbors and then identify clusters of\ndwellings in which residents would be unable to effectively practice social isolation due to the close proximity of their homes. METHODS: Dwellings in the settlements of Masiphumelele and Klipfontein Glebe\nwere extracted from a geographic information system data set of outlines of all informal dwellings in Cape Town. The distance to each dwelling's first, second, and third nearest neighbors was\ncalculated for each settlement. A social distance measure of 2 m was used (buffer of 1 m, as dwellings less than 2 m apart are joined) to identify clusters of\ndwellings that are unable to effectively practice social distancing in each settlement. RESULTS: The distance to each dwelling's first 3 nearest neighbors illustrates that the settlement of Masiphumelele is constructed\nin a denser fashion as compared to the Klipfontein Glebe settlement. This implies that implementing social distancing will likely be more challenging in Masiphumelele than in Klipfontein Glebe. However, using\na 2-m social distancing measure, it was demonstrated that large portions of Klipfontein Glebe would also be unable to effectively implement social distancing.

After this, news spread that ACEis and ARBs would be harmful in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. To the contrary, compelling evidence exists that the\nACE-1/angiotensin(Ang)II/ATR-1 pathway is involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS, while the ACE-2/Ang(1-7)/ATR2/MasR pathway counteracts the harmful actions of AngII in the lung. A reduced ACE-1/ACE-2 ratio is, in fact, a feature of\nARDS that can be rescued by human recombinant ACE-2 and Ang(1-7) administration, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2-induced damage to the lung.

The medical records of 25 adults and\n7 children confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV ARD were reviewed retrospectively. All children were family clusters. The total adult patients were differentiated into: the local residents of Wuhan, a history of\ntravel to Wuhan and direct contact with people from Wuhan. The numbers were 14 (56%), 10 (40%) & 1 (4%), respectively. The median incubation period of children and adults was\n5 days (range 3-12 days) and 4 days (range 2-12 days), respectively. Diarrhoea and/or vomiting (57.1%) were more common in children, whereas for adults it was myalgia or fatigue (52%).\nOn admission, the percentage of children having pneumonia (5, 71.4%) was roughly the same as adults (20, 80%). 20% of adults had leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was more frequently in children\n(28.6%, P=0.014). A higher number of children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs. 4%, P=0.004).

In the web-2 era much of this misinformation is disseminated via social media\nwhere information could spread easily and quickly. Monitoring social media content provides crucial insights for health managers to manage the crisis. OBJECTIVE: Objective: Given the misinformation surrounding COVID-19 outbreak, this\nstudy was aimed to analyze contents of the most commonly used social networks in Iran that is among the affected countries. METHODS: Methods: A social media monitoring conducted through a\nqualitative design to analyze the discussions of social media users about the content related to COVID-19 transferred via Iranian medical faculty members` groups in Telegram and Whats App during Feb\n20 to March 20, 2020 emphasizing the misinformation. Discourse analysis was applied and the written dialogues and discussions regarding misinformation about different aspects of the outbreak between medical faculty members\nall over the country were analyzed. RESULTS: Results: Cultural factors, demand pressure for information during the crisis, the easiness of information dissemination via social networks, marketing incentives and the poor\nlegal supervision of online contents are the main reasons of misinformation dissemination. Disease statistics; treatments, vaccines and medicines; prevention and protection methods; dietary recommendations and disease transmission ways are the\nmain subjective categories of releasing misinformation regarding novel coronavirus outbreak. Consequences of misinformation dissemination regarding disease include psychosocial; economic; health status; health system and ethical ones.

Human ACE2 is now established\nas a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Where variations in the viral spike protein in turn lead to the cross species transmission of the virus, genetic variations in the\nhost receptor ACE2, may also contribute to the susceptibility and/or resistance against the viral infection. This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2\nallelic variants with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Briefly, coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the reported binding sites for its attachment with coronavirus spike protein were selected and molecular models of\nthese variants were constructed by homology modelling. The models were then superimposed over the native ACE2 and ACE2-spike protein complex, to observe structural changes in the ACE2 variants and their\nintermolecular interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein respectively. Despite strong overall structural similarities, spatial orientation of the key interacting residues varies in the ACE2 variants compared to the wild type molecule.\nMost ACE2 variants showed similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild type ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P)\nand rs143936283 (E329G) showed noticeable variations in their intermolecular interactions with the viral spike protein. In summary, our data provide structural basis of potential resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection driven by\nACE2 allelic variants. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following\nepidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). Results: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study\n(263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of\npatients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS\nscores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic.\nThe early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Conclusion: Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European\nCOVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms. The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.

The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus\noutbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes\nof COVID-19 during pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched databases for all case reports and series from February 12 to April 4, 2020. Multiple terms and combinations were used including\nCOVID-19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS-CoV-2. Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed publications written in English or Chinese and quantitative\nreal-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, cases with suspected COVID-19\nthat were not confirmed by a laboratory test, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes were excluded. Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and\nanalyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen articles reporting data from 108 pregnancies between December 8, 2019 and April 1, 2020 were included in the current study.

To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those\nwho have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e. \"convalescent\") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following resolution of infection and\ndevelopment of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples, where convalescent\nplasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]).

Studies suggest that there are many differences\nbetween men and women in the immune response to CoV-19 infection and inflammatory diseases. Women, compared to men, are less susceptible to viral infections based on a different innate immunity,\nsteroid hormones and factors related to sex chromosomes. The presence of two X chromosomes in women emphasize the immune system even if one is inactive. The immune regulatory genes encoded\nby X chromosome in female gender causes lower viral load levels, and less inflammation than in man, while CD4+ T cells are higher with better immune response. In addition, women\ngenerally produce higher levels of antibodies which remain in the circulation longer. The levels of activation of the immune cells are higher in women than in men, and it is\ncorrelated with the trigger of TLR7 and the production of IFN. TLR7 is higher in women than in men and its biallelic expression leads to higher immune responses and increases\nthe resistance to viral infections. TLR7 is expressed in innate immune cells which recognizes single strand RNA virus by promoting the production of antibodies against the virus and the generation\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1 family members. Moreover, in women the production of inflammatory IL-6 after viral infection is lower than in males and is often correlated with\na better longevity. In addition, on the X chromosome there are loci that code for the genes involved in the regulation of immune cells such as FOXP3, and transcription factor\nfor Treg involved in virus pathogenesis. The X chromosome influences the immune system by acting on many other proteins, including TLR8, CD40L and CXCR3 which can be over-expressed in women,\nand influence the response to viral infections and vaccinations. However, the biallelic expression of the X-linked genes can promote harmful autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Cardiovascular diseases are more frequent in\nmales and subjects without cardiovascular dysfunctions infected by CoV-19 have a better prognosis. ACE2 is a receptor for CoV-19 and protects lung damage. CoV-19 infection and the virus's Spike protein\ninhibit the expression of ACE2, abolishing its protective function. Inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI) are used to stem the devastating effects of CoV-19, to increase the number of\nCD3 and CD8 T cells and to reduce the viral load and IL-6 levels that control CoV-19 replication via NF-B, but these effects are still under study. It is hoped\nthat certain drugs, such as CoV-19 receptor blockers, anti-inflammatories (against rheumatic diseases), monoclonal antibodies, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6, the remdesevir drug (analogue adenosine, effective against ebola), hydroxychloroquine (for the treatment of\nmalaria) and vaccines, will open up new strategies and new therapeutic ways to combat this terrible virus.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253888", "Tag": "Default Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32255507", "Title": "COVID-19 And Older Adults: What We Know.", "JournalName": "Journal of the American Geriatrics Society", "Date Added": "20200408", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 7", "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus that causes COVID-19 infection, has recently emerged and caused a deadly pandemic.

The expansion of\ntelehealth services is expected to deliver timely care for the initial screening of symptomatic patients while minimizing exposure in health care facilities, to protect health care providers and other patients.\nHowever, it is currently unknown whether US hospitals have the telehealth capacity to meet the increasing demand and needs of patients during this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the population-level internet\nsearch volume for telehealth (as a proxy of population interest and demand) with the number of new COVID-19 cases and the proportion of hospitals that adopted a telehealth system in\nall US states. METHODS: We used internet search volume data from Google Trends to measure population-level interest in telehealth and telemedicine between January 21, 2020 (when the first COVID-19 case\nwas reported), and March 18, 2020. Data on COVID-19 cases in the United States were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center. We also used data from the 2018\nAmerican Hospital Association Annual Survey to estimate the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (including telemedicine and electronic visits) and those with the capability of telemedicine intensive care unit (tele-ICU).\nPearson correlation was used to examine the relations of population search volume for telehealth and telemedicine (composite score) with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States during\nthe study period and the proportion of hospitals with telehealth and tele-ICU capabilities. RESULTS: We found that US population-level interest in telehealth increased as the number of COVID-19 cases increased,\nwith a strong correlation (r=0.948, P<.001). We observed a higher population-level interest in telehealth in the Northeast and West census region, whereas the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth was\nhigher in the Midwest region. There was no significant association between population interest and the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (r=0.055, P=.70) nor hospitals having tele-ICU capability (r=-0.073, P=.61).\nCONCLUSIONS: As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, so does the US population's interest in telehealth. However, the level of population interest did not correlate with the proportion of hospitals\nproviding telehealth services in the United States, suggesting that increased population demand may not be met with the current telehealth capacity.

Since the novel coronavirus has spread worldwide\nseriously, there is growing concern that patients who have chronic respiratory conditions like COPD can easily be infected and are more prone to having severe illness and even mortality because\nof lung dysfunction. Loquat leaves have long been used as an important material for both pharmaceutical and functional applications in the treatment of lung disease in Asia, especially in China\nand Japan. Total flavonoids (TF), the main active components derived from loquat leaves, showed remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, their protective activity against CS-induced COPD airway inflammation and oxidative\nstress and its underlying mechanism still remain not well-understood. The present study uses a CS-induced mouse model to estimate the morphological changes in lung tissue. The results demonstrated that TF\nsuppressed the histological changes in the lungs of CS-challenged mice, as evidenced by reduced generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide\n(NO), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and diminished the protein expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Moreover, TF also inhibited phosphorylation of IKK, IkappaB and NFkappaB and\nincreased p-Akt. Interestingly, TF could inhibit CS-induced oxidative stress in the lungs of COPD mice. TF treatment significantly inhibited the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide\ndismutase (SOD). In addition, TF markedly downregulated TRPV1 and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and upregulated the expression of SOD-2, while the p-JNK level was observed to be inhibited in COPD\nmice. Taken together, our findings showed that the protective effect and putative mechanism of the action of TF resulted in the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress through the regulation\nof TRPV1 and the related signal pathway in lung tissues. It suggested that TF derived from loquat leaves could be considered to be an alternative or a new functional material\nand used for the treatment of CS-induced COPD.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253400", "Tag": "Default Mortality Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32253375", "Title": "Nutritional management in hospital setting during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: a real-life experience.", "JournalName": "European journal of clinical nutrition", "Date Added": "20200408", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 6", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253375", "Tag": "Default"}, {"PMID": "32253371", "Title": "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urology residency training in Italy.", "JournalName": "Minerva urologica e nefrologica = The Italian journal of urology and nephrology", "Date Added": "20200408", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 7", "Abstract": "In the global emergency scenario caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the Urology residents' training might be critically affected.

The spread\nof COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers\nof severe cases. For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill\nto the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment. While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as\nthe disease advances. Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19\nhas not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints. To address this deficit, a\nmultidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios\nrepresenting varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints. Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the\npanel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide. The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended\nto guide medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in the management of COVID-19.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32255413", "Tag": "Mortality Default"}, {"PMID": "32259247", "Title": "Pain Management Best Practices from Multispecialty Organizations during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Public Health Crises.", "JournalName": "Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)", "Date Added": "20200408", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 7", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is nearly impossible to overestimate the burden of chronic pain, which is associated with enormous personal and socioeconomic costs. Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability in\nthe world, is associated with multiple psychiatric co-morbidities, and has been causally linked for the opioid crisis. Access to pain treatment has been called a fundamental human right by numerous\norganizations. The current COVID-19 pandemic has strained medical resources, creating a dilemma for physicians charged with a responsibility to limit spread of the contagion, and their responsibility to treat the\npatients they are entrusted to care for. METHODS: To address these issues, an expert panel was convened that included pain management experts from the military, Veterans Health Administration, and academia.\nEndorsement from stakeholder societies was sought upon completion of the document, with a 1-week suspense period. RESULTS: In these guidelines, we provide a framework for pain practitioners and institutions to\nbalance the often-conflicting goals of risk mitigation for health care providers, risk mitigation for patients, conservation of resources, and access to pain management services. Specific issues discussed include general and\ninterventional-specific risk mitigation, patient flow issues and staffing plans, telemedicine options, triaging recommendations, strategies to reduce psychological sequelae in health care providers, and resource utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 public health\ncrisis has strained health care systems, creating a conundrum for patients, pain medicine practitioners, hospital leaders, and regulatory officials. Although this document provides a framework for pain management services, systems-wide\nand individual decisions must take into account clinical considerations, regional health conditions, government and hospital directives, resource availability, the welfare of health care providers.

Objective: To estimate the timing of surges in clinical\ndemand and the best- and worst-case scenarios of local COVID-19-induced strain on hospital capacity, and thus inform clinical operations and staffing demands and identify when hospital capacity would be saturated.\nDesign: Monte Carlo simulation instantiation of a susceptible, infected, removed (SIR) model with a 1-day cycle. Setting: 3 hospitals in an academic health system. Patients: All people living in the\ngreater Philadelphia region. Measurements: The COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model (CHIME) (http://penn-chime.phl.io) SIR model was used to estimate the time from 23 March 2020 until hospital capacity would probably be exceeded,\nand the intensity of the surge, including for intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators. Results: Using patients with COVID-19 alone, CHIME estimated that it would be 31 to 53\ndays before demand exceeds existing hospital capacity. In best- and worst-case scenarios of surges in the number of patients with COVID-19, the needed total capacity for hospital beds would reach\n3131 to 12 650 across the 3 hospitals, including 338 to 1608 ICU beds and 118 to 599 ventilators. Limitations: Model parameters were taken directly or derived from published data\nacross heterogeneous populations and practice environments and from the health system's historical data. CHIME does not incorporate more transition states to model infection severity, social networks to model transmission dynamics,\nor geographic information to account for spatial patterns of human interaction.

Methods: Six burn patients combined with inhalation injury were\nhospitalized in Department of Burns of Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University& Wuhan Third Hospital from February 1 to March 1 in 2020duringhigh-incidence period of COVID-19, including 4 males and 2\nfemales, aged 21-63 years, hospitalized for 2-4 hours, with total burn areas of 1%-20% TBSA and full-thickness burn areas of 1%-12% TBSA. Among them, 1 case was severe inhalation injury,\n2 cases were mild inhalation injury, and 3 cases were moderate inhalation injury. The body temperatures of the patients were normal at admission without fever or cough in the past\n2 weeks. At admission, chest CT of one patient showed double lower lobes and left upper lobes had multiple slices and slightly high-density shadow of nodules. Chest CT of two\npatients showed bilateral lung texture was thickening, and chest CT of other patients was normal. After admission, 6 patients were given routine treatment, the medical staffs paid attention to the\nprotection and screened COVID-19 according to the diagnosis and treatment plan of COVID-19. On post injury day (PID) 1, 3, 6, and 9, vein blood of patients were collected for\ndetermination of white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, lymphocyte absolute value. and level of procalcitonin (PCT). Nucleic acid of novel coronavirus was detected by real-time fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain\nreaction on PID 3 and 6. The temperatures of patients were recorded after admission. The results of chest CT within one week after injury and the prognosis of the patients\nwere recorded. Measurement data distributed normally were expressed as x +/- s, and measurement data distributed abnormally were expressed as M (P(25), P(75)). Results: (1) On PID1, 3, 6, and\n9, WBC counts of patients were respectively (19.8+/-3.8)x10(9)/L, (17.2+/-3.4)x10(9)/L,(13.3+/-3.1)x10(9)/L, and (11.1+/-1.6)x10(9)/L, neutrophils of patients were respectively0.919+/-0.019,0.899+/-0.011, 0.855+/-0.034, and0.811+/-0.035, absolute values of lymphocytes of patients were respectively(0.65+/-0.18)x10(9)/L,(0.65+/-0.24)x10(9)/L,(0.91+/-0.34)x10(9)/L, and (1.23+/-0.42)x10(9)/L,and PCT values\nof patients were respectively0.49 (0.36, 1.64), 0.39 (0.26, 0.73), 0.28 (0.18, 0.33), and 0.12 (0.11, 0.20) ng/mL.The values of WBC and neutrophils of patients were higher than the normal value,\nshowing a downward trend. The absolute values of lymphocyte of patients returned to the normal value gradually. The PCT values of patients were higher than the normal value.

To support WHO with their recommendations on quarantine,\nwe conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a rapid review to assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination\nwith other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high transmission of\nthe disease. SEARCH METHODS: An information specialist searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 12 February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020.\nWHO provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Cohort studies, case-control-studies, case series, time series, interrupted time series, and mathematical modelling studies\nthat assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect\nevidence for the current coronavirus outbreak. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review author screened the remaining 70%. Two review authors screened\nall potentially relevant full-text publications independently. One review author extracted data and assessed evidence quality with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We rated the certainty of\nevidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. MAIN RESULTS: We included 29 studies; 10 modelling studies on COVID-19, four observational studies and 15 modelling\nstudies on SARS and MERS. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and conducted a narrative synthesis.\nDue to the type of evidence found for this review, GRADE rates the certainty of the evidence as low to very low. Modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the\nsimulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases averted 44% to 81% incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths compared to no measures\nbased on different scenarios (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures\nare implemented, the greater the cost savings (2 modelling studies on SARS). Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak\non reducing incidence and deaths was small (2 modelling studies on SARS). When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, including school closures, travel restrictions and social\ndistancing, the models demonstrated a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than individual measures alone (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 2\nmodelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence\nfor COVID-19 is limited to modelling studies that make parameter assumptions based on the current, fragmented knowledge. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures,\ndecision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented. Testing in representative samples in different settings could help assess the true prevalence of infection,\nand would reduce uncertainty of modelling assumptions.

The highly contagious nature of this virus makes it\nimperative for us to identify promising inhibitors from pre-existing antiviral drugs. Two druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) were selected in this study due to their\nindispensable nature in the viral life cycle. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease responsible for the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins resulting in the formation of various functional proteins, whereas 2'-O-MTase methylates\nthe ribose 2'-O position of the first and second nucleotide of viral mRNA, which sequesters it from the host immune system. The selected drug target proteins were screened against an\nin-house library of 123 antiviral drugs. Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (DeltaG), the orientation of drug molecules in\nthe active site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were then subjected to MD simulation, which consists of various structural parameters to equivalently reflect their physiological state. From\nthe virtual screening results, two drug molecules were selected for each drug target protein [Paritaprevir (DeltaG= -9.8 kcal/mol) &Raltegravir (DeltaG= -7.8 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro and Dolutegravir (DeltaG= -9.4 kcal/mol) and\nBictegravir (DeltaG= -8.4 kcal/mol) for 2'-OMTase].

Following a single-dose intranasal immunization, PIV5-MERS-S induced neutralizing antibody and robust T cell responses in hDPP4 KI mice. A single intranasal administration\nof 10(4) PFU PIV5-MERS-S provided complete protection against a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERSMA6.1.2) and improved virus clearance in the lung. In comparison, single-dose intramuscular immunization with 10(6) PFU\nUV-inactivated MERSMA6.1.2 mixed with Imject alum provided protection to only 25% of immunized mice.

Regional Italian medical and political authorities have implemented extraordinary measures to contain the spread of the virus. This disease may cause massive diffuse alveolar damage resulting in\nacute respiratory failure (ARF) that requires, in a high percentage of cases, mechanical ventilation [5\u20138]. Based on our general experience so far in dealing with the disease and on the\nexisting knowledge (albeit still limited and evolving) [5\u20138], Italian respiratory scientific societies proposes here an Early Consensus Statement Management for non-ICU ARF SARS-CoV-2 emergency. It represents the expert opinion of\npulmonologists directly involved in the first line of assistance. The Consensus identified two urgent areas for action: a) management, and b) organisation. We carried out a search of the published\nliterature in PubMed, Ovid, Embase databases and relevant websites from the construction of the databases to March 20, 2020 in order to retrieve guidelines and recommendations, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, state\nof the art papers, and randomised trials. The search terms used were: \u201cCoronavirus pneumonia\u201d, \u201cARDS\u201d, \u201cAcute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure\u201d, \u201cSARS\u201d, \u201cMERS\u201d, \u201cInfluenza\u201d, Acute Respiratory Failure or Mechanical Ventilation\u201d, \u201cNoninvasive ventilation\nAND Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure\u201d. Based on the literature search, a small group of 4 pulmonologists professionals produced a preliminary document, which was then submitted to the consensus group of\n10 doctors. Consensus on the final document was achieved through video conference meetings (Conference Call). Using a Delphi-like procedure, we asked the experts to rate the entire document on a\n5-point Likert scale (0=totally disagree; 1=disagree; 2=sufficiently agree; 3=moderately agree; 4=totally agree). Consensus was considered when more than 75% of the respondents rated the document as \u201ctotally agree\u201d. In this\ncontext the proposed paper is a changeable consensus not necessarily totally in line with the WHO documents because the Italian situation was and unfortunately still is continuously in progression day\nby day.

DESIGN: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase\nthrough Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. DATA EXTRACTION: At least two authors\nindependently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of\nbias assessment tool). RESULTS: 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events\n(as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models\nfor predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of\ncovid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived\nfrom computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all\nthree models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of\nthe 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of\ninterest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population\nor intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. CONCLUSION: Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at\na time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing\nof well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies\ncould be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should\nadhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

To date, there are no medical treatments for COVID-19 with proven effectiveness. Novel\ntreatments and/or vaccines will take time to be developed and distributed to patients. In light of this, there has been growing interest in the use of existing medications, such as\nchloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as potential treatments of this disease. AIM: To establish the current evidence for the effectiveness of CQ and HCQ in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING:\nA rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches in PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted on 21 March 2020. A further search was conducted in Google for\nrelevant literature on 28 March 2020. RESULTS: There is limited evidence of in vitro activity of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. A number of in vivo clinical trials are underway. The empirical\ndata available from two of these trials reveal conflicting results. Both trials are characterised by small numbers of participants (n = 30 and n = 36) and suffer methodological limitations.\nNo medium or long-term follow-up data is available. CONCLUSION: At present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether CQ/HCQ are safe and effective treatments for COVID-19. High quality, adequately powered\nrandomised clinical trials in primary and secondary care settings are urgently required to guide policymakers and clinicians.

ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2\nreceptor, the infective agent responsible for COVID-19, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of\nSARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of\nACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced\nand preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential\nmechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1-7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease\nconditions associated with an activated RAS. Recombinant human ACE2 has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively. Our review summarizes the\nprogress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the RAS, together with implications for the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32264791", "Tag": "Default"}, {"PMID": "32264667", "Title": "First impact on services and their preparation. \"Instant paper from the field\" on rehabilitation answers to the Covid-19 emergency.", "JournalName": "European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine", "Date Added": "20200409", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 8", "Abstract": "This paper reports the immediate impact of the epidemic on rehabilitation services in Italy, the first country in Europe hit by Covid-19.

The overall inadequate preparation of the rehabilitation system to face\na sudden epidemic was clear, and similar to that of the acute services. The original idea of confining the Covid-19 cases to some areas of rehabilitation wards and/or hospitals, preserving\nothers, proved not to be feasible. Continuous reorganization and adaptation were required due to the rapid changes. Overall, rehabilitation needs had to surrender to the more acute emergency, with total\nconversion of beds, wards and even hospitals. The quarantine needs heavily involved also outpatient services that were mostly closed. Rehabilitation professionals needed support, but also acted properly, again similarly to\nwhat happened in the acute wards. The typical needs of rehabilitation, such as human and physical contacts, but also social interactions including patient, team, family and caregivers, appeared clearly in\nthe current unavoidable need of being suppressed.

COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei\nPrimari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of\nthe epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19\ndiffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented\nthrough the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits, and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology\ndepartments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency.

Here, we present\nthe rationale and design of a large, international trial that combines features of adaptive platform trials with pragmatic point-of-care trials to determine best treatment strategies for patients admitted to an\nintensive care unit with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The trial uses a novel design entitled a randomized embedded multifactorial adaptive platform (REMAP). The design has 5 key features: i.) randomization,\nallowing robust causal inference; ii.) embedding of study procedures into routine care processes, facilitating enrollment, trial efficiency, and generalizability; iii.) a multifactorial statistical model comparing multiple interventions across multiple patient\nsubgroups; iv.) response-adaptive randomization with preferential assignment to those interventions that appear most favorable, and v.) a platform structured to permit continuous, potentially perpetual enrollment beyond the evaluation of the\ninitial treatments. The trial randomizes patients to multiple interventions within 4 treatment domains: antibiotics, antiviral therapy for influenza, host immunomodulation with extended macrolide therapy, and alternative corticosteroid regimens, representing 240\ntreatment regimens. The trial generates estimates of superiority, inferiority and equivalence between regimens on the primary outcome of 90-day mortality, stratified by presence or absence of concomitant shock and proven\nor suspected influenza infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a patient portal-based\nCOVID-19 self-triage and self-scheduling tool and made it available to all primary care patients at this large academic health system. Asymptomatic patients were asked about exposure history and were then\nprovided relevant information. Symptomatic patients were triaged into one of four categories-emergent, urgent, non-urgent or self-care- and then connected with the appropriate level of care via direct scheduling or telephone\nhotline. RESULTS: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was designed and implemented in under two weeks. During the first 16 days of use, it was completed 1129 times by 950 unique\npatients. Of completed sessions, 315 (28%) were by asymptomatic patients, and 814 (72%) were by symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patient triage dispositions were as follows: 193 emergent (24%), 193 urgent (24%),\n99 nonurgent (12%), 329 self-care (40%). Sensitivity for detecting emergency-level care was 87.5% (95% CI 61.7-98.5%). DISCUSSION: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool has been widely used by patients and is\nbeing rapidly expanded to other populations and health systems. The tool has recommended emergency-level care with high sensitivity, and decreased triage time for patients with less severe illness. The data\nsuggests it also prevents unnecessary triage messages, phone calls and in-person visits. CONCLUSION: Patient self-triage tools integrated into electronic health record systems have the potential to greatly improve triage efficiency\nand prevent unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267928", "Tag": "Treatment Default"}, {"PMID": "32267732", "Title": "Considerations for Drug Interactions on QTc in Exploratory COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Treatment.", "JournalName": "Circulation", "Date Added": "20200409", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 8", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267732", "Tag": "Treatment Default"}, {"PMID": "32268390", "Title": "Responding to COVID-19: The UW Medicine Information Technology Services Experience.", "JournalName": "Applied clinical informatics", "Date Added": "20200409", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: UW Medicine was one of the first health systems to encounter and treat COVID-19 patients in the United States, starting in late February 2020.

METHODS: Our recommendations include establishing a hospital incident command structure that includes tight integration with IT, creating automated\ndashboards for incident command, optimizing emergency communication to staff and patients, and preparing human resources, security, other policies, and equipment to support the transition of all nonessential staff to telework.We\ndescribe how UW Medicine quickly expanded telemedicine capabilities to include most primary care providers and increasing numbers of specialty providers. We look at how we managed expedited change control processes\nto quickly update electronic health records (EHR) with new COVID-19 laboratory and clinical workflows. We also examine the integration of new technology such as tele-intensive care (ICU) equipment and improved\nintegration with teleconferencing software into our EHR.

Methods: This study covered the period from January 14 to March\n1, 2020. From February 24 on, the supine position method and the protective face screen were used to collect nasopharyngeal swabs, before which, the nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by sitting\nposition method. All the patients were diagnosed with suspected/confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection, who were admitted from February 19 on, before which, the nasopharyngeal swabs were collected outside the hospital.\n(1) Thirty-four operators meeting the inclusion criteria of the study were recruited in this retrospective cohort study. They were grouped according to the collection method of nasopharyngeal swabs. Sixteen operators\nof Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who used the supine position method and the protective face screen were included in supine position method+protective face screen group (15 males and 1 female,\naged 34-49 years); 18 operators (12 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University), 1 from Wuhan Jiangxia Mobile Cabin Hospital, 5 from the\nEast District of People's Hospital of Wuhan University) who used the traditional sitting position method were included in sitting position method group (2 males and 16 females, aged 25-49 years).\nIn supine position method+protective face screen group, when collecting sample, the patient lay flat and wore a special protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with neck slightly extending and\nface turning to the opposite side of the operator about 10 degrees . The self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate the cooperation, the incidence of nausea, coughing, sneezing, and struggling\nof patients evaluated by the operators, the operation time of single sampling, the fear of operation and the perceived exposure risk of operators of the two groups. (2) Sixty-five patients\n(22 males and 43 females, aged 25-91 years) admitted to Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who successively received the sitting position method and supine position method+protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swabs\nsampling and with complete nucleic acid detection results were included. The positive rates of nucleic acid detection by the two sampling methods of nasopharyngeal swabs of the patients were statistically\nanalyzed. (3) Forty-one patients who could express their feelings accurately were selected from the above 65 patients (12 males and 29 females, aged 27-83 years). The comfort of patients in\nthe process of sampling by the two methods was investigated. (4) Thirty-four patients (10 males and 24 females, aged 25-83 years) with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic\nacid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method were selected from the above 65 patients. The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swab of patients by supine\nposition method+protective face screen, i.e. negative to positive rate was statistically analyzed. Data were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon's sign rank test, t test, and chi-square test. Results: (1) The cooperation\nscore of patients evaluated by the operators in supine position method+protective face screen group was significantly higher than that in sitting position method group (Z=-4.928, P<0.01), the incidence of nausea,\nchoking cough, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, and the fear of operation score and the perceived exposure risk score of operators were significantly lower than those\nof sitting position method group (Z=-5.071, -5.046, -4.095, -4.397, -4.174, -5.049, P<0.01), and the operation time of single sampling was significantly longer than that of sitting position method group (t=23.17,\nP<0.01). (2) The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by supine position method+protective face screen was 60.00% (39/65), which was obviously higher than 41.54% (27/65) by sitting\nposition method (chi(2)=4.432, P<0.05). (3) The comfort score of the 41 patients during nasopharyngeal swabs sampling by supine position method+protective face screen was significantly higher than that by sitting position\nmethod (Z=-5.319, P<0.01). (4) Of the 34 patients with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method, the rate of negative\nto positive of nucleic acid detection was 26.47% (9/34) after sampling by supine position method+protective face screen. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional sitting position method, detection of 2019 novel coronavirus\nnucleic acids of nasopharyngeal swabs collected by supine method combined with protective face screen is worth promoting, because of its better comfort of patients, low exposure risk for operators, in\naddition to reducing in the false negative result to some extent, which may help reduce false recurrence of discharged patients.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32268456", "Tag": "Treatment Default"}, {"PMID": "32252746", "Title": "The influence of job satisfaction, resilience and work engagement on turnover intention among village doctors in China: a cross-sectional study.", "JournalName": "BMC Health Services Research", "Date Added": "20200406", "Publication Date": "2020", "Abstract": "Background: As the gatekeepers of rural residents\u2019 health, teams of village doctors play a vital role in improving rural residents\u2019 health.

This research evaluated the influence of job satisfaction, resilience, and work engagement on the village doctors\u2019 turnover intention, and explored the\nmediating role of work engagement and resilience between job satisfaction and the turnover intention of village doctors in China. Methods: A quantitative study using a self-administered questionnaire containing mostly structured\nitems was conducted among village doctors with a sample size of 2693 from 1345 rural clinics in Shandong province, China, during May and June 2019. All variables including demographic characteristics,\njob satisfaction, resilience, work engagement and turnover intention were based on available literature, and measured on a 5- or 6-point Likert scale. Such statistical methods as one-way ANOVA, bivariate correlation,\nexploratory factor analysis (EFA), and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) were used. Results: Up to 46.9% of the subjects had a higher turnover intention and more than 26.3% of them had\na medium turnover intention. The job satisfaction of village doctors could not only have a direct negative effect on turnover intention (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.37, p\u2009<\u20090.001), but also have an indirect effect through\nwork engagement (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.04,=<\u20090.001). Meanwhile, work engagement also had a direct negative impact on turnover intention (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.13, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and resilience had an indirect negative impact on turnover intention through work engagement\n(\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.09, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

The spread\nof COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers\nof severe cases. For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill\nto the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment. While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as\nthe disease advances.

However, the underlying mechanism that confers these viral characteristics on high\ntransmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood. METHODS: We comprehensively investigated the replication, cell tropism, and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues with SARS-CoV included as\na comparison. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated in human lung tissues more efficiently than that of SARS-CoV. Within the 48-hour interval, SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.20 folds more infectious virus particles than\nthat of SARS-CoV from the infected lung tissues (P<0.024). SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were similar in cell tropism, with both targeting types I and II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages.

During March 5-9, 2020,\ntwo residents of a senior independent and assisted living community in Seattle (facility 1) were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection; on March 6, social distancing and other preventive measures were\nimplemented in the community. UW Medicine (the health system linked to the University of Washington), Public Health - Seattle & King County, and CDC conducted an investigation at the facility.\nOn March 10, all residents and staff members at facility 1 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and asked to complete a questionnaire about their symptoms; all\nresidents were tested again 7 days later. Among 142 residents and staff members tested during the initial phase, three of 80 residents (3.8%) and two of 62 staff members (3.2%)\nhad positive test results.

The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might\ncause olfactory dysfunction is certainly plausible. Patients presenting to specialized smell clinics are commonly diagnosed with upper respiratory infection (URI)-associated olfactory loss and most are presumed to be viral related.\nIn acute phases of infection, it is common to experience some smell loss as a result of nasal inflammation, mucosal edema, and obstruction of airflow into the olfactory cleft. In\nmost cases, these episodes of smell loss are self-limiting and coincide with resolution of URI symptoms. However, in some cases the smell loss persists for months to years and this\nis presumed to occur through a more direct olfactory insult by the virus. It remains too early to know whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent olfactory dysfunction. However, given the\nscale of this pandemic, if SARS-CoV-2 does cause chronic olfactory loss in even a small portion of those infected, then the overall population prevalence could be quite large. This review\nprovides a brief, practical overview of viral-associated olfactory loss, realizing that evidence related to COVID-19 will likely not be clear for some time. Our goal is to highlight the existence\nand importance of this condition and provide information geared for both providers and patients. Practical suggestions regarding evaluation and treatment will be provided, realizing that there may be constraints on\nmedical resources and the nature of this pandemic remains dynamic.

At the time the investigation began, testing guidance recommended focusing on persons with clinical findings\nof lower respiratory illness and travel to an affected area or an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, or on persons hospitalized for severe respiratory disease and no alternative\ndiagnosis (1). To rapidly understand the extent of COVID-19 in the community, SCCPHD, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and CDC began sentinel surveillance in Santa Clara County. During\nMarch 5-14, 2020, four urgent care centers in Santa Clara County participated as sentinel sites. For this investigation, county residents evaluated for respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of\nbreath) who had no known risk for COVID-19 were identified at participating urgent care centers. A convenience sample of specimens that tested negative for influenza virus was tested for SARS-CoV-2\nRNA. Among 226 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 23% had positive test results for influenza. Among patients who had negative test results for influenza, 79 specimens were tested for\nSARS-CoV-2, and 11% had evidence of infection. This sentinel surveillance system helped confirm community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. As a result of these data and an increasing\nnumber of cases with no known source of transmission, the county initiated a series of community mitigation strategies. Detection of community transmission is critical for informing response activities, including testing\ncriteria, quarantine guidance, investigation protocols, and community mitigation measures (2). Sentinel surveillance in outpatient settings and emergency departments, implemented together with hospital-based surveillance, mortality surveillance, and serologic surveys, can provide\na robust approach to monitor the epidemiology of COVID-19.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271724", "Tag": "Default Epidemiology Mortality"}, {"PMID": "32270500", "Title": "Four cases from a family cluster were diagnosed as COVID-19 after 14-day of quarantine period.", "JournalName": "Journal of medical virology", "Date Added": "20200410", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr 8", "Abstract": "Since December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has spread to a lot of countries worldwide(1,2) .

In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput\nscreening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (M(pro)). M(pro) is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and\ntranscription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus(5,6). Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus\nM(pro) in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and\nother pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of M(pro).

Some orthopaedic surgeons in\nWuhan were infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information\nsuch as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices. To further explore the possible risk factors\nat the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19. The incidence\nin each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%. The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the\npeak of the public epidemic. The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the\noutpatient clinic (4.2%). There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%).\nParticipation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12). Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a\nrisk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]). Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15). Severe fatigue was found\nto be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Common places of work\ncould be contaminated.

METHODS: Between December 31, 2019 and March 7, 2020, 23 hospitalized\npregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Clinical presentations were collected retrospectively from records, including laboratory testing, chest CT imaging, and symptoms.

We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these\ndifferences. METHODS: Collaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China. Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and\nthe time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients in and outside of Hubei. The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed\nkey factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicenter as well the administrative center of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission\non prognosis were also determined. RESULTS: Upon data cut-off (Jan 31st, 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort). The overall rate of\nsevere cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively. Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597/647, 92.3%) were older (mean: 49.7 versus 44.9 years), had more cases with comorbidity\n(32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations, and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5 days) compared with patients outside Hubei. Patients\nin Hubei [severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, hazards ratio (HR) for critical illness 1.59, 95%CI 1.05-2.41] have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside\nof Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity. However, among patients outside of Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean: 4.4 versus 4.7 days) and prognosis (HR 0.84,\n95%CI 0.40-1.80) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure. In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic\nfactor (HR 1.05, 1.01-1.08). CONCLUSION: There were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset\nto hospitalisation in the epicenter.

We evaluated the extent to which self-isolation of mildly\nill people delays the peak of outbreaks and reduces the need for this care in each Canadian province. METHODS: We developed a computational model and simulated scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks\nwithin each province. Using estimates of COVID-19 characteristics, we projected the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed requirements without self-isolation, assuming an average number of 2.5 secondary cases, and\ncompared scenarios in which different proportions of mildly ill people practised self-isolation 24 hours after symptom onset. RESULTS: Without self-isolation, the peak of outbreaks would occur in the first half\nof June, and an average of 569 ICU bed days per 10 000 population would be needed. When 20% of cases practised self-isolation, the peak was delayed by 2-4 weeks,\nand ICU bed requirement was reduced by 23.5% compared with no self-isolation. Increasing self-isolation to 40% reduced ICU use by 53.6% and delayed the peak of infection by an additional\n2-4 weeks. Assuming current ICU bed occupancy rates above 80% and self-isolation of 40%, demand would still exceed available (unoccupied) ICU bed capacity.

METHODS: We used an age-structured\ncompartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada. We compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and quarantine to scenarios with the following: enhanced case finding,\nrestrictive physical-distancing measures, or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive physical distancing.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level\nof awareness, perception, and attitude regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and infection control among Jordanian dentists. METHODS: The study population consisted of dentists who worked in private clinics, hospitals, and\nhealth centers in Jordan. An online questionnaire was sent to a sample of Jordanian dentists in March 2020. The questionnaire was comprised of a series of questions about dentists' demographic\ncharacteristics; their awareness of the incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of COVID-19 and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19; and their attitude toward treating patients\nwith COVID-19. RESULTS: This study included a total of 368 dentists aged 22-73 years (mean 32.9 years, SD 10.6 years). A total of 112 (30.4%) dentists had completed a master\nor residency program in dentistry, 195 (53.0%) had received training in infection control in dentistry, and 28 (7.6%) had attended training or lectures regarding COVID-19.

A cross sectional study\nof the adult population of Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak.

It was declared by the WHO as a public\nhealth emergency. The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck\nsurgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% to 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their\nlives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply\nrespiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are:\npregnant, over 55-65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that\ninduced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Healthcare facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until\nthe present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for cancer patients. For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory\nin the following settings: a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients: b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia and dysgeusia have been\nreported in a minority of cases). For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, ; rhinoscopy or flexible\nlaryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia) it is strongly recommended that all healthcare personnel wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95, gown, cap,\neye protection and gloves. The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, otolaryngologists, head and neck, and maxillofacial surgeons are\nper se exposed to the greatest risk of infection while caring for COVID-19 positive subjects, and their protection should be considered a priority in the present circumstances.

Among medical health workers,\nhaving organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.05 or 0.01). Living in rural areas, being female, and being at risk\nof contact with COVID-19 patients were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (p < 0.01 or 0.05). Among nonmedical health workers, having organic disease\nwas a risk factor for insomnia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.01 or 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical health workers had psychosocial problems and risk factors for\ndeveloping them.

Materials and Methods: The subjects of this study were 60 trainee nurses who conducted emergency nursing practice in Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College\nof Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 1 to February 29, 2020. At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, they were divided into two groups: (1)\nthe experimental group (combined mode of MOOC micro-video) and (2) the control group (traditional theory teaching combined with clinical practice teaching). The differences of theoretical and practical examination scores and\nteaching satisfaction between the two groups were compared. Results: There was no significant difference in theoretical, practical, and total examination scores between the two groups, but in terms of teaching\nsatisfaction, the overall satisfaction, the degree of easy understanding, the evaluation of teachers and learning results in the experimental group were higher than those in the control group, with statistical\ndifference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared with the traditional teaching methods, the effect of combined mode of MOOC micro-video in emergency nursing practice is the same as that of traditional\nteaching methods, but the satisfaction is higher, so it is more suitable to be used in nursing practice during the COVID-19 epidemic period, so as to effectively reduce the cross-infection\nbetween doctors, nurses, and teaching staff.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271650", "Tag": "Treatment"}, {"PMID": "31810811", "Title": "Suspected myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19: Evidence from front-line clinical observation in Wuhan, China\u2606.", "JournalName": "International Journal of Cardiology", "Date Added": "20200408", "Publication Date": "", "Abstract": "Background: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan has caused an outbreak and become a major public health issue in China and great concern from international community. Myocarditis and myocardial\ninjury were suspected and may even be considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought\nto provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19. Methods: We enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly\nincluding cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis. Results: 112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in\nour study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis. Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at\nadmission, that in 42 (37.5%) patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died. Troponin levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death. 15 (13.4%) patients have presented\nsigns of pulmonary hypertension. Typical signs of myocarditis were absent on echocardiography and electrocardiogram. Conclusions: The clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to\nsystemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus. The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and systemic consequences and can be considered as the\nwarning sign for recent adverse clinical outcomes of the patients.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31810811", "Tag": "Default Epidemiology Treatment"}, {"PMID": "32127314", "Title": "Preparing IR for COVID-19: The Singapore Experience.", "JournalName": "Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology", "Date Added": "20200409", "Publication Date": "", "Abstract": "This paper describes country-wide special measures undertaken for interventional radiology (IR) staff during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Medical providers, teams, and organizations have needed to shift their visits away from face-to-face visits and\ntoward telehealth (both by phone and through video). Palliative care teams who practice in the community setting are faced with a difficult task: How do we actively triage the most\nurgent visits while keeping our vulnerable patients safe from the pandemic? Measures: The following are recommendations created by the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Palliative Care and Support Services team to\nhelp triage and coordinate for timely, safe, and effective palliative care in the community and outpatient setting during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are initially triaged based on location followed\nby acuity. Interdisciplinary care is implemented using strict infection control guidelines in the setting of limited personal protective equipment (PPE) resources. We implement thorough screening for COVID-19 symptoms at multiple\nlevels before a patient is seen by a designated provider. Conclusions/Lessons Learned: We recommend active triaging, communication, frequent screening for COVID-19 symptoms for palliative care patients been evaluated in the\ncommunity setting.

However, messaging has been inconsistent and unclear. Objective: To determine\nCOVID-19 awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and related behaviors among U.S. adults who are more vulnerable to complications of infection because of age and comorbid conditions. Design: Cross-sectional survey linked to 3\nactive clinical trials and 1 cohort study. Setting: 5 academic internal medicine practices and 2 federally qualified health centers. Patients: 630 adults aged 23 to 88 years living with 1\nor more chronic conditions. Measurements: Self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to COVID-19. Results: A fourth (24.6%) of participants were \"very worried\" about getting the coronavirus. Nearly a third could\nnot correctly identify symptoms (28.3%) or ways to prevent infection (30.2%). One in 4 adults (24.6%) believed that they were \"not at all likely\" to get the virus, and 21.9%\nreported that COVID-19 had little or no effect on their daily routine. One in 10 respondents was very confident that the federal government could prevent a nationwide outbreak. In multivariable\nanalyses, participants who were black, were living below the poverty level, and had low health literacy were more likely to be less worried about COVID-19, to not believe that they\nwould become infected, and to feel less prepared for an outbreak. Those with low health literacy had greater confidence in the federal government response. Limitation: Cross-sectional study of adults with\nunderlying health conditions in 1 city during the initial week of the COVID-19 U.S. outbreak. Conclusion: Many adults with comorbid conditions lacked critical knowledge about COVID-19 and, despite concern, were\nnot changing routines or plans. Noted disparities suggest that greater public health efforts may be needed to mobilize the most vulnerable communities.

The first case of COVID-19 in Singapore was detected on January 23,\n2020, and by March 16, a total of 243 cases had been confirmed, including 157 locally acquired cases. Clinical and epidemiologic findings of all COVID-19 cases in Singapore through March\n16 were reviewed to determine whether presymptomatic transmission might have occurred. Presymptomatic transmission was defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person (source patient) to a secondary patient\nbefore the source patient developed symptoms, as ascertained by exposure and symptom onset dates, with no evidence that the secondary patient had been exposed to anyone else with COVID-19. Seven\nCOVID-19 epidemiologic clusters in which presymptomatic transmission likely occurred were identified, and 10 such cases within these clusters accounted for 6.4% of the 157 locally acquired cases. In the four\nclusters for which the date of exposure could be determined, presymptomatic transmission occurred 1-3 days before symptom onset in the presymptomatic source patient. To account for the possibility of presymptomatic\ntransmission, officials developing contact tracing protocols should strongly consider including a period before symptom onset.
