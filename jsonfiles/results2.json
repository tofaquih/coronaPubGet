SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection\nhas been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan\npneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough.

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China\n(Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online\nair travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number\nof travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the\nrisk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in\n168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97).

METHODS: The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at\nthe time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included 'novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV' or 'COVID-19'.

Therefore, the present study has been planned\nto determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV and\nSARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0\nand validated by N-GlyDE server. Antigenicity was predicted by NetCTL 1.2 and validated by IEDB Analysis Resource server. The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version 1.0 based on\ncryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Our data suggests that 2019-nCoV is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in China is closely related to SARS-CoV, which has only 12.8%\nof difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9% similarity in minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV.

In addition, antigenic\nanalysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but some of the epitopes were found to be similar between both the S proteins.

RESULTS: All\n9 children had an epidemiological history, and family clustering was observed for all infected children. Among the 9 children with COVID-19, 5 had no symptoms, 4 had fever, 2 had\ncough, and 1 had rhinorrhea. There were only symptoms of the respiratory system. Laboratory examination showed no reductions in leukocyte or lymphocyte count. Among the 9 children, 6 had an\nincrease in lymphocyte count and 2 had an increase in leukocyte count. CT examination showed that among the 9 children, 8 had pulmonary inflammation located below the pleura or near\nthe interlobar fissure and 3 had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundles.

The objectives of\nthis study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus has\nalready established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact be mitigated through quarantine of symptomatic patients?\" Methods: :These questions were addressed in the context of India, using simple mathematical\nmodels of infectious disease transmission. While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model\nassumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps. Results: :It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing\nsymptoms. In an optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R00) being 1.5, and asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would reduce the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent.\nIn the pessimistic scenario of R0=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent. Interpretation & conclusions: :Port-of-entry-based entry screening of\ntravellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community. Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient\nto delay the outbreak by weeks or longer. Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden. Model projections are\nsubject to substantial uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural history of infection of this novel virus.

Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the\nlung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell\ntypes of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed\nthat ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the\ncandidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known\nreceptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted \"CellPhoneDB\" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across\ndifferent tissues.

METHODS: We used 18 indicators\nfrom the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and\n(5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level\nof national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent\ncapacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at\nlevels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did\nnot have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries\nhad level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104\n(57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries\nvary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an\neffective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19.

To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we aimed to present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South\nKorea. METHODS: The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model,\nwe estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval. RESULTS: We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95%\nCI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8),\nindicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19.

Currently, it is\nvital to explore potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we reinvestigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-CoV-like CoVs were detected by Liu et\nal. [1]. We found genomic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2-like CoV (named Pangolin-CoV) in dead Malayan pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and\nBatCoV RaTG13, respectively, at the whole-genome level. Aside from RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV is the most closely related CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to\nSARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present\nin RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2.

Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has been spreading quickly and many countries and\nterritories have been affected, with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Influenza virus has been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia.\nIt was found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and influenza virus. 5 out of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with influenza\nvirus infection, with three cases being influenza A and two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19\nas well as influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (5 [100%] patients), Cough (5 [100%] patients), shortness of breath (5 [100%] patients), nasal tampon (3 [60%]\npatients), pharyngalgia (3 [60%] patients), myalgia (2 [40%] patients), fatigue (2 [40%] patients), headache (2 [40%] patients), and expectoration (2 [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to the\nnormal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (4 [80%] patients), and liver function ALT and AST (2 [40%] patients, 2 [40%] patients) and C-reactive protein (4 [80%] patients) were increased\nwhen admitted to hospital. They stayed in hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4+/-7.02), respectively. The main complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n(1 [20%] patients), acute liver injury (3 [60%] patients), and diarrhea (2 [40%] patients). All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir), oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics. Three patients were treated\nwith glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all patients did not need ICU care and were discharged\nfrom hospital without death. In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings,\nimaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only. However, it is worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia\nmay be more prone to appear for those co-infection patients. This article is protected by copyright.

The\nlaboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods\nare fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used\nto obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over\ntime, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasal-pharynx increases. Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\nThese assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196430", "Tag": ";(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32196426", "Title": "Seasonality of Respiratory Viral Infections.", "JournalName": "Annual review of virology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/21 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 20", "Abstract": "The seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases has been widely recognized for thousands of years, as annual epidemics of the common cold and influenza disease hit the human population like\nclockwork in the winter season in temperate regions. Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter\nmonths. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters\nand human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially\ntemperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are\nlinked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections.

This novel coronavirus has specifically high morbidity in the elderly\nand in comorbid populations.

Moreover, if infected, the intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare\nsystems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high incidence rates must be taken very seriously.

The transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory\ndistress syndrome (ARDS) is highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a\npromising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ,\ncould serve as a better therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has a safer\nclinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is cheaper and more readily available in China.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation. Individual social\ncapital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress\nReaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire.

We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included eight severe or critically ill patients\nwith COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory\nfindings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The\nmost common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed\nnormal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8).

Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: As of Feb 15, 2020,\n36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported\namong affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded.

Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide\nthe highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety\nof wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the\nprocedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are\nscheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management. More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected\nor diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must\nbe run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department. (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross\ninfection of COVID-19 to patients and doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal\nobstruction) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed\nCOVID-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, body\nfluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with\nCOVID-19 must be protected by three-level. After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days.

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women and to provide some initial evidence\nthat can be used for guiding treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with\nCOVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020. A semiquantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate pulmonary involvement and the time course of changes\non chest CT. Symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were tracked. RESULTS. Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries and one vaginal\ndelivery) during the study period, and four patients were still pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the end of the study period. No\ncases of neonatal asphyxia, neonatal death, stillbirth, or abortion were reported. The most common early finding on chest CT was ground-glass opacity (GGO). With disease progression, crazy paving pattern and\nconsolidations were seen on CT. The abnormalities showed absorptive changes at the end of the study period for all patients. The most common onset symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant\nwomen were fever (13/15 patients) and cough (9/15 patients). The most common abnormal laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia (12/15 patients). CT images obtained before and after delivery showed no signs of\npneumonia aggravation after delivery. The four patients who were still pregnant at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had achieved good recovery. CONCLUSION.\nPregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia.

The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and\nthe hysteresis effects were discussed. Results: Compared the data from January 1 to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years, Hubei's SV for\ncough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001).

As of 31 January\n2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\nMETHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and\ndiscussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included\nin the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. RESULTS: Most of the publications were\nwritten using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused\non causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to\na seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks,\nhand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective;\nhence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early\nperiod, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the\ncurrent public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32183901", "Tag": ";epidemiology;(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32183864", "Title": "Safe patient transport for COVID-19.", "JournalName": "Critical care (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/21 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32183864", "Tag": ";(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32183357", "Title": "2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Paving the Road for Rapid Detection and Point-of-Care Diagnostics.", "JournalName": "Micromachines", "Creation Date": "2020/03/19 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 14", "Abstract": "We believe a point-of-care (PoC) device for the rapid detection of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial and urgently needed.

In order to control the spread of an epidemic,\nthe effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the\ndesign of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both\nmedical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the best locations\nof temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a\ncase study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the\ntime of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be\nan effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary incinerators is of significant importance.

The newly discovered coronavirus is similar to some beta-coronaviruses found in\nbats, but different from previously known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High sequence identities and similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV was found. In this work, we searched the homologous templates of all\nnonstructural and structural proteins of 2019-nCoV. Among the nonstructural proteins, the leader protein (nsp1), the papain-like protease (nsp3), the nsp4, the 3C-like protease (nsp5), the nsp7, the nsp8, the nsp9,\nthe nsp10, the RNA-directed RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase (nsp13), the guanine-N7 methyltransferase (nsp14), the uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (nsp15), the 2'-O-methyltransferase (nsp16), and the ORF7a protein could be built on the\nbasis of homology templates. Among the structural proteins, the spike protein (S-protein), the envelope protein (E-protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) can be constructed based on the crystal structures of\nthe proteins from SARS-CoV. It is known that PL-Pro, 3CL-Pro, and RdRp are important targets for design antiviral drugs against 2019-nCoV. And S protein is critical target candidate for inhibitor\nscreening or vaccine design against 2019-nCoV because coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of S protein to cell surface receptors.

The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS. One\nhundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range, 21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in\n65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein\nlevel was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five\nlobes in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had ground-glass opacity (GGO), and\n44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 patients [52%]).

Consequently, many countries have\nimplemented flight restrictions to China. China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province. However, whether these two enormous measures have\nled to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed available data on the development of confirmed domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after\nlockdown measures. We evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China before and after\nlockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9-2.6), to 4\ndays (95% CI: 3.5-4.3), after imposing lockdown. A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1-26.3), respectively. Moreover, the correlation between domestic air\ntraffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, p < 0.05 vs. after lockdown: r = 0.91, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly decreased growth\nrate and increased doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to\nhave a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32181488", "Tag": ";(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32181483", "Title": "Correlation between travellers departing from Wuhan before the Spring Festival and subsequent spread of COVID-19 to all provinces in China.", "JournalName": "Journal of travel medicine", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 17", "Abstract": "We found a strong correlation between travel volumes departing from Wuhan, Hubei Province before the Spring Festival and the extent of amplification of the outbreak of COVID-19 in China in\n2020, with 100 top cities.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans,\nlaboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the\nhealth status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of\nthe 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients\nreceived general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed.

The model allows for\nmany subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern\nHemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large,\nthe scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean\nthe epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.\nRESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was\nobserved (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (+/- SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation\ndepartment was 4.40 +/- 2.00 and 5.52 +/- 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and\npatients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results,\nGGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%)\n(p = 0.05).

Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport\nand storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination\nand testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.

This pathogenic virus has been identified in\nswabs performed on the throat and nose of patients who suffer from or are suspected of the disease. When COVI-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause\nmild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6. The binding of COVI-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release\nof pro-IL-1beta which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1beta which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Suppression of pro-inflammatory\nIL-1 family members and IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. Cytokine IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired\nimmune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on IL-18Ralpha receptor. IL-37 performs its immunosuppressive activity by acting on mTOR and increasing the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)\nkinase. This cytokine inhibits class II histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and inflammation in inflammatory diseases by suppressing MyD88 and subsequently IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF and CCL2. The suppression of IL-1beta by\nIL-37 in inflammatory state induced by coronavirus-19 can have a new therapeutic effect previously unknown. Another inhibitory cytokine is IL-38, the newest cytokine of the IL-1 family members, produced by\nseveral immune cells including B cells and macrophages.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 54 patients who admitted to Tongji hospital from February 3, 2020 to February 24, 2020 and met the criteria of severe\nor critical conditions of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and hospital mortality rate were analyzed and compared between the patients with or without myocardial injury, which was defined with 3 times\nhigher serum cardiac troponin value. Results: The median age of the 54 patients was 68 (59.8, 74.3) years. Among all the patients, 24 (44.4%) patients were complicated with hypertension, 13\n(24.1%) with diabetes, 8 (14.8%) with coronary heart disease, and 3 (5.6%) with previous cerebral infarction. During hospitalization, 24 (44.4%) of the patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26\n(48.1%) patients died in hospital.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of\npatients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. METHODS: In this retrospective,\nmulticentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (>/=18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died\nby Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We\nused univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were\nincluded in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed\nby diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.17,\nper year increase; p=0.0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5.65, 2.61-12.23; p<0.0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/L (18.42, 2.64-128.55; p=0.0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding\nwas 20.0 days (IQR 17.0-24.0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. INTERPRETATION: The potential\nrisk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/L could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding\nprovides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the\ninfection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission\nwith four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for\nsustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. METHODS: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in\nWuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the\nprobability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly\navailable datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by\ndate of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1,\n2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan\n29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries\nwith high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between\nJan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2.35 (95% CI 1.15-4.77) 1 week before travel restrictions\nwere introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1.05 (0.41-2.39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential\nto Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. INTERPRETATION: Our\nresults show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar\ntransmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force\nfor host cell recognition. METHODS: In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and\nstructural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. RESULTS: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have\nsequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain beta\n(SBDbeta). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDbeta of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. CONCLUSIONS: We\nreveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78.

Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19\npneumonia have not yet been well delineated. Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died. Design,\nSetting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The final\ndate of follow-up was February 13, 2020. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Main Outcomes and Measures: The development of ARDS and death. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data\nwere also collected and analyzed. Results: Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS,\nand of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and\n30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference,\n13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors\nassociated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia\n(HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95%\nCI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (>/=39 degrees C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development\n(HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95%\nCI, 0.20-0.72). Conclusions and Relevance: Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated\nwith the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524", "Tag": ";(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32167445", "Title": "COVID-19: Not a Simple Public Health Emergency.", "JournalName": "Prehospital and disaster medicine", "Creation Date": "2020/03/19 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167445", "Tag": ";epidemiology;(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32167181", "Title": "Initial clinical features of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 in two emergency departments outside of Hubei, China.", "JournalName": "Journal of medical virology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/14 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 13", "Abstract": "With an increasing number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases outside of Hubei, emergency departments (EDs) and fever clinics are facing challenges posed by the large number of admissions of\npatients suspected to have COVID-19.

To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using\nthe Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp.

However, 5,298 more patient were confirmed until 4-Mar. The\npurpose is to estimate and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures using mathematical modeling. Methods: Deterministic mathematical model(SEIHR) has been established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of confirmed\npatients in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province(Daegu/NGP), the main area of outbreak, were used. The first patient's symptom onset date was assumed on 22-Jan. We estimate the reproduction number(R), and\nthe effect of preventive measures, assuming that the effect has been shown from 29-Feb. or 5-Mar. Results: The estimated R in Hubei Province was 4.2655, while the estimated initial R\nin Korea was 0.5555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.4721 and 3.5428.

In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the\ndifferences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses.\nMETHODS: The genome composition, nucleotide analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage, and effective number of codons (ENc) were analyzed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E),\nmembrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important nonstructural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS,\nand SARS CoVs. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with\nG or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5 to 20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression\nefficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over-biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS,\nand MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope, and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat\nSARS, and MERS CoVs.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32159237", "Tag": ";(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32159234", "Title": "Identification of coronavirus sequences in carp cDNA from Wuhan, China.", "JournalName": "Journal of medical virology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/12 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 11", "Abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus sequences were identified in two separate complementary DNA (cDNA) pools.

The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population assumption. This model was built with the data and used\nto assess the detection rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true infections, detectable and detected cases.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies\nto reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of\npsychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020,\nwe conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and\nconcerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status\nwas assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact\nof the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.

Methods: The general conditions, biochemical\nindicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital\nwere retrospectively analyzed. The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared.

The\nprevious epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization\nof compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for\ntreating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. In addition, a combination of the human\nimmunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-INFb) were shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-INFb also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and\nmice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-INFb against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mice model. The relatively high mortality\nrates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, has suggested that pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis.

Limited data are available for pregnant women\nwith COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, and\nchest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n[SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the\npresence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation. FINDINGS: All nine patients\nhad a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two),\nand malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1.0 x 10(9) cells per L). Three patients had increased\naminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All\nnine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were\ntested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus. INTERPRETATION: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients\nwho developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19\npneumonia in late pregnancy.

In the last twenty years, several viral epidemics such as\nthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first\nidentified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area\nin China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019. Published literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the\nbeginning of December 2019. As they were unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases were classified as \"pneumonia of unknown etiology.\" The Chinese Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation program. The etiology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family. On\nFebruary 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a \"COVID-19,\" which is the acronym of \"coronavirus disease 2019\".\nIn the past twenty years, two additional coronavirus epidemics have occurred. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800\ndeaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases. This new virus seems to be very\ncontagious and has quickly spread globally. In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health\nEmergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission. An additional landmark occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case\nof the disease, not imported from China, was recorded in the United States. Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV. Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on\nTaxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs). The CoVs have become the major pathogens\nof emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. They are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species.[1] For reasons yet to be explained, these\nviruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. Interestingly, these latter viruses have\nprobably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts - the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV - before jumping to humans. The\ndynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it also has an animal origin. The potential for these viruses to grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems\nto be a serious public health risk. Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the \"very high\" level, on February 28, 2020. Probably, the effects\nof the epidemic caused by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving. On March 11, as the number of COVID-19 cases outside China has\nincreased 13 times and the number of countries involved has tripled with more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. World\ngovernments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating effects. Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat.\nAt the same time, scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly\ndeveloping. Many uncertainties remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its peak.\nAt the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community is our best weapon. Aggressive isolation measures\nin China have led to a progressive reduction of cases in the last few days. In Italy, in geographic regions of the north, initially, and subsequently throughout the peninsula, political\nand health authorities are making incredible efforts to contain a shock wave that is severely testing the health system. In the midst of the crisis, the authors have chosen to\nuse the \"Statpearls\" platform because, within the PubMed scenario, it represents a unique tool that may allow them to make updates in real-time. The aim, therefore, is to collect information\nand scientific evidence and to provide an overview of the topic that will be continuously updated.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150360", "Tag": ";italy[Title/Abstract];(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32150748", "Title": "The Incubation Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) From Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases: Estimation and Application.", "JournalName": "Annals of internal medicine", "Creation Date": "2020/03/10 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 10", "Abstract": "Background: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features,\nincluding the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of\nCOVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from\n50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible\nexposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation\nperiod was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6\ndays) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or\nquarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median\nincubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2,\nalthough longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares\nthe same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect\nof hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of\nhydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by\nintegrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the\ndrug's safety profile.

The virus has\nsince rapidly spread to all provinces and autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract\nsymptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected\npatients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol\n48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days)\nor a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4\nconsecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of\nhospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the\nthird serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past.\nHowever, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other\ntypes of severe respiratory disease.

However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those without\nsuch facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS:\nA 2019-nCoV related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing\nof ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit\ncytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified\nby quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and\nuses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 mumol/L. CEP\ndemonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 mumol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 mumol/L\nCEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 +/- 0.02] x 10vs. 1.00 +/- 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque\nassays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 mumol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00\n+/- 0.37 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.12, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 +/- 0.43 vs. [6.18 +/- 0.95] x 10, t = 3.98, P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection.

Methods: The epidemiological characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with confirmed\nCOVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response team. Results: There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign\ncountries: Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients), Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient). The early symptoms were fever, sore throat, cough or sputum production,\nchills, and muscle ache. Three patients were asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia. Of the 28 cases, 16 were index cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating\nin Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients. The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family members or acquaintances of primary\npatients, and the suspected sites of transmission were mostly at home.

Putative patients with COVID-19 have been identified in South Korea, and attempts have been made to isolate the pathogen from these\npatients. Methods: Upper and lower respiratory tract secretion samples from putative patients with COVID-19 were inoculated onto cells to isolate the virus. Full genome sequencing and electron microscopy were used\nto identify the virus. Results: The virus replicated in Vero cells and cytopathic effects were observed. Full genome sequencing showed that the virus genome exhibited sequence homology of more than\n99.9% with SARS-CoV-2 which was isolated from patients from other countries, for instance China. Sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was 77.5% and 50%, respectively. Coronavirus-specific morphology was\nobserved by electron microscopy in virus-infected Vero cells.

Epidemiological investigations were\nconducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic\ncarriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As\na result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases\nshowed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during\nhospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined\nas the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24\nasymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts\nwere prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization.

We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a\nsubset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.\nRESULTS: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the\nmost certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).

Clade\n1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus.\nTwo of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response\nsignaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model. Thus, we speculated that knowledge of the functional changes in the NS7b and NS8 proteins during evolution may provide important information to explore the\nhuman infective property of 2019-nCoV.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32142938", "Tag": ""}, {"PMID": "32142928", "Title": "Clinical and CT imaging features of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).", "JournalName": "The Journal of infection", "Creation Date": "2020/03/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32142928", "Tag": ""}, {"PMID": "32142886", "Title": "Effective strategies to prevent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in hospital.", "JournalName": "The Journal of hospital infection", "Creation Date": "2020/03/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32142886", "Tag": ""}, {"PMID": "32142651", "Title": "SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor.", "JournalName": "Cell", "Creation Date": "2020/03/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 4", "Abstract": "The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency.

COVID-19 is similar to Severe\nAcute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that\nCOVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein\nand surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has\nsimilar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19\nhas nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to\nSARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense.

The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS\nAND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT\nsigns of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square\ntest was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [+/- SD] age, 52.8\n+/- 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who\nhad their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level.\nMultiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score\nfor the upper zone (3.0 +/- 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 +/- 3.8) and lower (4.5 +/- 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p =\n0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area\n(4.4 +/- 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 +/- 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had\nground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural\nline; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms\nof pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (</= 7\ndays after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic\nstreaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\nshowed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT\nsigns of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area.

COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46%\nby far based on published data from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0-24 days. The\nbasic reproductive number (R0 ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2-3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China\nCDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing\nthe spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. 3019 health workers were infected by Feb 12, 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely\nburdened the health system, especially in Wuhan.

The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and\nmanagement of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This\nstudy included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with\nadenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included\nimages from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT\npatterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly\ndiagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation\nwith or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The \"reversed halo\" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign\nare uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19\ncompared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful\nas a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients.

It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus\ninteracts with other microorganisms in the lung. METHODS: We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight SARS-CoV-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 20 healthy\ncontrols. RESULTS: The median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was\nsimilar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). However, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved\nin the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants\nin a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. The microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated\nlevels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria.

The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and\nthe clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed\nimaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years\nold accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients\nwith COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction\nbronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%])\nand multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the\nseverity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation\nof the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to\nhave peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal.

In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage system was set up to identify\npatients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute conjunctivitis or recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these individuals to postpone their appointments for at least 14 days. Micro-aerosol generating procedures,\nsuch as non-contact tonometry and operations under general anaesthesia were avoided. Nasal endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing and cause generation of droplets. All elective clinical services were\nsuspended. Infection control training was provided to all clinical staff. Second, for environmental control, to reduce droplet transmission of COVID-19, installation of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent disinfection of\nequipment, and provision of eye protection to staff were implemented. All staff were advised to measure their own body temperatures before work and promptly report any symptoms of upper respiratory\ntract infection, vomiting or diarrhoea. Third, universal masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were promoted. CONCLUSION: We hope our initial experience in stepping up infection\ncontrol measures for COVID-19 infection in ophthalmology can help ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential community outbreak or pandemic. In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, ophthalmologists should work\nclosely with local infection control teams to implement infection control measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32124000", "Tag": ";(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32123989", "Title": "The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections in China: prevention, control and challenges.", "JournalName": "Intensive care medicine", "Creation Date": "2020/03/04 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123989", "Tag": ""}, {"PMID": "32123347", "Title": "The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2.", "JournalName": "Nature microbiology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/04 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123347", "Tag": ""}, {"PMID": "32122812", "Title": "Traditional Chinese medicine is a resource for drug discovery against 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).", "JournalName": "Journal of integrative medicine", "Creation Date": "2020/03/20 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122812", "Tag": ";(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32122469", "Title": "Anti-Chinese sentiment during the 2019-nCoV outbreak.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/17 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 29", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122469", "Tag": ";NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] ;epidemiology"}, {"PMID": "32122468", "Title": "On the use of corticosteroids for 2019-nCoV pneumonia.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 29", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122468", "Tag": ";NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32122430", "Title": "Identification of COVID-19 Can be Quicker through Artificial Intelligence framework using a Mobile Phone-Based Survey in the Populations when Cities/Towns Are Under Quarantine.", "JournalName": "Infection control and hospital epidemiology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/04 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 3", "Abstract": "We are proposing to use machine learning algorithms to be able to improve possible case identifications of COVID-19 more quicker when we use a mobile phone-based web survey.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 112 COVID-19 patients with\nCVD admitted to the western district of Union Hospital in Wuhan, from January 20, 2020 to February 15, 2020. They were divided into critical group (ICU, n=16) and general group\n(n=96) according to the severity of the disease and patients were followed up to the clinical endpoint. The observation indicators included total blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial blood gas\nanalysis, myocardial injury markers, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolyte, procalcitonin (PCT), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood lipid, pulmonary CT and pathogen detection.

Whether this strategy will achieve control\ndepends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from\nimported cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation\nof cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the\ndelay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation\nprevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks\nusing isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. FINDINGS: Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an\nR0 of 1.5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of\ninitial cases, when R0 was 2.5 or 3.5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5\nwere controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2.5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and\nfor an R0 of 3.5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak\nwas controllable when R0 was 1.5. For R0 values of 2.5 or 3.5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than\n1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months.\nThe probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to\nreflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

Five million people emigrated from Wuhan\nbefore lockdown, potentially representing a source of virus infection. Determining case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early stage of the epidemic is of great\nimportance for early warning and for the prevention of future outbreaks. METHODS: The official case report on the COVID-19 epidemic was collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location\ninformation on COVID-19 cases was extracted and analyzed using ArcGIS and WinBUGS software. Data on population migration from Wuhan city and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi, and their\ncorrelation with the number of cases was analyzed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in Hubei province accounted for 59.91% (5806/9692) and 95.77% (204/213) of the total cases in\nChina respectively. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan, which are adjacent to Hubei. The time risk of Hubei province on the following day was 1.960 times that on the\nprevious day. The number of cases in some cities was relatively low, but the time risk appeared to be continuously rising. The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases\nand emigration from Wuhan was up to 0.943. The lockdown of 17 cities in Hubei province and the implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented an exponential growth in the\nnumber of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The population that emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source in other cities and provinces. Some cities with a low number of cases showed a\nrapid increase in case load.

Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs,\nwith a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present\nin three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed\nthat the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection\nfrom oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P\n= 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11\ndays, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative\nresults (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral\nRNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild\ndisease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118639", "Tag": ";(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32118533", "Title": "COVID-19 in 2 Persons with Mild Upper Respiratory Symptoms on a Cruise Ship, Japan.", "JournalName": "Emerging infectious diseases", "Creation Date": "2020/03/03 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jun 17", "Abstract": "We describe 2 cases of COVID-19 in patients with mild upper respiratory symptoms.

While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection,\ndespite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on\nthe necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide\nstrategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant\nto any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\n(ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting\nimmunity. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate\nuse, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken.

METHODS: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature\nsearch for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the\nTraditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a\ndocking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing\nthe selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage.

METHODS: In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably\nbe bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to\npeople, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model.

While early cases of the disease were linked to a\nwet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations,\nand isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early\ngrowth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and\nassess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of\nHubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15\nday forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model.\nOur most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409-7496 additional confirmed\ncases in Hubei and 1128-1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei\nand 11,588-13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates\n(February 7th - 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the\nimaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled,\nincluding mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5\nyears) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate\nfever (<39.1 degrees C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine\nmild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22,\nright lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible\nextension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary\npresentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis.

On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was\nreported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25 January. By 4 February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine\nof non-ill passengers were implemented. By 20 February, 619 of 3,700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive. METHODS: We estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of\nthe outbreak using (SEIR) models. We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a\nmodel stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship.\nRESULTS: The basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the ${R}_0$ in the epicentre in Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled\ninitial ${R}_0$ of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected.\nIsolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with\n76 infected persons in their incubation time.

We aimed\nto describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two\nhospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan:\ngroup 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done </=1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks\nto 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. FINDINGS: 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020,\nwere retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49.5 years (SD 11.0). The mean number of involved lung segments was\n10.5 (SD 6.4) overall, 2.8 (3.3) in group 1, 11.1 (5.4) in group 2, 13.0 (5.7) in group 3, and 12.1 (5.9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality\nobserved was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In\ngroup 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity\npredominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21).

METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill\nadult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic\ndata, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020.\nSecondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. FINDINGS: Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult\npatients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59.7 (SD 13.3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61.5%)\npatients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors,\nnon-survivors were older (64.6 years [11.2] vs 51.9 years [12.9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30\n[94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.

This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar\nto those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not\nbreathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract\nand that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where\nthe brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the\nlung and lower respiratory airways.

Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent\nboth chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed.

Second, the observed dataset of\nreported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias\nand risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests.

However, if R0 value was reduced\nby 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981-1177) and 758 (697-817), respectively. CONCLUSION: The median with 95% CI of R0 of\nCOVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06-2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change\nof R0.

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of\nMedicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine,\nour team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on \"Four-Anti and Two-Balance\" for clinical practice. The \"Four-Anti and Two-Balance\"strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of\nwater, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes\nand chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute\nperiodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely\nidentifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The \"Four-Anti and Two-Balance\"strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness\nprogression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove\ninflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and\nalso short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation\nwas not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients\nwith long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as Lactobacillus and\nBifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the\nrisk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated\nChinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about\nviral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have\nbeen implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for\nCOVID-19.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32096367", "Tag": ";epidemiology;mortality;(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32096366", "Title": "[Dynamic changes of chest CT imaging in patients with corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19)].", "JournalName": "Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

METHODS: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of\nZhejiang University School of Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The shortest\ninterval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on\nthe CT images were reviewed. RESULTS: The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in\nthe lungs during the first CT examination. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air\nbronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During hospitalization, GGO lesions in\nCOVID-19 patients gradually became rare, the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after\nadmission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%).

Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal\nmarkets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability\nto infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and\nthe recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for\nseveral lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses\ncan recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094589", "Tag": ""}, {"PMID": "32094336", "Title": "High expression of ACE2 receptor of 2019-nCoV on the epithelial cells of oral mucosa.", "JournalName": "International journal of oral science", "Creation Date": "2020/03/19 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 24", "Abstract": "It has been reported that ACE2 is the main host cell receptor of 2019-nCoV and plays a crucial role in the entry of virus into the cell to cause the\nfinal infection.

We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with\nits natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide\nanalogues.

This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the\ngeneral public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV\nhad originated-Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total\nrate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial\nsupport and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective treatment\nof patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in policy formulation-public health experts, the government, and the general public.

Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa,\nEgypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African\ncountries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. METHODS: We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to\nAfrica to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations\nMonitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. FINDINGS: Countries with the highest\nimportation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya)\nhave variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city\nof Beijing, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised\nin countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.

METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms,\ntreatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS:\nInadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China\nand into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China\nis a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak\nduring the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that\nwe did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.

Methods: The correlation between ALT, AST and other liver\nenzyme changes condition and NCP patients' disease status reported in the literature was comprehensively analyzed. ACE2 expression in liver tissue for novel coronavirus was analyzed based on single cell sequencing\n(GSE115469) data. RNA-Seq method was used to analyze Ace2 expression and transcription factors related to its expression in liver tissues at various time-points after hepatectomy in mouse model of acute\nliver injury with partial hepatectomy. t-test or Spearman rank correlation analysis was used for statistical analysis. Results: ALT and AST were abnormally elevated in some patients with novel coronavirus infection,\nand the rate and extent of ALT and AST elevation in severe NCP patients were higher than those in non-severe patients. Liver tissue results of single cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry\nshowed that ACE2 was only expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of normal liver tissues, and very low in hepatocytes. In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial\nhepatectomy, Ace2 expression was down-regulated on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the normal level on the third day, and returned to normal level on\nseventh day when the liver recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. Whether this phenomenon suggests that the bile duct epithelial cells with positive expression of Ace2 participate in the process of\nliver regeneration after partial hepatectomy deserves further study. In RNA-Seq data, 77 transcription factors were positively correlated with the expression of ACE2 (r > 0.2, FDR < 0.05), which were\nmainly enriched in the development, differentiation, morphogenesis and cell proliferation of glandular epithelial cells.

METHODS: Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection,\nwere extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community-acquired\ncases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug\nhypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients\nand current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients.\nBlood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P < .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P < .001) patients after hospital admission.

Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were\nretrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: Among the 34 cases, 14 were males, and 20 were females. The median age was 8 years and 11 months. No patients had underlying diseases.\nThere were 28 children (82%) related with a family cluster outbreak. There were 26 children (76%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized\ninto different clinical types, including 22 (65%) common cases, 9 (26%) mild cases and 3 (8.8%) asymptomatic cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were\nfever (17 cases, 50%) and cough (13 cases, 38% ). In the 34 cases, the white blood cell counts of 28 cases (82%) were normal. Five cases had white blood\ncell counts more than 10x10(9)/L. One case had white blood cell counts less than 4x10(9)/L. Neutropenia and lymphopenia was found in one case, respectively.

By means of whole-genome sequence comparisons, we demonstrate that the noncoding flanks of the viral genome can be used to correctly separate\nthe recognized four betacoronavirus subspecies. The conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could, in theory, classify novel virus species into their subspecies. Only 253 upstream noncoding sequences\nof Sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus. Furthermore, it was investigated which bat species have commercial value in China, and would thus likely be\nhandled for trading purposes. A number of coronavirus genomes have been published that were obtained from such bat species. These bats are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and their handling\nposes a potential risk to cause zoonotic coronavirus epidemics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel\nBetacoronavirus species and correct identification of genetic relationships. Although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_nCoV, the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus\nremains as yet unknown.

This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and\nanalyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the\nrespiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics,\nand treatment regimens. RESULTS: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale\nMarket. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart\npalpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with\nmost chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective\ndrugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably,\nearly respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms\nto dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest\nimaging.

Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of\ninfluenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza.

Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection.

These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two\n2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least\nseven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control\nsamples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples,\nthereby allowing early identification of patients.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031583", "Tag": ";(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32031570", "Title": "Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/08 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 7", "Abstract": "Importance: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is\nlimited. Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan\nHospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological,\ndemographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster\nof health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median\nage was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40\n[29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 x 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1])\noccurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed\ntomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin,\n89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory\ndistress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to\nARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs\n51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%]\nvs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched\nto extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive\n(n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0).

Methods: 29 patients with\n2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 were selected as the study subjects.\nClinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three\ngroups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the\nchanges of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of\n2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients\nshowed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin. In most patients,serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was\nsignificantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased(15/29). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT findings of\ntypical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow\ncoexists with the solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the\nthree groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mildgroup. However, there were no statistically significant differences\nin serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05).

METHODS: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The\nnumber of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\n(SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. RESULTS: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential\ngrowth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403-540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was\nlikely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18-25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.

Cases have been exported to other\nChinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the\nnumber of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical\nprevention interventions. METHODS: We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec\n25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted\nthe national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly\nflight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were\nobtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A\nsusceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using\nthe resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). FINDINGS: In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2.68 (95% CrI 2.47-2.86) and that\n75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8-7.1). We estimated\nthat in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\nIf the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time\nbehind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas\nwith close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in\nmajor cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied\nfor quick deployment globally.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative\npathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or\nvisiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. METHODS: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited\nthe Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with\nthe terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the\nvirus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the\nnine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99.98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and\nbat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus\nof the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had\na similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting\nbetacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host\nfacilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.

We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR\nand were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49\n(49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55.5 years (SD 13.1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was\ndetected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31\n[31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea\n(two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and\none (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple\norgan failure. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such\nas acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further\ninvestigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

Our objectives were to\ncharacterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. METHODS: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant\nphylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13\nsequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5'-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3'-part spanning 24,341-30,696\npositions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3'-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike\nregions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does\nnot provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.

Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in\n2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species\nand human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the\nsequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several\ncritical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly\nAsn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of\n2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections.\nThese analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.IMPORTANCE The recent\nemergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by\nSARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the\ngoals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models\nof viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This\nstudy provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31996437", "Tag": ";epidemiology"}, {"PMID": "31995857", "Title": "Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia.", "JournalName": "The New England journal of medicine", "Creation Date": "2020/01/30 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 26", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed\ncases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS: We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been\nreported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling\ntime and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS: Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%)\nwith onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95%\nconfidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a\nmean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).

Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope,\nMembrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40%\namino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with\na beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would\nbe important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design\nof diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31987001", "Tag": ""}, {"PMID": "31986264", "Title": "Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/14 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 15", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics\nand treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients\nwith laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection\nConsortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted\nto the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of\nthe infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median\nage was 49.0 years (IQR 41.0-58.0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were\nfever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38),\nhaemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8.0 days [IQR 5.0-13.0]).\n26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute\ncardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma\nlevels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFalpha. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was\nassociated with ICU admission and high mortality.

Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as\na potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. METHODS: In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of\nfive patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did\nnot travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. FINDINGS: From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan\nfrom Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family\nmember, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts\nwith Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or\na combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child\n(aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate\ndehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were\nRT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients'\nRT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in\nChinese horseshoe bats.

We investigated exposure to nitrogen oxides (NOX) as a whole and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) specifically,\nas well as PM10, and PM2.5, during childhood and subsequent schizophrenia risk. METHODS: People born in Denmark from 1980 to 1984 (N=230 844), who were residing in the country on\ntheir tenth birthday, and who had two Danish-born parents were followed-up from their tenth birthday until schizophrenia diagnosis or Dec 31, 2016. Mean daily exposure to each pollutant (NO2, NOX,\nPM10, and PM2.5) at all of an individual's residential addresses from birth to their tenth birthday was modelled. Incidence rate ratios, cumulative incidence, and population attributable risks were calculated using\nsurvival analysis techniques. FINDINGS: We analysed data between Aug 1, 2018, and Nov 15, 2019. Of 230 844 individuals included, 2189 cohort members were diagnosed with schizophrenia during follow-up. Higher\nconcentrations of residential NO2 and NOX exposure during childhood were associated with subsequent elevated schizophrenia risk. People exposed to daily mean concentrations of more than 26.5 mug/m(3) NO2 had a\n1.62 (95% CI 1.41-1.87) times increased risk compared with people exposed to a mean daily concentration of less than 14.5 mug/m(3). The absolute risks of developing schizophrenia by the age\nof 37 years when exposed to daily mean concentrations of more than 26.5 mug/m(3) NO2 between birth and 10 years were 1.45% (95% CI 1.30-1.62%) for men and 1.03% (0.90-1.17)\nfor women, whereas when exposed to a mean daily concentration of less than 14.5 mug/m(3), the risk was 0.80% (95% CI 0.69-0.92%) for men and 0.67% (0.57-0.79) for women. Associations\nbetween exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 and schizophrenia risk were less consistent. INTERPRETATION: If the association between air pollution and schizophrenia is causal, reducing ambient air pollution including NO2 and\nNOX could have a potentially considerable effect on lowering schizophrenia incidence at the population level. Further investigations are necessary to establish a causal relationship.

We aimed to\nassess spatial and temporal trends in community-reported needs and associations with behaviour change, community engagement, and the overall outbreak situation in Sierra Leone. METHODS: We did a retrospective, mixed-methods study.\nPost-hoc analyses of data from 12 096 mobiliser visits as part of the Social Mobilization Action Consortium were used to describe the evolution of satisfied and unsatisfied needs (basic, security,\nautonomy, respect, and social support) between Nov 12, 2014, and Dec 18, 2015, and across 14 districts. Via Bayesian hierarchical regression modelling, we investigated associations between needs categories and behaviours\n(numbers of individuals referred to treatment within 24 h of symptom onset or deaths responded to with safe and dignified burials) and the role of community engagement programme status (initial\nvs follow-up visit) in the association between satisfied versus unsatisfied needs and behaviours. FINDINGS: In general, significant associations were observed between unsatisfied needs categories and both prompt referrals to treatment\nand safe burials. Most notably, communities expressing unsatisfied capacity needs reported fewer safe burials (relative risk [RR] 0.86, 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.82-0.91) and fewer prompt referrals to treatment (RR\n0.76, 0.70-0.83) than did those without unsatisfied capacity needs. The exception was expression of unsatisfied basic needs, which was associated with significantly fewer prompt referrals only (RR 0.86, 95% CrI\n0.79-0.93). Compared with triggering visits by community mobilisers, follow-up visits were associated with higher numbers of prompt referrals (RR 1.40, 95% CrI 1.30-1.50) and safe burials (RR 1.08, 1.02-1.14).

We developed a system to\nclassify pesticide risks and hazards with respect to human and environmental health and produce a minimum (lower risk) pesticide list. METHODS: We classified 659 pesticides by acute and chronic risks\nto human health (eg, respiratory and carcinogenic effects) and by environmental risks, including biomagnification and atmospheric ozone depletion and risks to aquatic life, terrestrial wildlife, and pollinators. From this analysis,\nwe produced a guideline for selection of lower risk pesticides. The classification of highly hazardous and high-risk compounds has been tested in more than a million farm households in the\ntropics, and in US integrated pest management (IPM) programmes. The full classification, including the minimum pesticide list, has been used in management of the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) throughout Africa\nand Asia. FINDINGS: Our analysis developed a stand-alone guideline for selection of lower risk pesticides. When classifying pesticides in current use against the fall armyworm in Africa, our guideline identified\nchemicals that are effective and of lower risk to human and environmental health. We argue that a minimum (lower risk) pesticides list, which meets IPM needs, could be developed from\nour classification system.

City and urban designs might play a role in mitigating the\nglobal burden of road transport injury to an extent that has not been captured by traditional safe system approaches. We aimed to determine the relationship between urban design and road\ntrauma across the globe. METHODS: Applying a combined convolutional neural network and graph-based approach, 1692 cities capturing one third of the world's population were classified into types based on urban\ndesign characteristics represented in sample maps. Associations between identified city types, characteristics contained within sample maps, and the burden of road transport injury as measured by disability adjusted life-years were\nestimated through univariate and multivariate analyses, controlling for the influence of economic activity. FINDINGS: Between Mar 1, 2017, and Dec 24, 2018, nine global city types based on a final\nsample of 1632 cities were identified. Burden of road transport injury was an estimated two-times higher (risk ratio 2.05, 95% CI 1.84-2.27) for the poorest performing city type compared with\nthe best performing city type, culminating in an estimated loss of 8.71 (8.08-9.25) million disability-adjusted life-years per year attributable to suboptimal urban design. City types that featured a greater proportion\nof railed public transport networks combined with dense road networks characterised by smaller blocks showed the lowest rates of road traffic injury. INTERPRETATION: This study highlights the important role that\ncity and urban design plays in mitigating road transport injury burden at a global scale. It is recommended that road and transport safety efforts promote urban design that features characteristics\ninherent in identified high-performance city types including higher density road infrastructure and high rates of public transit.

Planetary health", "Creation Date": "2020/01/31 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: PM2.5 is an important but modifiable environmental risk factor, not only for pulmonary diseases and cancers, but for cardiovascular health. However, the evidence regarding the association between air pollution\nand acute cardiac events, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), is inconsistent, especially at concentrations lower than the WHO daily guideline (25 mug/m(3)). This study aimed to determine the associations\nbetween exposure to ambient air pollution and the incidence of OHCA. METHODS: In this nationwide case-crossover study, we linked prospectively collected population-based registry data for OHCA in Japan from Jan\n1, 2014, to Dec 31, 2015, with daily PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), photochemical oxidants (Ox), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) exposure on the day of the arrest (lag\n0) or 1-3 days before the arrest (lags 1-3), as well as the moving average across days 0-1 and days 0-3. Daily exposure was calculated by averaging the measurements from\nall PM2.5 monitoring stations in the same prefecture. The effect of PM2.5 on risk of all-cause or cardiac OHCA was estimated using a time-stratified case-crossover design coupled with conditional logistic\nregression analysis, adjusted for daily temperature and relative humidity. Single-pollutant models were also investigated for the individual gaseous pollutants (CO, NO2, Ox, and SO2), as well as two-pollutant models for\nPM2.5 with these gaseous pollutants. Subgroup analyses were done by sex and age. FINDINGS: Over the 2 years, 249 372 OHCAs were identified, with 149 838 (60.1%) presumed of cardiac\norigin. The median daily PM2.5 was 11.98 mug/m(3) (IQR 8.13-17.44). Each 10 mug/m(3) increase in PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of all-cause OHCA on the same day (odds ratio\n[OR] 1.016, 95% CI 1.009-1.023) and at lags of up to 3 days, ranging from OR 1.015 (1.008-1.022) at lag 1 to 1.033 (1.023-1.043) at lag 0-3. Results for cardiac\nOHCA were similar (ORs ranging from 1.016 [1.007-1.025] at lags 1 and 2 to 1.034 [1.021-1.047] at lag 0-3). Patients older than 65 years were more susceptible to PM2.5 exposure\nthan younger age groups but no sex differences were identified. CO, Ox, and SO2 were also positively associated with OHCA while NO2 was not. However, in two-pollutant models of PM2.5\nand gaseous pollutants, only PM2.5 (positive association) and NO2 (negative association) were independently associated with increased risk of OHCA. INTERPRETATION: Short-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk\nof OHCA even at relatively low concentrations. Regulatory standards and targets need to incorporate the potential health gains from continual air quality improvement even in locations already meeting WHO standards.\nFUNDING: None.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31999950", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31999948", "Title": "Australia burning.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

In this study, we assess the role of historical redlining as\noutlined in security maps created by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), the discriminatory practice of categorising neighbourhoods on the basis of perceived mortgage investment risk, on the burden of\nasthma in these neighbourhoods. METHODS: We did an ecological study of HOLC risk grades and asthma exacerbations in California using the security maps available for the following eight cities: Fresno,\nLos Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, and Stockton. Each census tract was categorised into one of four risk levels (A, B, C, or D) on the\nbasis of the location of population-weighted centroids on security maps, with the worst risk level (D) indicating historical redlining. We obtained census tract-level rates of emergency department visits due to\nasthma from CalEnviroScreen 3.0. We assessed the relationship between risk grade and log-transformed asthma visit rates between 2011 and 2013 using ordinary least squares regression. We included potential confounding variables\nfrom the 2010 Census and CalEnviroScreen 3.0: diesel exhaust particle emissions, PM2.5, and percent of the population living below 2 times the federal poverty level. We also built random intercept\nand slope models to assess city-level variation in the relationship between redlining and asthma. FINDINGS: In the 1431 census tracts assessed (64 [4.5%] grade A, 241 [16.8%] grade B, 719\n[50.2%] grade C, and 407 [28.4%] grade D), the proportion of the population that was non-Hispanic black and Hispanic, the percentage of the population living in poverty, and diesel exhaust\nparticle emissions all significantly increased as security map risk grade worsened (p<0.0001). The median age-adjusted rates of emergency department visits due to asthma were 2.4 times higher in census tracts\nthat were previously redlined (median 63.5 [IQR 34.3] visits per 10 000 residents per year [2011-13]) than in tracts at the lowest risk level (26.5 [18.4]). In adjusted models, redlined\ncensus tracts were associated with a relative risk of 1.39 (95% CI 1.21-1.57) in rates of emergency department visits due to asthma compared with that of lowest-risk census tracts. INTERPRETATION:\nHistorically redlined census tracts have significantly higher rates of emergency department visits due to asthma, suggesting that this discriminatory practice might be contributing to racial and ethnic asthma health disparities.\nFUNDING: National Heart Lung Blood Institute.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31999951", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31999949", "Title": "Planetary health research digest.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

Differentiation of acute appendicitis from conditions that do not require operative management can be challenging in children. This study\naimed to identify the optimum risk prediction model to stratify acute appendicitis risk in children. METHODS: We did a rapid review to identify acute appendicitis risk prediction models. A prospective,\nmulticentre cohort study was then done to evaluate performance of these models. Children (aged 5-15 years) presenting with acute right iliac fossa pain in the UK and Ireland were included.\nFor each model, score cutoff thresholds were systematically varied to identify the best achievable specificity while maintaining a failure rate (ie, proportion of patients identified as low risk who had\nacute appendicitis) less than 5%. The normal appendicectomy rate was the proportion of resected appendixes found to be normal on histopathological examination. FINDINGS: 15 risk prediction models were identified that\ncould be assessed. The cohort study enrolled 1827 children from 139 centres, of whom 630 (34.5%) underwent appendicectomy. The normal appendicectomy rate was 15.9% (100 of 630 patients). The Shera\nscore was the best performing model, with an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.82-0.86). Applying score cutoffs of 3 points or lower for children aged 5-10 years\nand girls aged 11-15 years, and 2 points or lower for boys aged 11-15 years, the failure rate was 3.3% (95% CI 2.0-5.2; 18 of 539 patients), specificity was 44.3%\n(95% CI 41.4-47.2; 521 of 1176), and positive predictive value was 41.4% (38.5-44.4; 463 of 1118). Positive predictive value for the Shera score with a cutoff of 6 points or\nlower (72.6%, 67.4-77.4) was similar to that of ultrasound scan (75.0%, 65.3-83.1). INTERPRETATION: The Shera score has the potential to identify a large group of children at low risk of\nacute appendicitis who could be considered for early discharge. Risk scoring does not identify children who should proceed directly to surgery. Medium-risk and high-risk children should undergo routine preoperative ultrasound\nimaging by operators trained to assess for acute appendicitis, and MRI or low-dose CT if uncertainty remains.

To date, this spectrum of effects and its clinical implications\nhave not been completely described. We describe the neurological examination findings in toddlers and preschoolers, including predominant symptom complexes and comorbidities. METHODS: This study is a case-series neurological evaluation of\n75 children with congenital Zika syndrome in Campina Grande, Brazil. The study is part of a cohort of children with congenital Zika syndrome that started in 2015 and is still\nongoing. Children with Zika virus infection detected during pregnancy (mothers exhibited rash and were followed and diagnosed by fetal ultrasound abnormalities or RT-PCR) or through microcephaly screening after birth, using\nIntergrowth 21 guidelines, were selected by laboratory and radiological criteria. Children were examined during a 10-day period in September, 2018, and underwent neurological interview, examination, and assessment of functional outcomes\nand comorbidities. Children were divided in groups of predominant corticospinal or neuromuscular clinical signs and the associations between these groups and clinical comorbidities were assessed. FINDINGS: All of the children\nrecruited to the study from Nov 29, 2015 to Nov 30, 2017 had imaging correlates of congenital Zika syndrome. Children were assigned to groups depending on the signs exhibited, either\ncorticospinal or neuromuscular, with or without dyskinetic signs. 75 children completed the evaluation, 38 (51%) girls and 37 (49%) boys. Median age was 33 months (range 26-40 months; IQR 29-34).\nMicrocephaly was present at birth in 56 (75%) children, and 19 (25%) children were born with normal head circumference, 15 of whom later developed microcephaly. Neurological examination grouped four children\nas having isolated dyskinetic signs, 48 children were assigned to the corticospinal group and 23 into the neuromuscular group. Dyskinetic findings were present in 30 (40%) children, either alone (four\n[5%]) or combined with corticospinal (19 [40%] of 48) or neuromuscular (seven [30%] of 23) findings. Comorbidities were highly prevalent, and the neuromuscular group had worse functional outcomes, evaluated by\ngross motor function (p=0.026), manual abilities (p=0.0013), and communication function (p<0.0005) classification scales, than the corticospinal group, whereas pneumonia (p<0.0005) and urinary tract infections (p<0.0005) were more frequent in the\ncorticospinal group. Cortical hyperexcitability was supported by several clinical correlates, such as early onset epilepsy, persistence of primitive reflexes, and dystonia. INTERPRETATION: We describe distinct neurological profiles in the congenital\nZika syndrome spectrum, with functional outcomes tending to correlate with these groups. The clinical division of children based on the disease signs proposed here is supported by the literature on\ncentral and peripheral nervous system pathology in congenital Zika syndrome. The high prevalence of dyskinetic symptoms merits special attention.

Existing neonatal mortality risk scores have primarily been\ndeveloped for high-resource settings. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a score that is practicable for low-income and middle-income countries to predict in-hospital mortality among neonates\nborn weighing 2000 g or less using datasets from the UK and The Gambia. METHODS: This analysis used retrospective data held in the UK National Neonatal Research Database from 187\nneonatal units, and data from the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital (EFSTH), Banjul, The Gambia. In the UK dataset, neonates were excluded if birthweight was more than 2000 g; if\nthe neonate was admitted aged more than 6 h or following discharge; if the neonate was stillborn; if the neonate died in delivery room; or if they were moribund on\nadmission. The Gambian dataset included all neonates weighing less than 2000 g who were admitted between May 1, 2018, and Sept 30, 2019, who were screened for but not enrolled\nin the Early Kangaroo Mother Care Trial. 18 studies were reviewed to generate a list of 84 potential parameters. We derived a model to score in-hospital neonatal mortality risk using\ndata from 55 029 admissions to a random sample of neonatal units in England and Wales from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2016. All candidate variables were included in\na complete multivariable model, which was progressively simplified using reverse stepwise selection. We validated the new score (NMR-2000) on 40 329 admissions to the remaining units between the same dates\nand 14 818 admissions to all units from Jan 1, to Dec 31, 2017. We also validated the score on 550 neonates admitted to the EFSTH in The Gambia. FINDINGS:\n18 candidate variables were selected for inclusion in the modelling process. The final model included three parameters: birthweight, admission oxygen saturation, and highest level of respiratory support within 24 h\nof birth. NMR-2000 had very good discrimination and goodness-of-fit across the UK samples, with a c-index of 0.8859-0.8930 and a Brier score of 0.0232-0.0271. Among Gambian neonates, the model had\na c-index of 0.8170 and a Brier score of 0.1688. Predictive ability of the simplified integer score was similar to the model using regression coefficients, with c-indices of 0.8903 in\nthe UK full validation sample and 0.8082 in the Gambian validation sample. INTERPRETATION: NMR-2000 is a validated mortality risk score for hospitalised neonates weighing 2000 g or less in settings\nwhere pulse oximetry is available. The score is accurate and simplified for bedside use. NMR-2000 requires further validation using a larger dataset from low-income and middle-income countries but has the\npotential to improve individual and population-level neonatal care resource allocation.

Transport of children in need of specialised trauma care to lower-level trauma centres is associated\nwith adverse patient outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of paediatric field triage based on patient destination and triage tools. METHODS: We did a multisite observational study (P2-T2)\nof all children (aged <16 years) transported with high priority by ambulance from the scene of injury to any emergency department in seven of 11 inclusive trauma regions in the\nNetherlands. Diagnostic accuracy based on the initial transport destination was evaluated in terms of undertriage rate (ie, the proportion of patients in need of specialised trauma care who were initially\ntransported to a lower-level paediatric or adult trauma centre) and overtriage rate (ie, the proportion of patients not requiring specialised trauma care who were transported to a level-I [highest level]\npaediatric trauma centre). The Dutch National Protocol of Ambulance Services and Field Triage Decision Scheme triage protocols were externally validated using data from this cohort against an anatomical (Injury Severity\nScore [ISS] >/=16) and a resource-based reference standard. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2017, 12 915 children (median age 10.3 years, IQR 4.2-13.6) were transported to the\nemergency department with injuries. 4091 (31.7%) patients were admitted to hospital, of whom 129 (3.2%) patients had an ISS of 16 or greater and 227 (5.5%) patients used critical resources\nwithin a limited timeframe. Ten patients died within 24 h of arrival at the emergency department. Based on the primary reference standard (ISS >/=16), the undertriage rate was 16.3% (95%\nCI 10.8-23.7) and the overtriage rate was 21.2% (20.5-22.0). The National Protocol of Ambulance Services had a sensitivity of 53.5% (95% CI 43.9-62.9) and a specificity of 94.0% (93.4-94.6), and\nthe Field Triage Decision Scheme had a sensitivity of 64.5% (54.1-74.1) and a specificity of 84.3% (83.1-85.5). INTERPRETATION: Too many children in need of specialised care were transported to lower-level\npaediatric or adult trauma centres, which is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Current protocols cannot accurately discriminate between patients at low and high risk, and highly sensitive and child-specific\ntriage tools need to be developed to ensure the right patient is transported to the right hospital.

However, few longitudinal studies have assessed such associations in children of preschool age (0-6 years)\nand none have accounted for the compositional nature of these behaviours. We aimed to investigate the associations between total and device-specific screen viewing time at age 2-3 years and accelerometer-measured\n24 h movement behaviours, including sleep, sedentary behaviour, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at age 5.5 years. METHODS: The Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO)\nstudy is an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort study in Singapore, which began in June 2009. We recruited pregnant women during their first ultrasound scan visit at two major public maternity\nunits in Singapore. At clinic visits done at age 2-3 years, we collected parent-reported information about children's daily total and device-specific screen viewing time (television, handheld devices, and computers). At\n5.5 years, children's movement behaviours for 7 consecutive days were measured using wrist-worn accelerometers. We assessed the associations between screen viewing time and movement behaviours (sedentary behaviour, light physical activity,\nMVPA, and sleep) using Dirichlet regression, which accounts for the compositional nature of such behaviours.

Total screen viewing time at age 2-3 years had a significant negative association with sleep (p=0.008), light physical activity (p<0.0001), and MVPA (p<0.0001) in relation to sedentary behaviour at\nage 5.5 years. Compared with children who spent 1 h or less per day screen viewing at age 2-3 years, children who screen viewed for 3 h or more per\nday at 2-3 years engaged in more sedentary behaviour (439.8 mins per day [</=1 h screen viewing time] vs 480.0 mins per day [>/=3 h screen viewing time]), and less\nlight physical activity (384.6 vs 356.2 mins per day), and MVPA (76.2 vs 63.4 mins per day) at age 5.5 years. No significant differences in time spent sleeping were observed\nbetween the groups (539.5 vs 540.4 mins per day). Similar trends were observed for television viewing and handheld device viewing. INTERPRETATION: Longer screen viewing time in children aged 2-3 years\nwas associated with more time spent engaged in sedentary behaviour and shorter time engaged in light physical activity and MVPA in later childhood. Our findings indicate that screen viewing might\ndisplace physical activity during early childhood, and suggest that reducing screen viewing time in early childhood might promote healthier behaviours and associated outcomes later in life.

Despite the barriers to legal gender\naffirmation for trans people, little is known about its association with mental health. We therefore sought to determine whether having gender-concordant identity documents (IDs) is associated with mental health among\ntrans adults in the USA. We hypothesised that having an ID that reflects one's preferred name and gender marker would be associated with reduced psychological distress and suicide risk. METHODS:\nIn this cross-sectional observational study, we obtained data from the 2015 US Transgender Survey, the largest cross-sectional survey of trans adults in the USA, with 27 715 participants. Eligible participants\nwere adults (>/=18 years), residing in a US state, territory, or overseas US military base; and considered themselves transgender, trans, genderqueer, non-binary, or similar. We excluded participants not living day-to-day\nin a different gender to the sex they were assigned at birth, participants who identified as crossdressers, and those missing data. The primary exposure of interest was whether all or\nsome (vs none) of a respondent's IDs reflected their preferred name and gender marker. We examined associations with psychological distress (measured with the Kessler 6 scale) and suicide ideation, planning,\nand attempts in the past year, which we analysed using linear and modified Poisson regression models to examine associations with respondents' IDs. FINDINGS: Of 22 286 respondents included in our\nanalytic sample, 10 288 (weighted percentage 45.1%) had their preferred name and gender marker on none, 9666 (44.2%) on some, and 2332 (10.7%) on all of their IDs. Compared with\nthose with no gender-concordant ID, respondents for whom all IDs were concordant had lower prevalence of serious psychological distress (adjusted prevalence ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.61-0.76), suicidal ideation (0.78, 0.72-0.85),\nand suicide planning (0.75, 0.64-0.87), adjusting for potential confounders. Having some versus no concordant ID was generally associated with smaller reductions in distress and suicidality. Gender-concordant ID was not associated\nwith suicide attempts (eg, adjusted prevalence ratio for all vs no IDs was 0.92, 95% CI 0.68-1.24). INTERPRETATION: Possession of gender-concordant IDs might improve mental health among trans persons. Gender\nrecognition policies should be considered structural determinants of transgender health.

Income is a key health determinant, and a basic income could affect health through its effect on other determinants,\nsuch as employment. However, there is little evidence of its potential effects on public health, because no studies of interventions which meet the definition of basic income have been done.\nHowever, there is evidence from studies of interventions with similarities to basic income. Therefore, we aimed to identify these studies and to consider what can be learned from them about\nthe potential effects of such interventions on health and socioeconomic outcomes. We did a systematic scoping review of basic income-like interventions, searching eight bibliographic and eight specialist databases from inception\nto July, 2019, with extensive hand searching. We included publications in English of quantitative and qualitative studies done in upper-middle-income or high-income countries, of universal, permanent, or subsistence-level interventions providing\nunconditional payments to individuals or families. We sought to identify the range of outcomes reported by relevant studies, and report health, education, employment, and social outcomes. We extracted and tabulated\nrelevant data and narratively reported effects by intervention and outcome. We identified 27 studies of nine heterogeneous interventions, some universal and permanent, and many evaluated using randomised controlled trials or\nrobust quasi-experimental methods. Evidence on health effects was mixed, with strong positive effects on some outcomes, such as birthweight and mental health, but no effect on others. Employment effects were\ninconsistent, although mostly small for men and larger for women with young children. There was evidence of spill-over effects in studies measuring effects on large populations. In conclusion, little evidence\nexists of large reductions in employment, and some evidence suggests positive effects on some other outcomes, including health outcomes.

Public health", "Creation Date": "2020/03/03 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The unequal distribution of income is a fundamental determinant of health inequalities. Decision making around economic policies could be enhanced by showing their potential health effects. We used scenario\nmodelling to assess the effects of 12 income-based policies on years of life lost (YLL) and inequalities in YLL in Scotland for the 2017-21 period. METHODS: In this modelling study,\nwe used EUROMOD version H1.0+, a tax-benefit microsimulation model, to estimate the effects of hypothetical fiscal policies on household income for Scottish households in the 2014/15 Family Resources Survey (n=2871).\nThe effects were modelled excluding housing costs. Income change from baseline was estimated for each quintile of the 2016 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) after weighting to account for\ndifferential non-response to the Family Resources Survey, and incomes were equivalised according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's modified equivalence scale. A regression analysis of cross-sectional data was\nused to estimate the relationship between income change and all-cause mortality, followed up by a sensitivity analysis to account for uncertainties around the assumptions on effect size. Informing Interventions to\nreduce health Inequalities (Triple I), a health inequalities scenario modelling tool, was used to estimate policy effects on YLL and government spending after five years of theoretical implementation. The Triple\nI model used population estimates for 2016 stratified by sex, 5-year age group, and SIMD quintile, which were obtained from the National Records of Scotland. Preliminary estimates of relative policy\ncosts were calculated from the EUROMOD-derived combined effects of each policy on tax bills, National Insurance contributions, and benefits receipts for Scottish households. FINDINGS: Taxation-based policies did not substantially affect\nhousehold incomes, whereas benefits-based policies had large effects across the quintiles. The best policy for improving health and narrowing health inequalities was a 50% increase to means-tested benefits (approximately 105\n177 [4.7%] YLL fewer than the baseline of 2.2 million, and a 7.9% reduction in relative index of inequality). Effects on YLL and health inequalities were inversely correlated in response\nto changes in taxation policy. Citizen's Basic Income (CBI) schemes also substantially narrowed inequalities (3.7% relative index of inequality for basic scheme, 5.9% for CBI with additional payments for individuals\nwith disability), and modestly reduced YLL (0.7% for the basic scheme and 1.4% with additional payments). The estimated government spending associated with a policy was proportional to its effect on\nYLL, but less closely related to its effect on inequalities in YLL. INTERPRETATION: Policies that affect incomes could potentially have marked effects on health and health inequalities in Scotland. Our\nprojections suggest that the most effective policies for reducing health inequalities appeared to be those that disproportionately increased incomes in the most deprived areas. Although modelling was subject to various\nassumptions, the approach can be useful to inform decisions around addressing the upstream determinants of health inequalities.

Since its publication in 1994, major treatment advances with possible effects on QOL have occurred. These changes called for\nan update of the module and its international psychometric validation. We aimed to investigate the scale structure and psychometric properties of the updated lung cancer module, QLQ-LC29, in patients with\nlung cancer. METHODS: This international, observational field study was done in 19 hospitals across 12 countries. Patients aged older than 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer and\nno other previous primary tumour, and who were mentally fit with sufficient language skills to understand and complete the questionnaire were included. Patients were asked during a hospital visit to\nfill in the paper versions of the core questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 plus QLQ-LC29, and investigators selected half of these patients to complete the questionnaire again 2-4 weeks later. Our primary\naim was to assess the scale structure and psychometric properties of EORTC QLQ-LC29. We analysed scale structure using confirmatory factor analysis; reliability using Cronbach's alpha value (internal consistency) and intra-class\ncoefficient (test-retest reliability); sensitivity using independent t tests stratified by Karnofsky performance status; and responsiveness to change over time by ANOVA. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02745691. FINDINGS: Between\nApril 12, 2016, and Sept 26, 2018, 523 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of either non-small-cell lung cancer (n=442) or small-cell lung cancer (n=81) were recruited. Confirmatory factor analysis provided\na solution composed of five multi-item scales (coughing, shortness of breath, fear of progression, hair problems, and surgery-related symptoms) plus 15 single symptom or side-effect items: chi(2)=370.233, root mean square\nerror of approximation=0.075, and comparative-fit index=0.901. Cronbach's alpha for internal consistencies of all multi-item scales were above the threshold of 0.70. Intra-class coefficients for test-retest reliabilities ranged between 0.82 and\n0.97. Three (shortness of breath, fear of progression, and hair problems) of the five multi-item scales showed responsiveness to change over time (p values <0.05), as did nine of 15\nsingle symptom items. Four (coughing, shortness of breath, fear of progression, and surgery-related symptoms) of the five multi-item scales and ten of the 15 single symptom items were sensitive to\nknown group differences (ie, lower vs higher Karnofsky performance status).

Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for\npatients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and\nserum antibody responses. METHODS: We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva,\nand rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD)\nwere measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. FINDINGS: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion,\nof whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37-75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5.2 log10 copies per\nmL (IQR 4.1-7.0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope -0.15, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.11; R(2)=0.71). In one\npatient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's rho=0.48, 95% CI 0.074-0.75; p=0.020). For 16 patients with serum samples\navailable 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for\nanti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R(2)>0.9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. INTERPRETATION: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive\nspecimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature\nof this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.

We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful. METHODS: We adapted an influenza epidemic\nsimulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number\nof SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R0] of 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5) and assuming 7.5%\nof infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline\nscenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as\nquarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering\nthe asymptomatic fraction of infections (22.7%, 30.0%, 40.0%, and 50.0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures. FINDINGS: For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1.5, the median\ncumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000-320 000), corresponding to 7.4% (IQR 6.5-8.5) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections\nincreased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000-776 000) when R0 was 2.0, corresponding to 19.3% (17.8-20.6) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000-1\n249 000) when R0 was 2.5, corresponding to 32% (30.9-33.1) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median\nnumber of infections by 99.3% (IQR 92.6-99.9) when R0 was 1.5, by 93.0% (81.5-99.7) when R0 was 2.0, and by 78.2% (59.0 -94.4) when R0 was 2.5. Assuming increasing asymptomatic\nfractions up to 50.0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R0 of 1.5.\nINTERPRETATION: Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of\nSARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because\nat this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the\nneed for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

Although relevant for many mental disorders,\nwe use the clinical disease category schizophrenia here as an example to discuss factors that oppose the naturalisation of clinical disease categories. We defend the provocative position that a complete\nsubstitution of the clinical diagnosis by a blood test is generally not desired among clinicians because various factors perpetuate the current diagnostic culture. These are (1) methodological problems, such as\na falsely presumed homogeneity of biological causes under the umbrella of one clinical diagnosis that prevents efficient subset identification, (2) professional fears, such as loss of importance of interview-diagnostic expert\nskills, and (3) conceptual problems, such as a dualistic mindset.

scan has insufficient sensitivity when staging men with high-risk localised prostate cancer. We aimed to investigate whether novel imaging using prostate-specific membrane antigen\n(PSMA) PET-CT might improve accuracy and affect management. METHODS: In this multicentre, two-arm, randomised study, we recruited men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and high-risk features at ten hospitals in Australia.\nPatients were randomly assigned to conventional imaging with CT and bone scanning or gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET-CT. First-line imaging was done within 21 days following randomisation. Patients crossed over unless three\nor more distant metastases were identified. The primary outcome was accuracy of first-line imaging for identifying either pelvic nodal or distant-metastatic disease defined by the receiver-operating curve using a predefined\nreference-standard including histopathology, imaging, and biochemistry at 6-month follow-up. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ANZCTR12617000005358. FINDINGS: From March 22, 2017 to Nov 02,\n2018, 339 men were assessed for eligibility and 302 men were randomly assigned. 152 (50%) men were randomly assigned to conventional imaging and 150 (50%) to PSMA PET-CT. Of 295\n(98%) men with follow-up, 87 (30%) had pelvic nodal or distant metastatic disease. PSMA PET-CT had a 27% (95% CI 23-31) greater accuracy than that of conventional imaging (92% [88-95]\nvs 65% [60-69]; p<0.0001). We found a lower sensitivity (38% [24-52] vs 85% [74-96]) and specificity (91% [85-97] vs 98% [95-100]) for conventional imaging compared with PSMA PET-CT. Subgroup analyses\nalso showed the superiority of PSMA PET-CT (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve 91% vs 59% [32% absolute difference; 28-35] for patients with pelvic nodal metastases,\nand 95% vs 74% [22% absolute difference; 18-26] for patients with distant metastases). First-line conventional imaging conferred management change less frequently (23 [15%] men [10-22] vs 41 [28%] men [21-36];\np=0.008) and had more equivocal findings (23% [17-31] vs 7% [4-13]) than PSMA PET-CT did. Radiation exposure was 10.9 mSv (95% CI 9.8-12.0) higher for conventional imaging than for PSMA\nPET-CT (19.2 mSv vs 8.4 mSv; p<0.001). We found high reporter agreement for PSMA PET-CT (kappa=0.87 for nodal and kappa=0.88 for distant metastases). In patients who underwent second-line image, management\nchange occurred in seven (5%) of 136 patients following conventional imaging, and in 39 (27%) of 146 following PSMA PET-CT. INTERPRETATION: PSMA PET-CT is a suitable replacement for conventional imaging,\nproviding superior accuracy, to the combined findings of CT and bone scanning.

Contemporary information about the types of infections, causative pathogens, and outcomes can aid the development of policies for\nprevention, diagnosis, treatment, and resource allocation and may assist in the design of interventional studies. Objective: To provide information about the prevalence and outcomes of infection and the available resources\nin ICUs worldwide. Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational 24-hour point prevalence study with longitudinal follow-up at 1150 centers in 88 countries. All adult patients (aged >/=18 years) treated at a\nparticipating ICU during a 24-hour period commencing at 08:00 on September 13, 2017, were included. The final follow-up date was November 13, 2017. Exposures: Infection diagnosis and receipt of antibiotics.\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of infection and antibiotic exposure (cross-sectional design) and all-cause in-hospital mortality (longitudinal design). Results: Among 15202 included patients (mean age, 61.1 years [SD, 17.3 years];\n9181 were men [60.4%]), infection data were available for 15165 (99.8%); 8135 (54%) had suspected or proven infection, including 1760 (22%) with ICU-acquired infection. A total of 10640 patients (70%)\nreceived at least 1 antibiotic. The proportion of patients with suspected or proven infection ranged from 43% (141/328) in Australasia to 60% (1892/3150) in Asia and the Middle East. Among\nthe 8135 patients with suspected or proven infection, 5259 (65%) had at least 1 positive microbiological culture; gram-negative microorganisms were identified in 67% of these patients (n = 3540), gram-positive\nmicroorganisms in 37% (n = 1946), and fungal microorganisms in 16% (n = 864). The in-hospital mortality rate was 30% (2404/7936) in patients with suspected or proven infection. In a\nmultilevel analysis, ICU-acquired infection was independently associated with higher risk of mortality compared with community-acquired infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.32 [95% CI, 1.10-1.60]; P = .003). Among antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, infection\nwith vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (OR, 2.41 [95% CI, 1.43-4.06]; P = .001), Klebsiella resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems (OR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.02-1.63]; P = .03), or\ncarbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.08-1.81]; P = .01) was independently associated with a higher risk of death vs infection with another microorganism.

Despite its\nimportance, NASH is underrecognized in clinical practice. Observations: NASH affects an estimated 3% to 6% of the US population and the prevalence is increasing. NASH is strongly associated with obesity,\ndyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Although a number of noninvasive tests and scoring systems exist to characterize NAFLD and NASH, liver biopsy is the only accepted method for\ndiagnosis of NASH. Currently, no NASH-specific therapies are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Lifestyle modification is the mainstay of treatment, including dietary changes and exercise, with the\nprimary goal being weight loss. Substantial improvement in histologic outcomes, including fibrosis, is directly correlated with increasing weight loss. In some cases, bariatric surgery may be indicated to achieve and\nmaintain the necessary degree of weight loss required for therapeutic effect. An estimated 20% of patients with NASH will develop cirrhosis, and NASH is predicted to become the leading indication\nfor liver transplants in the US. The mortality rate among patients with NASH is substantially higher than the general population or patients without this inflammatory subtype of NAFLD, with annual\nall-cause mortality rate of 25.56 per 1000 person-years and a liver-specific mortality rate of 11.77 per 1000 person-years. Conclusions and Relevance: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis affects 3% to 6% of the US\npopulation, is more prevalent in patients with metabolic disease and obesity, progresses to cirrhosis in approximately 20% of cases, and is associated with increased rates of liver-specific and overall mortality.\nEarly identification and targeted treatment of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are needed to improve patient outcomes, including directing patients toward intensive lifestyle modification to promote weight loss and referral for\nbariatric surgery as indicated for management of obesity and metabolic disease.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32207804", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32207802", "Title": "The Other Side.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/25 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 24", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32207802", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32207800", "Title": "Penicillin Allergy in Pregnancy.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/25 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 24", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32207800", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32207799", "Title": "Association of Daily Step Count and Step Intensity With Mortality Among US Adults.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/25 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 24", "Abstract": "Importance: It is unclear whether the number of steps per day and the intensity of stepping are associated with lower mortality. Objective: Describe the dose-response relationship between step count and\nintensity and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Representative sample of US adults aged at least 40 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who wore an accelerometer for\nup to 7 days ( from 2003-2006). Mortality was ascertained through December 2015. Exposures: Accelerometer-measured number of steps per day and 3 step intensity measures (extended bout cadence, peak 30-minute\ncadence, and peak 1-minute cadence [steps/min]). Accelerometer data were based on measurements obtained during a 7-day period at baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary\noutcomes were cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs), mortality rates, and 95% CIs were estimated using cubic splines and quartile classifications adjusting for age; sex; race/ethnicity; education;\ndiet; smoking status; body mass index; self-reported health; mobility limitations; and diagnoses of diabetes, stroke, heart disease, heart failure, cancer, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Results: A total of 4840 participants\n(mean age, 56.8 years; 2435 [54%] women; 1732 [36%] individuals with obesity) wore accelerometers for a mean of 5.7 days for a mean of 14.4 hours per day. The mean\nnumber of steps per day was 9124. There were 1165 deaths over a mean 10.1 years of follow-up, including 406 CVD and 283 cancer deaths. The unadjusted incidence density for\nall-cause mortality was 76.7 per 1000 person-years (419 deaths) for the 655 individuals who took less than 4000 steps per day; 21.4 per 1000 person-years (488 deaths) for the 1727\nindividuals who took 4000 to 7999 steps per day; 6.9 per 1000 person-years (176 deaths) for the 1539 individuals who took 8000 to 11999 steps per day; and 4.8 per\n1000 person-years (82 deaths) for the 919 individuals who took at least 12000 steps per day. Compared with taking 4000 steps per day, taking 8000 steps per day was associated\nwith significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.44-0.55]), as was taking 12000 steps per day (HR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.28-0.45]). Unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality by peak\n30 cadence was 32.9 per 1000 person-years (406 deaths) for the 1080 individuals who took 18.5 to 56.0 steps per minute; 12.6 per 1000 person-years (207 deaths) for the 1153\nindividuals who took 56.1 to 69.2 steps per minute; 6.8 per 1000 person-years (124 deaths) for the 1074 individuals who took 69.3 to 82.8 steps per minute; and 5.3 per\n1000 person-years (108 deaths) for the 1037 individuals who took 82.9 to 149.5 steps per minute.

Objective: To characterize trends in diet quality\namong US youth. Design, Setting, and Participants: Serial cross-sectional investigation using 24-hour dietary recalls from youth aged 2 to 19 years from 9 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\ncycles (1999-2016). Exposures: Calendar year and population sociodemographic characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were the survey-weighted, energy-adjusted mean consumption of dietary components and proportion meeting targets of\nthe American Heart Association (AHA) 2020 continuous diet score (range, 0-50; based on total fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish and shellfish, sugar-sweetened beverages, and sodium). Additional outcomes were the\nAHA secondary score (range, 0-80; adding nuts, seeds, and legumes; processed meat; and saturated fat) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2015 score (range, 0-100). Poor diet was defined as less\nthan 40% adherence (scores, <20 for primary and <32 for secondary AHA scores); intermediate as 40% to 79.9% adherence (scores, 20-39.9 and 32-63.9, respectively); and ideal, as at least 80%\nadherence (scores, >/=40 and >/=64, respectively). Higher diet scores indicate better diet quality; a minimal clinically important difference has not been quantified.

Objective: To determine the diagnostic yield of newborn screening for biliary atresia with direct or conjugated bilirubin measurements and to evaluate the association of screening implementation with clinical\noutcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional screening study of 124385 infants born at 14 Texas hospitals between January 2015 and June 2018; and a pre-post study of 43 infants\nwho underwent the Kasai portoenterostomy as treatment for biliary atresia at the region's largest pediatric hepatology center before (January 2008-June 2011) or after (January 2015-June 2018) screening implementation. Final follow-up\noccurred on July 15, 2019. Exposures: Two-stage screening with direct or conjugated bilirubin measurements. In stage 1, all newborns were tested within the first 60 hours of life, with a\npositive screening result defined as bilirubin levels exceeding derived 95th percentile reference intervals. In stage 2, infants who had a positive screening result in stage 1 were retested at or\nbefore the 2-week well-child visit, with a positive screening result defined as bilirubin levels greater than the stage 1 result or greater than 1 mg/dL. Main Outcomes and Measures: The\nprimary outcomes of the screening study were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value based on infants testing positive in both stages. The reference standard was biliary atresia\ndiagnosed at the region's pediatric hepatology centers. The primary outcome of the pre-post study was the age infants underwent the Kasai portoenterostomy for treatment of biliary atresia. Results: Of 124385\nnewborns in the screening study, 49.2% were female, 87.6% were of term gestational age, 70.0% were white, and 48.1% were Hispanic. Screening identified the 7 known infants with biliary atresia\nwith a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 56.1%-100.0%), a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI, 99.9%-99.9%), a positive predictive value of 5.9% (95% CI, 2.6%-12.2%), and a negative predictive value of\n100.0% (95% CI, 100.0%-100.0%). In the pre-post study, 24 infants were treated before screening implementation and 19 infants were treated after screening implementation (including 6 of 7 from the screening\nstudy, 7 from screening at nonstudy hospitals, and 6 from referrals because of clinical symptoms). The age infants underwent the Kasai portoenterostomy was significantly younger after screening was implemented (mean\nage, 56 days [SD, 19 days] before screening implementation vs 36 days [SD, 22 days] after screening implementation; between-group difference, 19 days [95% CI, 7-32 days]; P = .004). Conclusions\nand Relevance: Newborn screening with direct or conjugated bilirubin measurements detected all known infants with biliary atresia in the study population, although the 95% CI around the sensitivity estimate was\nwide and the study design did not ensure complete ascertainment of false-negative results.

Review.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/25 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Feb 5", "Abstract": "Importance: Recognizing patients in whom endotracheal intubation is likely to be difficult can help alert physicians to the need for assistance from a clinician with airway training and having advanced\nairway management equipment available. Objective: To identify risk factors and physical findings that predict difficult intubation. Data Sources: The databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1946 to June\n2018 and from 1947 to June 2018, respectively, and the reference lists from the retrieved articles and previous reviews were searched for additional studies. Study Selection: Sixty-two studies with high\n(level 1-3) methodological quality that evaluated the accuracy of clinical findings for identifying difficult intubation were reviewed. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two authors independently abstracted data. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were\nused to calculate summary positive likelihood ratios across studies or univariate random-effects models when bivariate models failed to converge. Results: Among the 62 high-quality studies involving 33559 patients, 10% (95%\nCI, 8.2%-12%) of patients were difficult to intubate. The physical examination findings that best predicted a difficult intubation included a grade of class 3 on the upper lip bite test\n(lower incisors cannot extend to reach the upper lip; positive likelihood ratio, 14 [95% CI, 8.9-22]; specificity, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.97]), shorter hyomental distance (range of <3-5.5 cm; positive likelihood\nratio, 6.4 [95% CI, 4.1-10]; specificity, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94-0.98]), retrognathia (mandible measuring <9 cm from the angle of the jaw to the tip of the chin or subjectively short;\npositive likelihood ratio, 6.0 [95% CI, 3.1-11]; specificity, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.90-1.0]), and a combination of physical findings based on the Wilson score (positive likelihood ratio, 9.1 [95% CI, 5.1-16];\nspecificity, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.90-0.98]). The widely used modified Mallampati score (>/=3) had a positive likelihood ratio of 4.1 (95% CI, 3.0-5.6; specificity, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.81-0.91]). Conclusions and Relevance:\nAlthough several simple clinical findings are useful for predicting a higher likelihood of difficult endotracheal intubation, no clinical finding reliably excludes a difficult intubation. An abnormal upper lip bite test,\nwhich is easily assessed by clinicians, raises the probability of difficult intubation from 10% to greater than 60% for the average-risk patient.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32207774", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32207769", "Title": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Influenza 2019-2020.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/25 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 24", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32207769", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32207768", "Title": "Comparison of Abbreviated Breast MRI vs Digital Breast Tomosynthesis for Breast Cancer Detection Among Women With Dense Breasts Undergoing Screening.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/25 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 25", "Abstract": "Importance: Improved screening methods for women with dense breasts are needed because of their increased risk of breast cancer and of failed early diagnosis by screening mammography. Objective: To compare\nthe screening performance of abbreviated breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in women with dense breasts. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study with longitudinal follow-up at\n48 academic, community hospital, and private practice sites in the United States and Germany, conducted between December 2016 and November 2017 among average-risk women aged 40 to 75 years with\nheterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts undergoing routine screening. Follow-up ascertainment of cancer diagnoses was complete through September 12, 2019. Exposures: All women underwent screening by both DBT and abbreviated\nbreast MRI, performed in randomized order and read independently to avoid interpretation bias. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the invasive cancer detection rate. Secondary outcomes included\nsensitivity, specificity, additional imaging recommendation rate, and positive predictive value (PPV) of biopsy, using invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to define a positive reference standard. All outcomes\nare reported at the participant level. Pathology of core or surgical biopsy was the reference standard for cancer detection rate and PPV; interval cancers reported until the next annual screen\nwere included in the reference standard for sensitivity and specificity. Results: Among 1516 enrolled women, 1444 (median age, 54 [range, 40-75] years) completed both examinations and were included in the\nanalysis. The reference standard was positive for invasive cancer with or without DCIS in 17 women and for DCIS alone in another 6. No interval cancers were observed during follow-up.\nAbbreviated breast MRI detected all 17 women with invasive cancer and 5 of 6 women with DCIS. Digital breast tomosynthesis detected 7 of 17 women with invasive cancer and 2\nof 6 women with DCIS. The invasive cancer detection rate was 11.8 (95% CI, 7.4-18.8) per 1000 women for abbreviated breast MRI vs 4.8 (95% CI, 2.4-10.0) per 1000 women\nfor DBT, a difference of 7 (95% CI, 2.2-11.6) per 1000 women (exact McNemar P = .002). For detection of invasive cancer and DCIS, sensitivity was 95.7% (95% CI, 79.0%-99.2%)\nwith abbreviated breast MRI vs 39.1% (95% CI, 22.2%-59.2%) with DBT (P = .001) and specificity was 86.7% (95% CI, 84.8%-88.4%) vs 97.4% (95% CI, 96.5%-98.1%), respectively (P < .001).\nThe additional imaging recommendation rate was 7.5% (95% CI, 6.2%-9.0%) with abbreviated breast MRI vs 10.1% (95% CI, 8.7%-11.8%) with DBT (P = .02) and the PPV was 19.6% (95%\nCI, 13.2%-28.2%) vs 31.0% (95% CI, 17.0%-49.7%), respectively (P = .15). Conclusions and Relevance: Among women with dense breasts undergoing screening, abbreviated breast MRI, compared with DBT, was associated with\na significantly higher rate of invasive breast cancer detection. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between screening methods and clinical outcome.

However, no large-scale trial has examined the efficacy\nof this therapy for improving semen quality or live birth. Objective: To determine the effect of daily folic acid and zinc supplementation on semen quality and live birth. Design, Setting,\nand Participants: The Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation Trial was a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Couples (n = 2370; men aged >/=18 years and women aged 18-45 years) planning infertility\ntreatment were enrolled at 4 US reproductive endocrinology and infertility care study centers between June 2013 and December 2017. The last 6-month study visit for semen collection occurred during August\n2018, with chart abstraction of live birth and pregnancy information completed during April 2019. Interventions: Men were block randomized by study center and planned infertility treatment (in vitro fertilization, other\ntreatment at a study site, and other treatment at an outside clinic) to receive either 5 mg of folic acid and 30 mg of elemental zinc (n = 1185) or\nplacebo (n = 1185) daily for 6 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The co-primary outcomes were live birth (resulting from pregnancies occurring within 9 months of randomization) and semen quality\nparameters (sperm concentration, motility, morphology, volume, DNA fragmentation, and total motile sperm count) at 6 months after randomization. Results: Among 2370 men who were randomized (mean age, 33 years), 1773\n(75%) attended the final 6-month study visit. Live birth outcomes were available for all couples, and 1629 men (69%) had semen available for analysis at 6 months after randomization. Live\nbirth was not significantly different between treatment groups (404 [34%] in the folic acid and zinc group and 416 [35%] in the placebo group; risk difference, -0.9% [95% CI, -4.7%\nto 2.8%]). Most of the semen quality parameters (sperm concentration, motility, morphology, volume, and total motile sperm count) were not significantly different between treatment groups at 6 months after randomization.\nA statistically significant increase in DNA fragmentation was observed with folic acid and zinc supplementation (mean of 29.7% for percentage of DNA fragmentation in the folic acid and zinc group\nand 27.2% in the placebo group; mean difference, 2.4% [95% CI, 0.5% to 4.4%]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common with folic acid and zinc supplementation compared with placebo (abdominal discomfort\nor pain: 66 [6%] vs 40 [3%], respectively; nausea: 50 [4%] vs 24 [2%]; and vomiting: 32 [3%] vs 17 [1%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among a general population of couples\nseeking infertility treatment, the use of folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve semen quality or couples' live birth rates. These findings\ndo not support the use of folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners in the treatment of infertility.

In turn, wheeze has been associated with bacterial dysbiosis of the respiratory tract. We investigated the\neffects of RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab in otherwise healthy preterm infants on respiratory microbiota composition at 1 year and 6 years of age. METHODS: In a multicentre, single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled\ntrial (the MAKI trial), infants born between 32-35 weeks of gestation, in one university and in 15 regional hospitals in the the Netherlands, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive palivizumab\nor placebo during the RSV season of their first year of life. Intramuscular injections of palivizumab 15 mg/kg or placebo were given during one RSV season: either from Oct 1,\nor from discharge from the neonatal unit until March 10 (minimun of 2 and maximum of 5 injections were given). Children were 6 months old or younger at the start\nof the RSV season; exclusion criteria included congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, Down's syndrome, or other serious congenital disorders, use of mechanical ventilation at birth, treatment with surfactant, or physician-diagnosed\nwheeze before the start of the RSV season. Children were followed up for clinical symptoms until 6 years of age. For this subanalysis, we obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from children aged\n1 year and 6 years and analysed them using 16S-rRNA sequencing. At 6 years we also measured reversible airway obstruction. The primary outcome was the effect of palivizumab during infancy\non the respiratory microbiota composition at age 1 year and 6 years (intention-to-treat analysis). The trial is registered in the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN73641710. FINDINGS: From April 1, 2008, to\nDec 31, 2010, 429 infants were enrolled in the MAKI trial (n=214 to the palivizumab group; n=215 to the placebo group). At 1 year, we collected swabs and sequenced DNA\nfrom 170 (40%) of 429 children, of which 145 (85%) samples had high-quality DNA. The overall microbiota composition was significantly different (R(2) 1.3%; p=0.0185) between the palivizumab group and the\nplacebo group at 1 year of life; children in the palivizumab group had a significantly lower abundance of the Staphylococcus-dominated cluster (odds ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.11-0.68]; p=0.00394), an increased\nabundance of biomarker species, such as Klebsiella, and a more diverse set of oral taxa, including Streptococcus spp, compared with children in the placebo group. At 6 years, we collected\nswabs and sequenced DNA from 349 (88%) of 395 children who completed follow-up, of which 342 (98%) samples had high-quality DNA. The overall microbiota composition was not significantly different between\ngroups at 6 years (R(2) 0.6%; p=0.0575); however, children in the palivizumab group had a significantly increased abundance of Haemophilus spp and lower abundance of Moraxella and Neisseriaceae spp compared\nwith children in the placebo group. Absence of PCR-confirmed RSV infection at 1 year was significantly associated with a higher abundance of Haemophilus spp at age 6 years and a\nsignificantly lower abundance of Moraxella and Neisseriaceae than children with RSV infection at 1 year. Reversible airway obstruction at 6 years was also positively associated with Haemophilus abundance and negatively\nassociated with the abundance of health-associated taxa, such as Moraxella, Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, and Staphylococcus, even after correction for RSV immunoprophylaxis (all: p<0.05). Additionally, reversible airway instruction was associated with significantly\nhigher Streptococcus pneumoniae abundance. INTERPRETATION: Palivizumab in infancy in otherwise healthy preterm infants is associated with persistent effects on the abundance of specific, potentially pathogenic, microbial taxa in the respiratory\ntract. Several of the palivizumab-associated biomarker species were associated with reversible airway obstruction at age 6 years. These results warrant further studies to establish the long-term ecological effects and health\nconsequences of palivizumab in infancy.

Pemigatinib is a selective, potent, oral inhibitor of FGFR1, 2, and 3. This study\nevaluated the safety and antitumour activity of pemigatinib in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with and without FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label,\nsingle-arm, multicohort, phase 2 study (FIGHT-202), patients aged 18 years or older with disease progression following at least one previous treatment and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status\nof 0-2 recruited from 146 academic or community-based sites in the USA, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia were assigned to one of three cohorts: patients with FGFR2 fusions or\nrearrangements, patients with other FGF/FGFR alterations, or patients with no FGF/FGFR alterations. All enrolled patients received a starting dose of 13.5 mg oral pemigatinib once daily (21-day cycle; 2 weeks\non, 1 week off) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or physician decision. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response among those\nwith FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, assessed centrally in all patients who received at least one dose of pemigatinib. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02924376, and enrolment is completed. FINDINGS:\nBetween Jan 17, 2017, and March 22, 2019, 146 patients were enrolled: 107 with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, 20 with other FGF/FGFR alterations, 18 with no FGF/FGFR alterations, and one\nwith an undetermined FGF/FGFR alteration. The median follow-up was 17.8 months (IQR 11.6-21.3). 38 (35.5% [95% CI 26.5-45.4]) patients with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements achieved an objective response (three complete\nresponses and 35 partial responses). Overall, hyperphosphataemia was the most common all-grade adverse event irrespective of cause (88 [60%] of 146 patients). 93 (64%) patients had a grade 3 or\nworse adverse event (irrespective of cause); the most frequent were hypophosphataemia (18 [12%]), arthralgia (nine [6%]), stomatitis (eight [5%]), hyponatraemia (eight [5%]), abdominal pain (seven [5%]), and fatigue (seven [5%]).\n65 (45%) patients had serious adverse events; the most frequent were abdominal pain (seven [5%]), pyrexia (seven [5%]), cholangitis (five [3%]), and pleural effusion (five [3%]). Overall, 71 (49%) patients\ndied during the study, most frequently because of disease progression (61 [42%]); no deaths were deemed to be treatment related. INTERPRETATION: These data support the therapeutic potential of pemigatinib in\npreviously treated patients with cholangiocarcinoma who have FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements.

Oncology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/24 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 20", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: BIG 3-07/TROG 07.01 is an international, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial evaluating tumour bed boost and hypofractionation in patients with non-low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ following breast-conserving surgery\nand whole breast radiotherapy. Here, we report the effects of diagnosis and treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at 2 years. METHODS: The BIG 3-07/TROG 07.01 trial is ongoing\nat 118 hospitals in 11 countries. Women aged 18 years or older with completely excised non-low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned, by use of a minimisation algorithm, to\ntumour bed boost or no tumour bed boost, following conventional whole breast radiotherapy or hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy using one of three randomisation categories. Category A was a 4-arm randomisation\nof tumour bed boost versus no boost following conventional whole breast radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) versus hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy (42.5 Gy in 16 fractions\nover 3.5 weeks). Category B was a 2-arm randomisation between tumour bed boost versus no boost following conventional whole breast radiotherapy, and category C was a 2-arm randomisation between tumour\nbed boost versus no boost following hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy. Stratification factors were age at diagnosis, planned endocrine therapy, and treating centre. The primary endpoint, time to local recurrence, will\nbe reported when participants have completed 5 years of follow-up. The HRQOL statistical analysis plan prespecified eight aspects of HRQOL, assessed by four questionnaires at baseline, end of treatment, and\nat 6, 12, and 24 months after radiotherapy: fatigue and physical functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30); cosmetic status, breast-specific symptoms, arm and shoulder functional status (Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale); body image\nand sexuality (Body Image Scale); and perceived risk of invasive breast cancer (Cancer Worry Scale and a study-specific question). For each of these measures, tumour bed boost was compared with\nno boost, and conventional whole breast radiotherapy compared with hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy, by use of generalised estimating equation models. Analyses were by intention to treat, with Hochberg adjustment for\nmultiple testing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00470236. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2007, and Aug 14, 2013, 1208 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive no tumour bed\nboost (n=605) or tumour bed boost (n=603). 396 of 1208 women were assigned to category A: conventional whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=100) or no boost (n=98), or\nto hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=98) or no boost (n=100). 447 were assigned to category B: conventional whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=223) or\nno boost (n=224). 365 were assigned to category C: hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy with tumour bed boost (n=182) or no boost (n=183). All patients were followed up at 2 years\nfor the HRQOL analysis. 1098 (91%) of 1208 patients received their allocated treatment, and most completed their scheduled HRQOL assessments (1147 [95%] of 1208 at baseline; 988 [87%] of 1141\nat 2 years). Cosmetic status was worse with tumour bed boost than with no boost across all timepoints (difference 0.10 [95% CI 0.05-0.15], global p=0.00014, Hochberg-adjusted p=0.0016); at the end\nof treatment, the estimated difference between tumour bed boost and no boost was 0.13 (95% CI 0.06-0.20; p=0.00021), persisting at 24 months (0.13 [0.06-0.20]; p=0.00021). Arm and shoulder function was\nalso adversely affected by tumour bed boost across all timepoints (0.08 [95% CI 0.03-0.13], global p=0.0033, Hochberg adjusted p=0.045); the difference between tumour bed boost and no boost at the\nend of treatment was 0.08 (0.01 to 0.15, p=0.021), and did not persist at 24 months (0.04 [-0.03 to 0.11], p=0.29). None of the other six prespecified aspects of HRQOL\ndiffered significantly after adjustment for multiple testing. Conventional whole breast radiotherapy was associated with worse body image than hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy at the end of treatment (difference -1.10 [95%\nCI -1.79 to -0.42], p=0.0016). No significant differences were reported in the other PROs between conventional whole breast radiotherapy compared with hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy. INTERPRETATION: Tumour bed boost was\nassociated with persistent adverse effects on cosmetic status and arm and shoulder functional status, which might inform shared decision making while local recurrence analysis is pending.

METHODS: In this multicentre, double-blind, response-adaptive, randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients from 58 hospital emergency departments across the\nUSA. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 2 years or older, had been treated for a generalised convulsive seizure of longer than 5 min duration with adequate\ndoses of benzodiazepines, and continued to have persistent or recurrent convulsions in the emergency department for at least 5 min and no more than 30 min after the last dose\nof benzodiazepine. Patients were randomly assigned in a response-adaptive manner, using Bayesian methods and stratified by age group (<18 years, 18-65 years, and >65 years), to levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, or valproate.\nAll patients, investigators, study staff, and pharmacists were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was absence of clinically apparent seizures with improved consciousness and without additional antiseizure medication at\n1 h from start of drug infusion. The primary safety outcome was life-threatening hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia. The efficacy and safety outcomes were analysed by intention to treat. This study\nis registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01960075. FINDINGS: Between Nov 3, 2015, and Dec 29, 2018, we enrolled 478 patients and 462 unique patients were included: 225 children (aged <18 years), 186\nadults (18-65 years), and 51 older adults (>65 years). 175 (38%) patients were randomly assigned to levetiracetam, 142 (31%) to fosphenyltoin, and 145 (31%) were to valproate. Baseline characteristics were\nbalanced across treatments within age groups. The primary efficacy outcome was met in those treated with levetiracetam for 52% (95% credible interval 41-62) of children, 44% (33-55) of adults, and\n37% (19-59) of older adults; with fosphenytoin in 49% (38-61) of children, 46% (34-59) of adults, and 35% (17-59) of older adults; and with valproate in 52% (41-63) of children,\n46% (34-58) of adults, and 47% (25-70) of older adults. No differences were detected in efficacy or primary safety outcome by drug within each age group. With the exception of\nendotracheal intubation in children, secondary safety outcomes did not significantly differ by drug within each age group. INTERPRETATION: Children, adults, and older adults with established status epilepticus respond similarly to\nlevetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate, with treatment success in approximately half of patients. Any of the three drugs can be considered as a potential first-choice, second-line drug for benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus.\nFUNDING: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32203691", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32203690", "Title": "Second-line anticonvulsants for paediatric convulsive status epilepticus.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/24 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 20", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32203690", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32203681", "Title": "Insulin access and affordability in the USA: anticipating the first interchangeable insulin product.", "JournalName": "The lancet.

Psychiatry", "Creation Date": "2020/03/23 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Better understanding of the heterogeneity of treatment responses could help to improve care for adolescents with depression. We analysed data from a clinical trial to assess whether specific symptom\nclusters responded differently to various treatments. METHODS: For this secondary analysis, we used data from the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS), in which 439 US adolescents aged 12-17\nwith a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder and a minimum score of 45 on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to treatment with fluoxetine, cognitive\nbehavioural therapy (CBT), fluoxetine plus CBT, or pill placebo. Our analysis focuses on the acute phase of the trial (ie, the first 12 weeks). Groups of co-occurring symptoms were established\nby clustering scores for each CDRS-R item at baseline with Ward's method, with Euclidean distances for hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We then used a linear mixed-effects model to investigate the relationship\nbetween symptom clusters and treatment efficacy, with the sum of symptom scores within each cluster as the dependent measure. As fixed effects, we entered cluster, time, and treatment assignment, with\nall two-way and three-way interactions, into the model. The random effect providing better fit was established to be a by-subject random slope for cluster based on improvement in the Schwarz-Bayesian\ninformation criterion. OUTCOMES: We identified two symptom clusters: cluster 1 comprised depressed mood, difficulty having fun, irritability, social withdrawal, sleep disturbance, impaired schoolwork, excessive fatigue, and low self-esteem, and cluster\n2 comprised increased appetite, physical complaints, excessive weeping, decreased appetite, excessive guilt, morbid ideation, and suicidal ideation. For cluster 1 symptoms, CDRS-R scores were reduced by 5.8 points (95% CI\n2.8-8.9) in adolescents treated with fluoxetine plus CBT, and by 4.1 points (1.1-7.1) in those treated with fluoxetine, compared with those given placebo. For cluster 2 symptoms, no significant differences\nin improvements in CDRS-R scores were detected between the active treatment and placebo groups. INTERPRETATION: Response to fluoxetine and CBT among adolescents with depression is heterogeneous. Clinicians should consider clinical\nprofile when selecting therapeutic modality. The contrast in response patterns between symptom clusters could provide opportunities to improve treatment efficacy by gearing the development of new therapies towards the resolution\nof specific symptoms.

The study was observer-blind from study start until interim day 30 analysis and became single-blind as of interim analysis.\nPrimary outcomes assessed were serious adverse events (up to study end, month 12), solicited local or general adverse events (7 days post-vaccination), unsolicited adverse events (30 days post-vaccination), haematological or\nbiochemical abnormalities, and clinical symptoms of thrombocytopenia (day 0-6). As secondary endpoints, we evaluated anti-glycoprotein Zaire Ebola virus antibody titres (ELISA) pre-vaccination and 30 days post-vaccination. This study is registered\nwith ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02548078. FINDINGS: From Nov 11, 2015, to May 9, 2016, of 776 children screened for eligibility, 600 were randomly assigned (200 [33%] in each age strata: 1-5, 6-12,\n13-17 years), 300 (50%) to the ChAd3-EBO-Z/MenACWY-TT group and 300 (50%) to the MenACWY-TT/ChAd3-EBO-Z group; all were included in the total vaccinated cohort. Post-day 0 vaccination, the most common solicited\ninjection site symptom was pain (127 [42%] of 300 in the ChAd3-EBO-Z/MenACWY-TT group vs 60 [20%] of 300 in the MenACWY-TT/ChAd3-EBO-Z group); the most common solicited general adverse event was\nfever (95 [32%] of 300 in the ChAd3-EBO-Z/MenACWY-TT group vs 28 [9%] of 300 in the MenACWY-TT/ChAd3-EBO-Z group). Unsolicited adverse events post-day 0 vaccination were reported by 41 (14%) of\n300 participants in the ChAd3-EBO-Z/MenACWY-TT group and 24 (8%) of 300 MenACWY-TT/ChAd3-EBO-Z recipients. Serious adverse events were reported for two (1%) of 300 children in each group; none were considered\nvaccination related. No clinical symptoms of thrombocytopenia were reported. At day 30, anti-glycoprotein Ebola virus antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMC) in the ChAd3-EBO-Z/MenACWY-TT group were 1564 (95% CI 1340-1826) for\nthose aged 13-17 years, 1395 (1175-1655) for 6-12 years, and 2406 (1942-2979) for 1-5 years. Anti-glycoprotein Ebola virus IgG antibody responses persisted up to 12 months post-vaccination, with a GMC\nof 716 (95% CI 619-828) for those aged 13-17 years, 752 (645-876) for 6-12 years, and 1424 (1119-1814) for 1-5 years. INTERPRETATION: ChAd3-EBO-Z was immunogenic and well tolerated in children\naged 1-17 years. This study provides the first ChAd3-EBO-Z data in a paediatric population. Further development should focus on multivalent approaches including Sudan and Marburg strains, and heterologous prime-boost strategies,\nfor instance using modified vaccinia Ankara-based vaccine to boost the immune response.

Often, post-marketing research landscape is fragmented. When regulatory agencies\nrequire pharmaceutical and device manufacturers to conduct studies in the post-marketing period, these studies might remain incomplete many years after approval. Even when completed, many post-marketing studies lack meaningful active\ncomparators, have observational designs, and might not collect patient-relevant outcomes. Regulators, in collaboration with the industry and patients, ought to ensure that the key questions unanswered at the time of\ndrug and device approval are resolved in a timely fashion during the post-marketing phase. We propose a set of seven key guiding principles that we believe will provide the necessary\nincentives for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers to generate comparative data in the post-marketing period. First, regulators (for drugs and devices), notified bodies (for devices in Europe), health technology assessment organisations,\nand payers should develop customised evidence generation plans, ensuring that future post-approval studies address any limitations of the data available at the time of market entry impacting the benefit-risk profiles\nof drugs and devices. Second, post-marketing studies should be designed hierarchically: priority should be given to efforts aimed at evaluating a product's net clinical benefit in randomised trials compared with\ncurrent known effective therapy, whenever possible, to address common decisional dilemmas. Third, post-marketing studies should incorporate active comparators as appropriate. Fourth, use of non-randomised studies for the evaluation of clinical\nbenefit in the post-marketing period should be limited to instances when the magnitude of effect is deemed to be large or when it is possible to reasonably infer the comparative\nbenefits or risks in settings, in which doing a randomised trial is not feasible. Fifth, efficiency of randomised trials should be improved by streamlining patient recruitment and data collection through\ninnovative design elements. Sixth, governments should directly support and facilitate the production of comparative post-marketing data by investing in the development of collaborative research networks and data systems that reduce\nthe complexity, cost, and waste of rigorous post-marketing research efforts. Last, financial incentives and penalties should be developed or more actively reinforced.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32199487", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32199486", "Title": "Generating comparative evidence on new drugs and devices before approval.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/23 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 21", "Abstract": "Fewer than half of new drugs have data on their comparative benefits and harms against existing treatment options at the time of regulatory approval in Europe and the USA. Even\nwhen active-comparator trials exist, they might not produce meaningful data to inform decisions in clinical practice and health policy. The uncertainty associated with the paucity of well designed active-comparator trials\nhas been compounded by legal and regulatory changes in Europe and the USA that have created a complex mix of expedited programmes aimed at facilitating faster access to new drugs.\nComparative evidence generation is even sparser for medical devices. Some have argued that the current process for regulatory approval needs to generate more evidence that is useful for patients, clinicians,\nand payers in health-care systems. We propose a set of five key principles relevant to the European Medicines Agency, European medical device regulatory agencies, US Food and Drug Administration, as\nwell as payers, that we believe will provide the necessary incentives for pharmaceutical and device companies to generate comparative data on drugs and devices and assure timely availability of evidence\nthat is useful for decision making. First, labelling should routinely inform patients and clinicians whether comparative data exist on new products. Second, regulators should be more selective in their use\nof programmes that facilitate drug and device approvals on the basis of incomplete benefit and harm data. Third, regulators should encourage the conduct of randomised trials with active comparators. Fourth,\nregulators should use prospectively designed network meta-analyses based on existing and future randomised trials.

The\neffectiveness of contact investigations and preventive therapy remains poorly understood. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the development of tuberculosis in children closely exposed to a tuberculosis\ncase and followed for incident disease. We restricted our search to cohort studies published between Jan 1, 1998, and April 6, 2018, in MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and Embase\nelectronic databases. Individual-participant data and a pre-specified list of variables were requested from authors of all eligible studies. These included characteristics of the exposed child, the index case, and environmental\ncharacteristics. To be eligible for inclusion in the final analysis, a dataset needed to include: (1) individuals below 19 years of age; (2) follow-up for tuberculosis for a minimum of\n6 months; (3) individuals with household or close exposure to an individual with tuberculosis; (4) information on the age and sex of the child; and (5) start and end follow-up\ndates. Studies assessing incident tuberculosis but without dates or time of follow-up were excluded. Our analysis had two primary aims: (1) estimating the risk of developing tuberculosis by time-period of\nfollow-up, demographics (age, region), and clinical attributes (HIV, tuberculosis infection status, previous tuberculosis); and (2) estimating the effectiveness of preventive therapy and BCG vaccination on the risk of developing tuberculosis.\nWe estimated the odds of prevalent tuberculosis with mixed-effects logistic models and estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident tuberculosis with mixed-effects Poisson regression models. The effectiveness of preventive therapy\nagainst incident tuberculosis was estimated through propensity score matching. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018087022). FINDINGS: In total, study groups from 46 cohort studies in 34 countries-29 (63%)\nprospective studies and 17 (37%) retrospective-agreed to share their data and were included in the final analysis. 137 647 tuberculosis-exposed children were evaluated at baseline and 130 512 children were\nfollowed for 429 538 person-years, during which 1299 prevalent and 999 incident tuberculosis cases were diagnosed. Children not receiving preventive therapy with a positive result for tuberculosis infection had significantly\nhigher 2-year cumulative tuberculosis incidence than children with a negative result for tuberculosis infection, and this incidence was greatest among children below 5 years of age (19.0% [95% CI 8.4-37.4]).\nThe effectiveness of preventive therapy was 63% (adjusted HR 0.37 [95% CI 0.30-0.47]) among all exposed children, and 91% (adjusted HR 0.09 [0.05-0.15]) among those with a positive result for\ntuberculosis infection. Among all children <5 years of age who developed tuberculosis, 83% were diagnosed within 90 days of the baseline visit. INTERPRETATION: The risk of developing tuberculosis among exposed\ninfants and young children is very high. Most cases occurred within weeks of contact investigation initiation and might not be preventable through prophylaxis. This suggests that alternative strategies for prevention\nare needed, such as earlier initiation of preventive therapy through rapid diagnosis of adult cases or community-wide screening approaches.

Clinical trials with pembrolizumab have\nenrolled patients with performance status (PS) 0-1. However, around 18% of patients with NSCLC are PS2, and the activity and safety of pembrolizumab in these patients is unclear. We aimed\nto evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in these patients. METHODS: We did a multicentre, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial (PePS2) in ten hospitals in the UK, in which\npatients with NSCLC and a rigorous ascription of PS2 were given pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. No masking was used in this trial. We stratified the treatment evaluation by\ntumour proportion score (TPS) and line of therapy. Co-primary outcomes were: (1) durable clinical benefit (DCB), defined as the occurrence of complete response, partial response, or stable disease that continues\nuntil at least the second CT scan scheduled at 18 weeks; and (2) toxicity, defined as the occurrence at any time of treatment-related dose delay or treatment discontinuation due to\nan adverse event. Analysis included all patients who received any pembrolizumab. As well as reporting simple observed incidence for the co-primary outcomes, DCB and toxicity, we also estimated incidence using\na model-based method for correlated binary outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02733159; EudraCT, 2015-002241-55; and ISRCTN, 10047797. FINDINGS: Between Jan 4, 2017, and Feb 13, 2018, of 112\npatients assessed for eligibility, we recruited 62 patients. 60 patients were evaluable for the co-primary outcomes. Median age was 72 years (IQR 65-75); 33 (55%) of participants were male and\n27 (45%) were female. The observed incidence for DCB was 38% (95% CI 21-57) in first-line patients (n=24) and 36% (22-52) in subsequent-line patients (n=36); DCB was 22% (11-41) in\npatients with a TPS less than 1% (n=27), 47% (25-70) in patients with a TPS of 1-49% (n=15), and 53% (30-75) in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater\n(n=15). An increase in DCB incidences with TPS was also shown in model-based estimates. Toxicity was observed in 28% (95% CI 19-41) of patients, 11 (18%) of 60 due to\ndose delay and 6 (10%) of 60 due to drug discontinuation. No grade 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed and no early deaths were attributed to hyperprogression. The most common\ngrade 3-4 adverse events were dyspnoea (n=9), hyponatraemia (n=5), and anorexia (n=4). There were ten serious adverse events considered to be related to treatment, comprising diarrhoea (n=3) and acute kidney\ninjury, adrenal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinaemia, oral mucositis, rash, urinary tract infection, and vomiting (n=1 each). INTERPRETATION: Patients with NSCLC of PS2 are a group of patients of unmet therapeutic need. The\nPePS2 trial shows that pembrolizumab can be safely administered to these patients, with no increase in the risk of immune-related or other toxicities. Efficacy outcomes are at least as good\nas those in patients with PS0-1 and the data provides clinicians with the confidence to incorporate pembrolizumab into the treatment pathway of patients with NSCLC of PS2.

Given the scarcity of adequate data on the local geographical variation of these focal diseases, we aimed to investigate within-country incidence and geographical\nvariation of cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis at a high spatial resolution in Kyrgyzstan. METHODS: We mapped all confirmed surgical cases of cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis reported through the\nnational echinococcosis surveillance system in Kyrgyzstan between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2016, from nine regional databases. We then estimated crude surgical incidence, standardised incidence, and standardised incidence ratios\n(SIRs) of primary cases (ie, excluding relapses) based on age and sex at country, region, district, and local community levels. Finally, we tested the SIRs for global and local spatial\nautocorrelation to identify disease hotspots at the local community level. All incidence estimates were calculated per 100 000 population and averaged across the 3-year study period to obtain annual estimates.\nFINDINGS: The surveillance system reported 2359 primary surgical cases of cystic echinococcosis and 546 primary surgical cases of alveolar echinococcosis. Country-level crude surgical incidence was 13.1 per 100 000 population\nper year for cystic echinococcosis and 3.02 per 100 000 population per year for alveolar echinococcosis. At the local community level, we found annual crude surgical incidences up to 176\nper 100 000 population in Sary-Kamysh (Jalal-Abad region) for cystic echinococcosis and 246 per 100 000 population in Uch-Dobo (Alay district, Osh region) for alveolar echinococcosis. Significant hotspots of cystic\nechinococcosis were found in four regions: Osh (five local communities in Uzgen district and four in Alay district), Naryn (three local communities in Jumgal district and one in Naryn district),\nTalas (three local communities in Talas district), and Chuy (one local community in Jayyl district). Significant alveolar echinococcosis hotspots were detected in the Osh region (11 communities in Alay district,\nincluding the local community of Sary Mogol, and one in Chong-Alay district) and in the Naryn region (five communities in Jumgal district and three in At-Bashy district), in the southwest\nand centre of the country. INTERPRETATION: Our analyses reveal remarkable within-country variation in the surgical incidence of cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis in Kyrgyzstan. These high-resolution maps identify precise locations\nwhere interventions and epidemiological research should be targeted to reduce the burden of human cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis.

However, little is known about trends in health-care use and health outcomes\nacross different socioeconomic groups in the past decade. METHODS: We used data from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), a nationwide prospective cohort study of adults aged 30-79 years in 2004-08,\nin ten regions (five urban, five rural) in China. Individuals who were alive in 2009 were included in the present study. Data for all admissions were obtained by linkage to\nelectronic hospital records from the health insurance system, and to region-specific disease and death registers. Generalised linear models were used to estimate trends in annual hospital admission rates, 28-day case\nfatality rates, and mean length of stay for stroke, ischaemic heart disease, and any cause in all relevant individuals. FINDINGS: 512 715 participants were recruited to the CKB between June\n25, 2004, and July 15, 2008, 505 995 of whom were still alive on Jan 1, 2009, and contributed to the present study. Among them, we recorded 794 824 hospital\nadmissions (74 313 for stroke, 69 446 for ischaemic heart disease) between 2009 and 2016. After adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and morbidity factors, hospitalisation rates increased annually by 3.6%\nfor stroke, 5.4% for ischaemic heart disease, and 4.2% for any cause, between 2009 and 2016. Higher socioeconomic groups had higher hospitalisation rates, but the annual proportional increases were higher\nin those with lower education or income levels, those enrolled in the urban or rural resident health insurance scheme, and for those in rural areas. Lower socioeconomic groups had higher\ncase fatality rates for stroke and ischaemic heart disease, but greater reductions in case fatality rates than higher socioeconomic groups. By contrast, mean length of stay decreased by around 2%\nannually for stroke, ischaemic heart disease, and any cause, but decreased to a greater extent in higher than lower socioeconomic groups for stroke and ischaemic heart disease. INTERPRETATION: Between 2009\nand 2016, lower socioeconomic groups in China had greater increases in hospital admission rates and greater reductions in case fatality rates for stroke and ischaemic heart disease.

Despite considerable improvements in diagnosis and treatment, little is known about the short-term and long-term prognosis after a first\nstroke in low-income and middle-income countries, including China. We aimed to assess the short-term and long-term risk of recurrent stroke and mortality after a first stroke for each of the\nmajor pathological stroke types. METHODS: This population-based cohort study included adults aged 35-74 years without disability who were recruited to the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB). A baseline survey was conducted\nin ten geographical areas (five urban, five rural) in China, and participants had clinical measurements recorded. Participants were followed up by monitoring death registries and by electronic linkage to health\nregistries and health insurance claims databases, with follow-up until Jan 1, 2017. Participants were excluded from analyses if they had a previous history of stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or ischaemic\nheart disease at baseline. All incidences of fatal and non-fatal stroke during the study period were recorded by type (ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and unspecified type). Primary outcome\nmeasures were 28-day mortality, recurrent stroke, major vascular events (recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death), vascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. FINDINGS: Of 512 715 individuals in the CKB, 489\n586 participants without previous ischaemic heart disease and stroke at recruitment were included, of whom 45 732 (42 073 [92%] confirmed by brain imaging) had a stroke during the study\nperiod. The mean age was 59.3 years (SD 9.8) for participants who had a stroke (54% women) and 50.8 years (10.3) for participants with no stroke (60% women). 36 588\n(80%) of the incident cases of stroke were ischaemic stroke, 7440 (16%) were intracerebral haemorrhage, 702 (2%) were subarachnoid haemorrhage, and 1002 (2%) were an unspecified stroke type. 28-day mortality\nwas 3% (95% CI 3-4) for ischaemic stroke, 47% (46-48)for intracerebral haemorrhage, 19% (17-22; 52% for rural areas and 32% for urban areas) subarachnoid haemorrhage, and 24% (22-27) for unspecified\nstroke. Among participants who survived stroke at 28 days, 41% (41-42) had recurrent stroke at 5 years (ischaemic stroke 41% [41-42], intracerebral haemorrhage 44% [42-46], subarachnoid haemorrhage 22% [18-27], unspecified\nstroke type 40% [35-44]) and mortality at 5 years was 17% ([17-18] ischaemic stroke 16% [15-16], intracerebral haemorrhage 28% [26-29], subarachnoid haemorrhage 16% [12-20], unspecified stroke type 15% [12-19]). After\na first ischaemic stroke, 91% of recurrent strokes were also ischaemic stroke; after an intracerebral haemorrhage, 56% of recurrent strokes were intracerebral haemorrhage, and 41% of recurrent strokes were ischaemic\nstroke. INTERPRETATION: After a first stroke, the risk of recurrence or death within 5 years was high among this population of Chinese adults. Urgent improvements to secondary prevention of stroke\nin China are needed to reduce these risks.

Global health", "Creation Date": "2020/03/22 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: An estimated 5.1 million stillbirths and neonatal deaths occur annually. Household surveys, most notably the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), run in more than 90 countries and are the\nmain data source from the highest burden regions, but data-quality concerns remain. We aimed to compare two questionnaires: a full birth history module with additional questions on pregnancy losses (FBH+;\nthe current DHS standard) and a full pregnancy history module (FPH), which collects information on all livebirths, stillbirths, miscarriages, and neonatal deaths. METHODS: Women residing in five Health and Demographic\nSurveillance System sites within the INDEPTH Network (Bandim in Guinea-Bissau, Dabat in Ethiopia, IgangaMayuge in Uganda, Matlab in Bangladesh, and Kintampo in Ghana) were randomly assigned (individually) to be interviewed\nusing either FBH+ or FPH between July 28, 2017, and Aug 13, 2018. The primary outcomes were stillbirths and neonatal deaths in the 5 years before the survey interview (measured\nby stillbirth rate [SBR] and neonatal mortality rate [NMR]) and mean time taken to complete the maternity history section of the questionnaire. We also assessed between-site heterogeneity. This study is\nregistered with the Research Registry, 4720. FINDINGS: 69 176 women were allocated to be interviewed by either FBH+ (n=34 805) or FPH (n=34 371). The mean time taken to complete\nFPH (10.5 min) was longer than for FBH+ (9.1 min; p<0.0001). Using FPH, the estimated SBR was 17.4 per 1000 total births, 21% (95% CI -10 to 62) higher than\nwith FBH+ (15.2 per 1000 total births; p=0.20) in the 5 years preceding the survey interview. There was strong evidence of between-site heterogeneity (I(2)=80.9%; p<0.0001), with SBR higher for FPH\nthan for FBH+ in four of five sites. The estimated NMR did not differ between modules (FPH 25.1 per 1000 livebirths vs FBH+ 25.4 per 1000 livebirths), with no evidence\nof between-site heterogeneity (I(2)=0.7%; p=0.40). INTERPRETATION: FPH takes an average of 1.4 min longer to complete than does FBH+, but has the potential to increase reporting of stillbirths in high\nburden contexts. The between-site heterogeneity we found might reflect variations in interviewer training and survey implementation, emphasising the importance of interviewer skills, training, and consistent implementation in data quality.

METHODS: This prospective, population-based, cohort study was done in three\nLMICs (Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Tanzania) participating in the WHO Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement study. Women carrying a live singleton fetus dated by crown-rump length (CRL) measurements between\n8(+0)-14(+6) weeks of gestation, who were willing to return for two additional ultrasound scans, and who planned on delivering in the study area were enrolled in the study. Participants underwent\nultrasonography at 24(+0)-29(+6) weeks and at 30(+0)-36(+6) weeks' gestation. Birthweights were measured within 72 h of birth, and the proportions of infants who had a small-for-gestational-age birthweight (ie, a birthweight\n<10% of the standard birthweight for the infant's gestational age and sex according to the INTERGROWTH-21st project newborn baby reference standards) and appropriate-for-gestational-age birthweights were ascertained. Estimation of gestational age\nby standard fetal biometry measurements in addition to transcerebellar diameter (TCD) measurements was compared with gold-standard CRL measurements by use of Bland-Altman plots to calculate the mean difference and 95%\nlimits of agreement. Statistical modelling was done to develop new gestational age prediction formulas for third trimester ultrasonography in LMICs. FINDINGS: Between Feb 7, 2015, and Jan 9, 2017, 1947\nwomen were enrolled in the study. 1387 pregnant women had an ultrasound scan at 24(+0)-29(+6) weeks of gestation and 1403 had an ultrasound scan between 30(+0)-36(+6) weeks of gestation. Of\nthe 1379 unique infants whose birthweights were available, 981 (71.1%) infants were born with an appropriate-for-gestational-age birthweight and 398 (28.9%) infants were born with a small-for-gestational-age birthweight. The accuracy of\nlate pregnancy ultrasound biometry using existing formulas to estimate gestational age in LMICs was similar to that in high-income settings. With standard dating formulas, late pregnancy ultrasound at 24(+0)-29(+6) weeks'\ngestation was accurate to within approximately plus or minus 2 weeks of the gold-standard CRL measurement of gestational age, and late pregnancy ultrasound was accurate to within +/-3 weeks of\nthe CRL measurement at 30(+0)-36(+6) weeks' gestation. In infants who were ultimately born small for gestational age, individual parameters systematically underestimated gestational age, apart from TCD, which showed minimal bias.\nBy use of a novel parsimonious model formula that combined TCD with femur length, gestational age at the 24(+0) -29(+6)-week ultrasound scan was estimated to within +/-10.5 days of the\nCRL measurement and estimated to within +/-15.1 days of the CRL measurement at the 30(+0)-36(+6)-week ultrasound scan. Similar results were observed in infants who were small-for-gestational-age. INTERPRETATION: Incorporation of TCD\nand the use of new formulas in late pregnancy ultrasound scans could improve the accuracy of gestational age estimation in both appropriate-for-gestational-age and small-for-gestational-age infants in LMICs. Given the high\nrates of small-for-gestational-age infants in LMICs, these results might be especially relevant. Validation of this new formula in other LMIC populations is needed to establish whether the accuracy of the\nlate pregnancy ultrasound can be narrowed to within approximately 2 weeks.

However, most people with dementia live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where dementia\nrisk prediction research is almost non-existent and the ability of current models to predict dementia is unknown. This study investigated whether dementia prediction models developed in HICs are applicable to\nLMICs. METHODS: Data were from the 10/66 Study. Individuals aged 65 years or older and without dementia at baseline were selected from China, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Puerto\nRico, and Venezuela. Dementia incidence was assessed over 3-5 years, with diagnosis according to the 10/66 Study diagnostic algorithm. Discrimination and calibration were tested for five models: the Cardiovascular Risk\nFactors, Aging and Dementia risk score (CAIDE); the Study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia (AgeCoDe) model; the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI); the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator\n(BDSI); and the Rotterdam Study Basic Dementia Risk Model (BDRM). Models were tested with use of Cox regression. The discriminative accuracy of each model was assessed using Harrell's concordance (c)-statistic,\nwith a value of 0.70 or higher considered to indicate acceptable discriminative ability. Calibration (model fit) was assessed statistically using the Gronnesby and Borgan test. FINDINGS: 11 143 individuals without\nbaseline dementia and with available follow-up data were included in the analysis. During follow-up (mean 3.8 years [SD 1.3]), 1069 people progressed to dementia across all sites (incidence rate 24.9\ncases per 1000 person-years). Performance of the models varied. Across countries, the discriminative ability of the CAIDE (0.52</=c</=0.63) and AgeCoDe (0.57</=c</=0.74) models was poor. By contrast, the ANU-ADRI (0.66</=c</=0.78), BDSI\n(0.62</=c</=0.78), and BDRM (0.66</=c</=0.78) models showed similar levels of discriminative ability to those of the development cohorts. All models showed good calibration, especially at low and intermediate levels of predicted\nrisk. The models validated best in Peru and poorest in the Dominican Republic and China. INTERPRETATION: Not all dementia prediction models developed in HICs can be simply extrapolated to LMICs.\nFurther work defining what number and which combination of risk variables works best for predicting risk of dementia in LMICs is needed. However, models that transport well could be used\nimmediately for dementia prevention research and targeted risk reduction in LMICs.

Global health", "Creation Date": "2020/03/22 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The reduction by a third of premature non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality by 2030 is the ambitious target of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4. However, the indicator is narrowly defined,\nincluding only four major NCDs (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases) and only for people aged 30-70 years. This study focuses on premature avertable mortality from NCDs-premature deaths\ncaused by NCDs that could be prevented through effective public policies and health interventions or amenable to high-quality health care-to assess trends at global, regional, and national levels using estimates\nfrom the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017. METHODS: We reviewed existing lists of NCD causes of death that are either preventable through public health\npolicies and interventions or amenable to health care to create a list of avertable NCD causes of death, which was mapped to the GBD cause list. We estimated age-standardised years\nof life lost (YLL) per 100 000 population due to premature avertable mortality from NCDs, avertable NCD cause clusters, and non-avertable NCD causes by sex, location, and year and reported\ntheir 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We examined trends in age-standardised YLL due to avertable and non-avertable NCDs, assessed the progress of premature avertable mortality from NCDs in achieving SDG 3.4,\nand explored specific avertable NCD cause clusters that could make a substantial contribution to overall trends in premature mortality. FINDINGS: Globally, premature avertable mortality from NCDs for both sexes combined\ndeclined -1.3% (95% UI -1.4 to -1.2) per year, from 12 855 years (11 809 to 14 051) in 1990 to 9008 years (8329 to 9756) in 2017. However, the\nabsolute number of avertable NCD deaths increased 49.3% (95% UI 47.3 to 52.2) from 23.1 million (22.0-24.1) deaths in 1990 to 34.5 million (33.4 to 35.6) in 2017. Premature avertable\nmortality from NCDs reduced in every WHO region and in most countries and territories between 1990 and 2017. Despite these reductions, only the Western Pacific and European regions and 25\ncountries (most of which are high-income countries) are on track to achieve SDG target 3.4. Since 2017, there has been a global slowdown in the reduction of premature avertable mortality\nfrom NCDs. In 2017, high premature avertable mortality from NCDs was clustered in low-income and middle-income countries, mainly in the South-East Asia region, Eastern Mediterranean region, and African region. Most\ncountries with large annual reductions in such mortality between 1990 and 2017 had achieved low levels of premature avertable mortality from NCDs by 2017. Some countries, the most populous examples\nbeing Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Uzbekistan, Haiti, Mongolia, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Ukraine, Laos, and Egypt, reported both an upward trend and high levels of premature avertable mortality from NCDs. Cardiovascular\ndiseases, cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases have been the main drivers of the global and regional reduction in premature avertable mortality from NCDs, whereas premature mortality from substance use disorders,\nchronic kidney disease and acute glomerulonephritis, and diabetes have been increasing. INTERPRETATION: Worldwide, there has been a substantial reduction in premature avertable mortality from NCDs, but progress has been uneven\nacross populations. Countries vary substantially in current levels and trends and, hence, the extent to which they are on track to achieve SDG 3.4. By accounting for premature avertable mortality\nwhile avoiding arbitrary age cutoffs, premature avertable mortality from NCDs is a robust, comprehensive, and actionable indicator for quantifying and monitoring global and national progress towards NCD prevention and control.\nFUNDING: None.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32199120", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32199119", "Title": "Industry-sponsored antismoking advertisements in low-income countries.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

Although incurable, prion disease follows a clear pathogenic mechanism, in which a single gene gives rise to a single\nprion protein (PrP) capable of converting into the sole causal disease agent, the misfolded prion. As efforts progress to leverage this mechanistic knowledge toward rational therapies, a principal challenge will\nbe the design of clinical trials. Previous trials in prion disease have been done in symptomatic patients who are often profoundly debilitated at enrolment. About 15% of prion disease cases\nare genetic, creating an opportunity for early therapeutic intervention to delay or prevent disease. Highly variable age of onset and absence of established prodromal biomarkers might render infeasible existing models\nfor testing drugs before disease onset. Advancement of near-term targeted therapeutics could crucially depend on thoughtful design of rigorous presymptomatic trials.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32199098", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32199097", "Title": "Nusinersen in adults with 5q spinal muscular atrophy: a non-interventional, multicentre, observational cohort study.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

Although clinical trials have shown improvements in motor\nfunction in infants and children treated with the drug, data for adults are scarce. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of nusinersen in adults with 5q spinal muscular\natrophy. METHODS: We did an observational cohort study at ten academic clinical sites in Germany. Patients with genetically confirmed 5q spinal muscular atrophy (age 16-65 years) with a homozygous deletion\nof exons 7, 8, or both, or with compound heterozygous mutations were eligible for inclusion and received nusinersen treatment in accordance with the label for a minimum treatment time of\n6 months to a follow-up of up to 14 months. The primary outcome was the change in the total Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) score, assessed at months 6,\n10, and 14, and based on pre-post comparisons. This study is registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (number DRKS00015702). FINDINGS: Between July 13, 2017, and May 1, 2019, 173\npatients were screened, of whom 139 (80%) were eligible for data analysis. Of these, 124 (89%) were included in the 6-month analysis, 92 (66%) in the 10-month analysis, and 57\n(41%) in the 14-month analysis; patients with missing baseline HFMSE scores were excluded from these analyses. Mean HFMSE scores were significantly increased compared with baseline at 6 months (mean difference\n1.73 [95% CI 1.05-2.41], p<0.0001), 10 months (2.58 [1.76-3.39], p<0.0001), and 14 months (3.12 [2.06-4.19], p<0.0001). Clinically meaningful improvements (>/=3 points increase) in HFMSE scores were seen in 35 (28%)\nof 124 patients at 6 months, 33 (35%) of 92 at 10 months, and 23 (40%) of 57 at 14 months. To 14-month follow-up, the most frequent adverse effects among\n173 patients were headache (61 [35%] patients), back pain (38 [22%]), and nausea (19 [11%]). No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Despite the limitations of the observational study design\nand a slow functional decline throughout the natural disease course, our data provide evidence for the safety and efficacy of nusinersen in the treatment of adults with 5q spinal muscular\natrophy, with clinically meaningful improvements in motor function in a real-world cohort.

Neurology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/22 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-efficacy therapies in multiple sclerosis are traditionally used after unsuccessful treatment with first-line disease modifying therapies. We hypothesised that early commencement of high-efficacy therapy would be associated with reduced\nlong-term disability. We therefore aimed to compare long-term disability outcomes between patients who started high-efficacy therapies within 2 years of disease onset with those who started 4-6 years after disease\nonset. METHODS: In this retrospective international observational study, we obtained data from the MSBase registry and the Swedish MS registry, which prospectively collect patient data that are specific to multiple\nsclerosis as part of routine clinical care. We identified adult patients (aged >/=18 years) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with at least 6 years of follow-up since disease onset, and who\nstarted the high-efficacy therapy (rituximab, ocrelizumab, mitoxantrone, alemtuzumab, or natalizumab) either 0-2 years (early) or 4-6 years (late) after clinical disease onset. We matched patients in the early and late\ngroups using propensity scores calculated on the basis of their baseline clinical and demographic data. The primary outcome was disability, measured with the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS; an ordinal\nscale of 0-10, with higher scores indicating increased disability), at 6-10 years after disease onset, assessed with a linear mixed-effects model. FINDINGS: We identified 6149 patients in the MSBase registry\nwho had been given high-efficacy therapy, with data collected between Jan 1, 1975, and April 13, 2017, and 2626 patients in the Swedish MS Registry, with data collected between Dec\n10, 1997, and Sept 16, 2019. Of whom, 308 in the MSBase registry and 236 in the Swedish MS registry were eligible for inclusion. 277 (51%) of 544 patients commenced\ntherapy early and 267 (49%) commenced therapy late. For the primary analysis, we matched 213 patients in the early treatment group with 253 in the late treatment group. At baseline,\nthe mean EDSS score was 2.2 (SD 1.2) in the early group and 2.1 (SD 1.2) in the late group. Median follow-up time for matched patients was 7.8 years (IQR\n6.7-8.9). In the sixth year after disease onset, the mean EDSS score was 2.2 (SD 1.6) in the early group compared with 2.9 (SD 1.8) in the late group (p<0.0001).\nThis difference persisted throughout each year of follow-up until the tenth year after disease onset (mean EDSS score 2.3 [SD 1.8] vs 3.5 [SD 2.1]; p<0.0001), with a difference between\ngroups of -0.98 (95% CI -1.51 to -0.45; p<0.0001, adjusted for proportion of time on any disease-modifying therapy) across the 6-10 year follow-up period. INTERPRETATION: High-efficacy therapy commenced within 2\nyears of disease onset is associated with less disability after 6-10 years than when commenced later in the disease course. This finding can inform decisions regarding optimal sequence and timing\nof multiple sclerosis therapy.

We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody,\nagainst relapses in patients with NMOSD. METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at eight hospitals in Japan. Patients aged 16-80 years with NMOSD who were seropositive\nfor aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibody, were taking 5-30 mg/day oral steroids, and had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 7.0 or less were eligible for the study. Individuals\ntaking any other immunosuppressants were excluded. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) either rituximab or placebo by a computer-aided dynamic random allocation system. The doses of concomitant steroid (converted to equivalent\ndoses of prednisolone) and relapses in previous 2 years were set as stratification factors. Participants and those assessing outcomes were unaware of group assignments. Rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) was administered intravenously\nevery week for 4 weeks, then 6-month interval dosing was done (1000 mg every 2 weeks, at 24 weeks and 48 weeks after randomisation). A matching placebo was administered intravenously.\nConcomitant oral prednisolone was gradually reduced to 2-5 mg/day, according to the protocol. The primary outcome was time to first relapse within 72 weeks. Relapses were defined as patient-reported symptoms\nor any new signs consistent with CNS lesions and attributable objective changes in MRI or visual evoked potential. The primary analysis was done in the full analysis set (all randomly\nassigned patients) and safety analyses were done in the safety analysis set (all patients who received at least one infusion of assigned treatment). The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat principles.\nThis trial is registered with the UMIN clinical trial registry, UMIN000013453. FINDINGS: Between May 10, 2014, and Aug 15, 2017, 38 participants were recruited and randomly allocated either rituximab (n=19)\nor placebo (n=19). Three (16%) patients assigned rituximab discontinued the study and were analysed as censored cases. Seven (37%) relapses occurred in patients allocated placebo and none were recorded in\npatients assigned rituximab (group difference 36.8%, 95% CI 12.3-65.5; log-rank p=0.0058). Eight serious adverse events were recorded, four events in three (16%) patients assigned rituximab (lumbar compression fracture and infection\naround nail of right foot [n=1], diplopia [n=1], and uterine cancer [n=1]) and four events in two (11%) people allocated to placebo (exacerbation of glaucoma and bleeding in the right\neye chamber after surgery [n=1], and visual impairment and asymptomatic white matter brain lesion on MRI [n=1]); all patients recovered. No deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: Rituximab prevented relapses for 72\nweeks in patients with NMOSD who were AQP4 antibody-positive. This study is limited by its small sample size and inclusion of participants with mild disease activity. However, our results suggest\nthat rituximab could be useful maintenance therapy for individuals with NMOSD who are AQP4 antibody-positive.

We assessed the immunogenicity and safety of three different dose\nschedules of a tetravalent dengue vaccine (TAK-003) over a 48-month period in children living in dengue-endemic countries. METHODS: We did a large, phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at three sites\nin the Dominican Republic, Panama, and the Philippines. Healthy participants aged 2-17 years were randomly assigned 1:2:5:1 using an interactive web response system with stratification by age to receive either\na two-dose primary series (days 1 and 91), one primary dose (day 1), one primary dose plus booster (days 1 and 365), or placebo. Participants and relevant study personnel were\nmasked to the random assignment until completion of the study at month 48. To maintain masking, TAK-003 recipients were administered placebo doses when appropriate. The primary objective was assessment of\nneutralising geometric mean titres for each serotype to month 48 assessed in the per-protocol immunogenicity subset. Secondary safety endpoints included proportions of participants with serious adverse events and symptomatic virologically\nconfirmed dengue. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02302066. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2014, and Feb 13, 2015, 1800 children were randomly assigned to the following groups: two-dose primary series\n(n=201), one primary dose (n=398), one primary dose plus 1-year booster (n=1002), and placebo (n=199). Of them, 1479 (82%) participants completed the 48-month study. Immunogenicity endpoints were assessed in 562\nparticipants enrolled in the immunogenicity subset, of whom 509 were included in the per-protocol subset. At month 48, antibody titres remained elevated in all TAK-003 groups compared with placebo, irrespective\nof baseline serostatus. At month 48, geometric mean titres were 378 (95% CI 226-632) in two-dose, 421 (285-622) in one-dose, 719 (538-960) in one-dose plus 1-year booster, and 100 (50-201)\nin placebo recipients against DENV 1; 1052 (732-1511), 1319 (970-1794), 1200 (927-1553), and 208 (99-437) against DENV 2; 183 (113-298), 201 (135-298), 288 (211-392), and 71 (37-139) against DENV 3;\nand 152 (97-239), 164 (114-236), 219 (165-290), and 46 (26-82) against DENV 4; and tetravalent seropositivity rate was 89% (79-96), 86% (80-92), 97% (93-99), and 60% (47-72), respectively. Virologically confirmed\ndengue was recorded in 37 (2%) TAK-003 and 13 (7%) placebo participants, with a relative risk of 0.35 (0.19-0.65). No vaccine-related serious adverse events or severe dengue virus disease were\nreported. INTERPRETATION: TAK-003 elicited antibody responses against all four serotypes, which persisted to 48 months post-vaccination, regardless of baseline serostatus. No important safety risks were identified. We observed a long-term\nreduction in risk of symptomatic dengue virus disease in vaccinees.

We aimed to\nassess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (TAK-003) in healthy children aged 4-16 years. METHODS: We present data up to 18 months post-vaccination from\nan ongoing phase 3, randomised, double-blind trial of TAK-003 in endemic regions of Asia and Latin America (26 medical and research centres across Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama, Philippines,\nSri Lanka, and Thailand). Healthy children aged 4-16 years were randomly assigned 2:1 (stratified by age and region) to receive two doses of TAK-003 or two doses of placebo, 3\nmonths apart. Investigators, participants and their parents or guardians, and sponsor representatives advising on trial conduct were masked to trial group assignments. Participants presenting with febrile illness were tested for\nvirologically confirmed dengue (VCD) by serotype-specific RT-PCR. In timeframes beginning 30 days post-second dose, the primary endpoint (overall vaccine efficacy) was assessed in the first 11 months, and the secondary\nendpoints (efficacy by baseline serostatus, serotype, hospitalised dengue, and severe dengue) in the first 17 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02747927. FINDINGS: 20 099 participants were randomly assigned\nand vaccinated between Sept 7, 2016, and Aug 18, 2017; 19 021 (94.6%) were included in the per protocol analysis, and 20 071 (99.9%) in the safety set. The primary\nendpoint was achieved with an overall vaccine efficacy of 80.2% (95% CI 73.3 to 85.3; 61 cases of VCD in the TAK-003 group vs 149 cases of VCD in the\nplacebo group). In the secondary endpoint assessment timeframe, an overall vaccine efficacy of 73.3% (95% CI 66.5 to 78.8) was observed. Analysis of secondary endpoints showed efficacies of 76.1% (95%\nCI 68.5 to 81.9) in individuals who were seropositive at baseline, 66.2% (49.1 to 77.5) in individuals who were seronegative at baseline, 90.4% (82.6 to 94.7) against hospitalised dengue, and\n85.9% (31.9 to 97.1) against dengue haemorrhagic fever. Efficacy varied by individual serotypes (DENV 1, 69.8% [95% CI 54.8 to 79.9]; DENV 2, 95.1% [89.9 to 97.6]; DENV 3, 48.9%\n[27.2 to 64.1]; DENV 4, 51.0% [-69.4 to 85.8]). Cumulative rates of serious adverse events were similar in TAK-003 (4.0%) and placebo (4.8%) recipients, and were consistent with expected medical\ndisorders in the study population. Infection was the most frequent reason leading to serious adverse events. 20 participants (<0.1% of the safety set) were withdrawn from the trial due to\n21 adverse events by the end of part two; 14 of these participants received TAK-003 and six received placebo. INTERPRETATION: TAK-003 was well tolerated and efficacious against symptomatic dengue in\nchildren regardless of serostatus before immunisation.

In response, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (with support from PricewaterhouseCoopers)\ncoordinated subject matter experts to create a preparedness plan for Disease X. Disease X is caused by Pathogen X, an infectious agent that is not currently known to cause human\ndisease, but an aetiologic agent of a future outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential. We have identified crucial areas for acceleration in medical countermeasure product development and international coordination. We\nhave also reviewed novel platforms and process improvements related to manufacturing, which could revolutionise the response to the next pandemic. Finally, we created several coordination and engagement guides. These guides\nrange from the rational design of an intervention target product profile, to the key facets of vaccine and therapeutic development, to accelerated manufacturing and regulatory mechanisms. In this Personal View,\nwe provide a high-level summary of the outcomes of the medical countermeasure development workstream, intended for a broad audience including academia, medical countermeasure developers, and multilateral coordinating bodies. We hope\nthat they might find this piece useful in prioritising strategic investments and efforts to accelerate medical countermeasure development.

Psychiatry", "Creation Date": "2020/03/21 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 188 million people use cannabis yearly worldwide, and it has recently been legalised in 11 US states, Canada, and Uruguay for recreational use. The potential for increased cannabis\nuse highlights the need to better understand its risks, including the acute induction of psychotic and other psychiatric symptoms. We aimed to investigate the effect of the cannabis constituent Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol\n(THC) alone and in combination with cannabidiol (CBD) compared with placebo on psychiatric symptoms in healthy people. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO\nfor studies published in English between database inception and May 21, 2019, with a within-person, crossover design. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting symptoms using psychiatric scales (the Brief Psychiatric Rating\nScale [BPRS] and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]) following the acute administration of intravenous, oral, or nasal THC, CBD, and placebo in healthy participants, and presenting data that\nallowed calculation of standardised mean change (SMC) scores for positive (including delusions and hallucinations), negative (such as blunted affect and amotivation), and general (including depression and anxiety) symptoms. We did\na random-effects meta-analysis to assess the main outcomes of the effect sizes for total, positive, and negative PANSS and BPRS scores measured in healthy participants following THC administration versus placebo.\nBecause the number of studies to do a meta-analysis on CBD's moderating effects was insufficient, this outcome was only systematically reviewed. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019136674. FINDINGS: 15\neligible studies involving the acute administration of THC and four studies on CBD plus THC administration were identified. Compared with placebo, THC significantly increased total symptom severity with a large\neffect size (assessed in nine studies, with ten independent samples, involving 196 participants: SMC 1.10 [95% CI 0.92-1.28], p<0.0001); positive symptom severity (assessed in 14 studies, with 15 independent samples,\ninvolving 324 participants: SMC 0.91 [95% CI 0.68-1.14], p<0.0001); and negative symptom severity with a large effect size (assessed in 12 studies, with 13 independent samples, involving 267 participants: SMC\n0.78 [95% CI 0.59-0.97], p<0.0001). In the systematic review, of the four studies evaluating CBD's effects on THC-induced symptoms, only one identified a significant reduction in symptoms. INTERPRETATION: A single\nTHC administration induces psychotic, negative, and other psychiatric symptoms with large effect sizes. There is no consistent evidence that CBD induces symptoms or moderates the effects of THC.

We aimed to assess colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in individuals with removal of different histological subtypes\nof polyps relative to the general population. METHODS: We did a matched cohort study through prospective record linkage in Sweden in patients aged at least 18 years with a first\ndiagnosis of colorectal polyps in the nationwide gastrointestinal ESPRESSO histopathology cohort (1993-2016). For each polyp case, we identified up to five matched reference individuals from the Total Population Register on\nthe basis of birth year, age, sex, calendar year of biopsy, and county of residence. We excluded patients and reference individuals with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer either before or\nwithin the first 6 months after diagnosis of the index polyp. Polyps were classified by morphology codes into hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated polyps, tubular adenomas, tubulovillous adenomas, and villous adenomas.\nColorectal cancer cases were identified from the Swedish Cancer Registry, and cause-of-death data were retrieved from the Cause of Death Register. We collected information about the use of endoscopic examination\nbefore and after the index biopsy from the Swedish National Patient Registry, and counted the number of endoscopies done before and after the index biopsies. We calculated cumulative risk of\ncolorectal cancer incidence and mortality at 3, 5, 10, and 15 years, and computed hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for colorectal cancer incidence and mortality using a stratified Cox\nproportional hazards model within each of the matched pairs. FINDINGS: 178 377 patients with colorectal polyps and 864 831 matched reference individuals from the general population were included in our\nstudy. The mean age of patients at polyp diagnosis was 58.6 (SD 13.9) years for hyperplastic polyps, 59.7 (14.2) years for sessile serrated polyps, 63.9 (12.9) years for tubular adenomas,\n67.1 (12.1) years for tubulovillous adenomas, and 68.9 (11.8) years for villous adenomas. During a median of 6.6 years (IQR 3.0-11.6) of follow-up, we documented 4278 incident colorectal cancers and\n1269 colorectal cancer-related deaths in patients with a polyp, and 14 350 incident colorectal cancers and 5242 colorectal cancer deaths in general reference individuals. The 10-year cumulative incidence of colorectal\ncancer was 1.6% (95% CI 1.5-1.7) for hyperplastic polyps, 2.5% (1.9-3.3) for sessile serrated polyps, 2.7% (2.5-2.9) for tubular adenomas, 5.1% (4.8-5.4) for tubulovillous adenomas, and 8.6% (7.4-10.1) for villous\nadenomas compared with 2.1% (2.0-2.1) in reference individuals. Compared with reference individuals, patients with any polyps had an increased risk of colorectal cancer, with multivariable HR of 1.11 (95% CI\n1.02-1.22) for hyperplastic polyps, 1.77 (1.34-2.34) for sessile serrated polyps, 1.41 (1.30-1.52) for tubular adenomas, 2.56 (2.36-2.78) for tubulovillous adenomas, and 3.82 (3.07-4.76) for villous adenomas (p<0.05 for all polyp\nsubtypes). There was a higher proportion of incident proximal colon cancer in patients with serrated (hyperplastic and sessile) polyps (52-57%) than in those with conventional (tubular, tubulovillous, and villous) adenomas\n(30-46%). For colorectal cancer mortality, a positive association was found for sessile serrated polyps (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.08-2.79), tubulovillous adenomas (1.95, 1.69-2.24), and villous adenomas (3.45, 2.40-4.95), but not\nfor hyperplastic polyps (0.90, 0.76-1.06) or tubular adenomas (0.97, 0.84-1.12). INTERPRETATION: In a largely screening-naive population, compared with individuals from the general population, patients with any polyps had a higher\ncolorectal cancer incidence, and those with sessile serrated polyps, tubulovillous adenomas, and villous adenomas had a higher colorectal cancer mortality.

These drugs are associated with numerous adverse events that can cause severe morbidity, such as\ndeafness, and in some instances can lead to death. Our aim was to estimate the absolute and relative frequency of adverse events associated with different tuberculosis drugs to provide useful\ninformation for clinicians and tuberculosis programmes in selecting optimal treatment regimens. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis using individual-level patient data that were obtained from studies that reported adverse events that\nresulted in permanent discontinuation of anti-tuberculosis medications. We used a database created for our previous meta-analysis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment and outcomes, for which we did a systematic review of\nliterature published between Jan 1, 2009, and Aug 31, 2015 (updated April 15, 2016), and requested individual patient-level information from authors. We also considered for this analysis studies contributing patient-level\ndata in response to a public call made by WHO in 2018. Meta-analysis for proportions and arm-based network meta-analysis were done to estimate the incidence of adverse events for each\ntuberculosis drug. FINDINGS: 58 studies were identified, including 50 studies from the updated individual patient data meta-analysis for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment. 35 of these studies, with 9178 patients, were included\nin our analysis. Using meta-analysis of proportions, drugs with low risks of adverse event occurrence leading to permanent discontinuation included levofloxacin (1.3% [95% CI 0.3-5.0]), moxifloxacin (2.9% [1.6-5.0]), bedaquiline (1.7%\n[0.7-4.2]), and clofazimine (1.6% [0.5-5.3]). Relatively high incidence of adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation was seen with three second-line injectable drugs (amikacin: 10.2% [6.3-16.0]; kanamycin: 7.5% [4.6-11.9]; capreomycin: 8.2%\n[6.3-10.7]), aminosalicylic acid (11.6% [7.1-18.3]), and linezolid (14.1% [9.9-19.6]). Risk of bias in selection of studies was judged to be low because there were no important differences between included and\nexcluded studies. Variability between studies was significant for most outcomes analysed. INTERPRETATION: Fluoroquinolones, clofazimine, and bedaquiline had the lowest incidence of adverse events leading to permanent drug discontinuation, whereas second-line\ninjectable drugs, aminosalicylic acid, and linezolid had the highest incidence. These results suggest that close monitoring of adverse events is important for patients being treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Our results\nalso underscore the urgent need for safer and better-tolerated drugs to reduce morbidity from treatment itself for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

We did a phase 1-2 study of\nnivolumab, a PD-1 blocking monoclonal antibody, to determine its safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumour activity in children and young adults with recurrent or refractory non-CNS solid tumours or lymphoma. METHODS: We\ndid a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, dose-confirmation and dose-expansion, phase 1-2 trial in 23 hospitals in the USA. Eligible patients for part A (dose-confirmation phase) of the study were aged 1-18\nyears with solid tumours with measurable or evaluable disease (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) regardless of histology. Eligible patients for part B (dose-expansion phase) were\naged 1-30 years with measurable disease (by RECIST criteria) in the following disease cohorts: rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and melanoma. Patients in part A and\nwere given nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously over 60 min on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle in a rolling 6 study design with de-escalation upon dose-limiting toxicities to\nestablish the recommended phase 2 dose. Patients in part B were given the recommended phase 2 dose. The primary outcomes were the tolerability, systemic exposure, maximum tolerated dose, and the\nantitumour activity of nivolumab at the adult recommended dose in children and young adults. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02304458, with follow-up ongoing and is closed to new participants.\nFINDINGS: 85 patients were enrolled between Feb 22, 2015, and Dec 31, 2018, and 75 patients were fully evaluable for toxicity. Median follow-up was 30 days (IQR 27-83). In part\nA, 13 patients were enrolled and 12 were evaluable for toxicity. There were no dose de-escalations or dose-limiting toxicities and nivolumab 3 mg/kg was confirmed as the paediatric recommended phase\n2. 72 patients were enrolled in part B and 63 were evaluable for toxicity. Five (7%) patients in part B had dose-limiting toxicities. The most common overall toxicity was anaemia\n(35 [47%] of 75 patients; five patients had grade 3 or grade 4) and non-haematological toxicity was fatigue (28 [37%] patients; none had grade 3 or grade 4). Responses were\nobserved in patients with lymphoma (three [30%] of ten with Hodgkin lymphoma and one [10%] of ten with non-Hodgkin lymphoma; all responders had PD-L1 expression). Objective responses were not observed\nin other tumour types. INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab was safe and well tolerated in children and young adults and showed clinical activity in lymphoma. Nivolumab showed no significant single-agent activity in the\ncommon paediatric solid tumours. This study defines the recommended phase 2 dose and establishes a favourable safety profile for nivolumab in children and young adults, which can serve as the\nbasis for its potential study in combinatorial regimens for childhood cancer.

Different types of complexion and transitions between complexions have been characterized, mostly in binary or multicomponent systems(8-19).

The model is thought to capture the\nessential physics of high-temperature superconductors, magnetic insulators and other complex quantum many-body ground states(2,3). Although the Hubbard model provides a greatly simplified representation of most real materials, it is nevertheless\ndifficult to solve accurately except in the one-dimensional case(2,3). Therefore, the physical realization of the Hubbard model in two or three dimensions, which can act as an analogue quantum simulator\n(that is, it can mimic the model and simulate its phase diagram and dynamics(4,5)), has a vital role in solving the strong-correlation puzzle, namely, revealing the physics of a large\nnumber of strongly interacting quantum particles. Here we obtain the phase diagram of the two-dimensional triangular-lattice Hubbard model by studying angle-aligned WSe2/WS2 bilayers, which form moire superlattices(6) because of the\ndifference between the lattice constants of the two materials. We probe the charge and magnetic properties of the system by measuring the dependence of its optical response on an out-of-plane\nmagnetic field and on the gate-tuned carrier density. At half-filling of the first hole moire superlattice band, we observe a Mott insulating state with antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss behaviour, as expected for\na Hubbard model in the strong-interaction regime(2,3,7-9). Above half-filling, our experiment suggests a possible quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a weak ferromagnetic state at filling factors near 0.6.\nOur results establish a new solid-state platform based on moire superlattices that can be used to simulate problems in strong-correlation physics that are described by triangular-lattice Hubbard models.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188950", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32188949", "Title": "Automated radial synthesis of organic molecules.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/20 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "Automated synthesis platforms accelerate and simplify the preparation of molecules by removing the physical barriers to organic synthesis.

REVIEW METHODS: Studies were included if they compared at least one time point before and one\ntime point after media reports on suicide; follow-up was two months or less; the outcome was death by suicide; and the media reports were about non-fictional suicides. Data from studies\nadopting an interrupted time series design, or single or multiple arm before and after comparisons, were reviewed. RESULTS: 31 studies were identified and analysed, and 20 studies at moderate risk\nof bias were included in the main analyses. The risk of suicide increased by 13% in the period after the media reported a death of a celebrity by suicide (rate\nratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.18; 14 studies; median follow-up 28 days, range 7-60 days).

This review explores how management of AAV has evolved over\nthe past two decades with pivotal randomized controlled trials shaping the management of induction and maintenance of remission. Contemporary AAV care is characterized by approaches that minimize the cumulative exposure\nto cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids, increasingly use rituximab for remission induction and maintenance, and consider therapies with less toxicity (for example, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil) for manifestations of AAV that do not\nthreaten organ function or survival. Simultaneously, improvements in outcomes, such as renal and overall survival, have been observed. Additional trials and observational studies evaluating the comparative effectiveness of agents for\nAAV in various patient subgroups are needed. Prospective studies are necessary to assess the effect of psychosocial interventions on patient reported outcomes in AAV. Despite the expanding array of treatments\nfor AAV, little guidance on how to personalize AAV care is available to physicians.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188597", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32188596", "Title": "David Oliver: Why force GP streaming on NHS emergency departments?", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/20 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188596", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32188595", "Title": "Suicide and the media: reporting could cost lives.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/21 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188595", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32188592", "Title": "Big cannabis in the UK: is industry support for wider patient access motivated by promises of recreational market worth billions?", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/20 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188592", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32188591", "Title": "Tobacco cash behind cannabis research in Oxford.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/20 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188591", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32188589", "Title": "Uterine fibroid drug is recalled after case of liver failure requiring transplant prompts EU review.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/20 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188589", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32188588", "Title": "Industry's plan to accelerate prescribing of medical cannabis.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/20 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188588", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32188587", "Title": "Associations of fat and carbohydrate intake with cardiovascular disease and mortality: prospective cohort study of UK Biobank participants.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/24 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of macronutrient intake with all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and the implications for dietary advice. DESIGN: Prospective population based study. SETTING: UK Biobank.\nPARTICIPANTS: 195 658 of the 502 536 participants in UK Biobank completed at least one dietary questionnaire and were included in the analyses. Diet was assessed using Oxford WebQ, a\nweb based 24 hour recall questionnaire, and nutrient intakes were estimated using standard methodology. Cox proportional models with penalised cubic splines were used to study non-linear associations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nAll cause mortality and incidence of CVD. RESULTS: 4780 (2.4%) participants died over a mean 10.6 (range 9.4-13.9) years of follow-up, and 948 (0.5%) and 9776 (5.0%) experienced fatal and\nnon-fatal CVD events, respectively, over a mean 9.7 (range 8.5-13.0) years of follow-up. Non-linear associations were found for many macronutrients. Carbohydrate intake showed a non-linear association with mortality; no association\nat 20-50% of total energy intake but a positive association at 50-70% of energy intake (3.14 v 2.75 per 1000 person years, average hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.03\nto 1.28 (60-70% v 50% of energy)). A similar pattern was observed for sugar but not for starch or fibre. A higher intake of monounsaturated fat (2.94 v 3.50 per\n1000 person years, average hazard ratio 0.58, 0.51 to 0.66 (20-25% v 5% of energy)) and lower intake of polyunsaturated fat (2.66 v 3.04 per 1000 person years, 0.78, 0.75\nto 0.81 (5-7% v 12% of energy)) and saturated fat (2.66 v 3.59 per 1000 person years, 0.67, 0.62 to 0.73 (5-10% v 20% of energy)) were associated with a\nlower risk of mortality. A dietary risk matrix was developed to illustrate how dietary advice can be given based on current intake. CONCLUSION: Many associations between macronutrient intake and health\noutcomes are non-linear. Thus dietary advice could be tailored to current intake. Dietary guidelines on macronutrients (eg, carbohydrate) should also take account of differential associations of its components (eg, sugar\nand starch).", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188587", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32188586", "Title": "Covid-19: pregnant doctors should speak to occupational health, say experts.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/20 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188586", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32186687", "Title": "Cardiovascular Corner-Stable Coronary Artery Disease, An LDL \"Vaccine,\" and Anti-inflammatories.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/19 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32186687", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32186661", "Title": "Presidential Powers and Response to COVID-19.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/19 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32186661", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32186660", "Title": "Confirmatory Trial for Drug to Prevent Preterm Birth Finds No Benefit, So Why Is It Still Prescribed?", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/19 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 18", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32186660", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32184490", "Title": "Coronavirus: three things all governments and their science advisers must do now.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/19 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32184490", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32184489", "Title": "A year without conferences?

Given that these recommendations are based\non research performed outside the United States, it is uncertain whether these findings also reflect the US experience. Objective: To compare the outcomes associated with cemented vs uncemented hemiarthroplasty in\na large US integrated health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of 12491 patients aged 60 years and older who underwent hemiarthroplasty treatment of a hip fracture\nbetween 2009 and 2017 at 1 of the 36 hospitals owned by Kaiser Permanente, a large US health maintenance organization. Patients were followed up until membership termination, death, or the\nstudy end date of December 31, 2017. Exposures: Hemiarthroplasty (prosthetic replacement of the femoral head) fixation via bony growth into a porous-coated implant (uncemented) or with cement. Main Outcomes and\nMeasures: The primary outcome measure was aseptic revision, defined as any reoperation performed after the index procedure involving exchange of the existing implant for reasons other than infection. Secondary outcomes\nwere mortality (in-hospital, postdischarge, and overall), 90-day medical complications, 90-day emergency department visits, and 90-day unplanned readmissions. Results: Among 12491 patients in the study cohort who underwent hemiarthroplasty for hip\nfracture (median age, 83 years; 8660 women [69.3%]), 6042 (48.4%) had undergone uncemented fixation and 6449 (51.6%) had undergone cemented fixation, and the median length of follow-up was 3.8 years.\nIn the multivariable regression analysis controlling for confounders, uncemented fixation was associated with a significantly higher risk of aseptic revision (cumulative incidence at 1 year after operation, 3.0% vs 1.3%;\nabsolute difference, 1.7% [95% CI, 1.1%-2.2%]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.77 [95% CI, 1.43-2.19]; P < .001). Of the 6 prespecified secondary end points, none showed a statistically significant difference between\ngroups, including in-hospital mortality (1.7% for uncemented fixation vs 2.0% for cemented fixation; HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.73-1.21]; P = .61) and overall mortality (cumulative incidence at 1 year after\noperation: 20.0% for uncemented fixation vs 22.8% for cemented fixation; HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.90-1.01]; P = .08). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with hip fracture treated with hemiarthroplasty in\na large US integrated health care system, uncemented fixation, compared with cemented fixation, was associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of aseptic revision. These findings suggest that US surgeons\nshould consider cemented fixation in the hemiarthroplasty treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in the absence of contraindications.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32181848", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32181847", "Title": "Association Between Surgical Approach and Major Surgical Complications in Patients Undergoing Total Hip Arthroplasty.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/27 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 17", "Abstract": "Importance: Controversy exists about the preferred surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty (THA). Objective: To determine whether an anterior approach is associated with lower risk of complications than either a\nlateral or posterior approach. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based retrospective cohort study of all adults in Ontario, Canada, who had undergone primary THA for osteoarthritis between April 1, 2015, and\nMarch 31, 2018. All patients were followed up over a 1-year period (study end date, March 31, 2019). Exposures: Surgical approach (anterior vs lateral/posterior) for THA. Main Outcomes and Measures:\nMajor surgical complications within 1 year (composite of deep infection requiring surgery, dislocation requiring closed or open reduction, or revision surgery). Outcomes were compared among propensity-score matched groups using Cox\nproportional hazards regression. Results: Of the 30098 patients (mean [SD] age, 67 years [10.7 years]; 16079 women [53.4%]) who underwent THA, 2995 (10%) underwent the anterior approach; 21248 (70%), the\nlateral approach; and 5855 (20%) the posterior approach performed at 1 of 73 hospitals by 1 of 298 surgeons. All patients were followed up for 1 year. Compared with those\nundergoing the lateral or posterior approach, patients undergoing an anterior approach were younger (mean age, 65 vs 67 years; standardized difference, 0.17); had lower rates of morbid obesity (4.8% vs\n7.6%; standardized difference, 0.12), diabetes (14.2% vs 19.9%; standardized difference, 0.15), and hypertension (53.4% vs 62.9%; standardized difference, 0.19); and were treated by higher-volume surgeons (median range, 111 procedures; interquartile\nrange, 69-172 vs 77 procedures, interquartile range, 50-119 in the prior year; standardized difference, 0.55). Compared with 2993 propensity-score matched patients undergoing a lateral or posterior approach, the 2993 matched\npatients undergoing anterior approaches had a significantly greater risk of a major surgical complication (61 patients [2%] vs 29 patients [1%]; absolute risk difference, 1.07%; 95% CI, 0.46%-1.69%; hazard ratio,\n2.07; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.88). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, an anterior surgical approach compared with a posterior or lateral surgical approach was associated with\na small but statistically significant increased risk of major surgical complications.

installation of methyl groups, especially adjacent (alpha) to heteroatoms, has been shown to drastically increase the potency of bioactive molecules(1-3). Current methylation\nmethods display limited scope and have not been demonstrated in complex settings(1). Here we report a regio- and chemoselective oxidative C(sp(3))-H methylation method compatible with late-stage functionalization of drug scaffolds\nand natural products. This combines a highly site- and chemoselective C-H hydroxylation with a mild, functional-group-tolerant methylation. Using a small-molecule manganese catalyst Mn(CF3PDP) at low loading (substrate/catalyst = 200) afforded\ntargeted C-H hydroxylation on heterocyclic cores, while preserving electron-neutral and electron-rich aryls. Fluorine- or Lewis-acid-assisted formation of reactive iminium or oxonium intermediates enabled the use of a mildly nucleophilic organoaluminum\nmethylating reagent that preserves other electrophilic functionalities on the substrate. The late-stage C(sp(3))-H methylation is demonstrated on 41 substrates housing 16 different medicinally important cores that include electron-rich aryls, heterocycles,\ncarbonyls and amines. Eighteen pharmacologically relevant molecules with competing sites-including drugs (for example tedizolid) and natural products-are methylated site-selectively at the most electron rich, least sterically hindered position. Syntheses of\ntwo magic methyl substrates, an RORc inverse agonist and an S1P1 antagonist, are demonstrated for the first time via late-stage methylation from the drug or its advanced precursor. Additionally, an\nunprecedented remote methylation of the B-ring carbocycle of an abiraterone analog is shown. The ability to methylate such complex molecules at late stages will reduce synthetic effort and thereby expedite\nbroader exploration of the magic methyl effect in pursuit of novel small molecule therapeutics and chemical probes.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179876", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32179859", "Title": "Exposed: cells' sugary secrets.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179859", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32179575", "Title": "Ethnic minority patients receive worse mental healthcare than white patients, review finds.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179575", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32179567", "Title": "Covid-19: outbreak could last until spring 2021 and see 7.9 million hospitalised in the UK.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179567", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32179555", "Title": "Primary care networks: LMC leaders vote to reject revised agreement on directed enhanced services.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179555", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32179548", "Title": "Mobile messaging with patients.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/20 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179548", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32179534", "Title": "Redesigning safety regulation in the NHS.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/20 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179534", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32179533", "Title": "Covid-19: medical schools are urged to fast-track final year students.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179533", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32179518", "Title": "How do I tell a colleague they have made a mistake?", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179518", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32179508", "Title": "Covid-19: junior doctor calls on colleagues to gather supplies for staff working long hours.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 16", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179508", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32178778", "Title": "COPD exacerbations: finally, a more than ACCEPTable risk score.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

We developed and validated a generalisable model to predict individualised rate and severity\nof COPD exacerbations. METHODS: In this risk modelling study, we pooled data from three COPD trials on patients with a history of exacerbations. We developed a mixed-effect model to predict\nexacerbations over 1 year. Severe exacerbations were those requiring inpatient care. Predictors were history of exacerbations, age, sex, body-mass index, smoking status, domiciliary oxygen therapy, lung function, symptom burden, and\ncurrent medication use. Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE), a multicentre cohort study, was used for external validation. RESULTS: The development dataset included 2380 patients, 1373\n(58%) of whom were men. Mean age was 64.7 years (SD 8.8). Mean exacerbation rate was 1.42 events per year and 0.29 events per year were severe. When validated against\nall patients with COPD in ECLIPSE (mean exacerbation rate was 1.20 events per year, 0.27 events per year were severe), the area-under-curve (AUC) was 0.81 (95% CI 0.79-0.83) for at\nleast two exacerbations and 0.77 (95% CI 0.74-0.80) for at least one severe exacerbation. Predicted exacerbation and observed exacerbation rates were similar (1.31 events per year for all exacerbations and\n0.25 events per year for severe exacerbations vs 1.20 events per year and 0.27 events per year). In ECLIPSE, in patients with previous exacerbation history (mean exacerbation rate was 1.82\nevents per year, 0.40 events per year were severe), AUC was 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.76) for two or more exacerbations and 0.74 (95% CI 0.70-0.78) for at least one severe\nexacerbation. Calibration was accurate for severe exacerbations (predicted 0.37 events per year vs observed 0.40 events per year) and all exacerbations (predicted 1.80 events per year vs observed 1.82 events\nper year).

Prospective head-to-head comparisons of their diagnostic accuracy in real-world settings are necessary to assess their clinical\nuse. We aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of candidate transcriptional signatures identified by systematic review, in a setting with a high burden of tuberculosis and HIV. METHODS: We did\na prospective observational study nested within a diagnostic accuracy study of sputum Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) tests for pulmonary tuberculosis. We recruited consecutive symptomatic adults aged\n18 years or older self-presenting to a tuberculosis clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants provided blood for RNA sequencing, and sputum samples for liquid culture and molecular testing using\nXpert and Ultra. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of candidate blood transcriptional signatures for active tuberculosis (including those intended to distinguish active tuberculosis from other diseases) identified by systematic review,\ncompared with culture or Xpert MTB/RIF positivity as the standard reference. In our primary analysis, patients with tuberculosis were defined as those with either a positive liquid culture or Xpert\nresult. Patients with missing blood RNA or sputum results were excluded. Our primary objective was to benchmark the diagnostic accuracy of candidate transcriptional signatures against the WHO target product profile\n(TPP) for a tuberculosis triage test. FINDINGS: Between Feb 12, 2016, and July 18, 2017, we obtained paired sputum and RNA sequencing data from 181 participants, 54 (30%) of whom\nhad confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Of 27 eligible signatures identified by systematic review, four achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy with similar area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (Sweeney3: 90.6% [95%\nCI 85.6-95.6]; Kaforou25: 86.9% [80.9-92.9]; Roe3: 86.9% [80.3-93.5]; and BATF2: 86.8% [80.6-93.1]), independent of age, sex, HIV status, previous tuberculosis, or sputum smear result. At test thresholds that gave 70%\nspecificity (the minimum WHO TPP specificity for a triage test), these four signatures achieved sensitivities between 83.3% (95% CI 71.3-91.0) and 90.7% (80.1-96.0). No signature met the optimum criteria, of\n95% sensitivity and 80% specificity proposed by WHO for a triage test, or the minimum criteria (of 65% sensitivity and 98% specificity) for a confirmatory test, but all four correctly\nidentified Ultra-positive, culture-negative patients. INTERPRETATION: Selected blood transcriptional signatures met the minimum WHO benchmarks for a tuberculosis triage test but not for a confirmatory test. Further development of the signatures\nis warranted to investigate their possible effects on clinical and health economic outcomes as part of a triage strategy, or when used as add-on confirmatory test in conjunction with the\nhighly sensitive Ultra test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA.

These estimates were analysed with DisMod-MR, a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression tool\nthat incorporates predictive covariates and adjustments for differences in study design in a geographical cascade of models. Fitted values for broader geographical units inform prior distributions for finer geographical units.\nPrevalence was estimated for 195 countries and territories. Reports of the frequency and severity of symptoms among individuals with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were used to estimate the prevalence of cases\nwith no, mild to moderate, or severe to very severe symptoms at a given time; these estimates were multiplied by disability weights to estimate years lived with disability (YLD). FINDINGS:\nData to estimate gastro-oesophageal reflux disease burden were scant, totalling 144 location-years (unique measurements from a year and location, regardless of whether a study reported them alongside measurements for other\nlocations or years) of prevalence data. These came from six (86%) of seven GBD super-regions, 11 (52%) of 21 GBD regions, and 39 (20%) of 195 countries and territories. Mean\nestimates of age-standardised prevalence for all locations in 2017 ranged from 4408 cases per 100 000 population to 14 035 cases per 100 000 population. Age-standardised prevalence was highest (>11\n000 cases per 100 000 population) in the USA, Italy, Greece, New Zealand, and several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, north Africa and the Middle East, and eastern\nEurope; it was lowest (<7000 cases per 100 000 population) in the high-income Asia Pacific, east Asia, Iceland, France, Denmark, and Switzerland. Global prevalence peaked at ages 75-79 years, at\n18 820 (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 13 770-24 000) cases per 100 000 population. Global age-standardised prevalence was stable between 1990 and 2017 (8791 [95% UI 7772-9834] cases per\n100 000 population in 1990 and 8819 [7781-9863] cases per 100 000 population in 2017, percentage change 0.3% [-0.3 to 0.9]), but all-age prevalence increased by 18.1% (15.6-20.4) between 1990\nand 2017, from 7859 (6905-8851) cases per 100 000 population in 1990 to 9283 (8189-10 400) cases per 100 000 population in 2017. YLDs increased by 67.1% (95% UI 63.5-70.3)\nbetween 1990 and 2017, from 3.60 million (1.93-6.12) in 1990 to 6.01 million (3.22-10.19) in 2017. INTERPRETATION: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is common worldwide, although less so in much of eastern\nAsia. The stability of our global age-standardised prevalence estimates over time suggests that the epidemiology of the disease has not changed, but the estimates of all-age prevalence and YLDs, which\nincreased between 1990 and 2017, suggest that the burden of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is nonetheless increasing as a result of ageing and population growth.

METHODS: This phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was done at\n118 sites in 13 countries across Asia, Europe, and North America. We enrolled biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis (at least five swollen joints, at least five tender joints, and\nC-reactive protein >/=0.6 mg/dL) despite standard therapies.

Infectious diseases", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 13", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The clinical and epidemiological significance of HIV-associated Mycobacterium tuberculosis bloodstream infection (BSI) is incompletely understood. We hypothesised that M tuberculosis BSI prevalence has been underestimated, that it independently predicts\ndeath, and that sputum Xpert MTB/RIF has suboptimal diagnostic yield for M tuberculosis BSI. METHODS: We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies performing routine\nmycobacterial blood culture in a prospectively defined patient population of people with HIV aged 13 years or older. Studies were identified through searching PubMed and Scopus up to Nov 10,\n2018, without language or date restrictions and through manual review of reference lists. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with an adapted QUADAS-2 framework. IPD were requested\nfor all identified studies and subject to harmonised inclusion criteria: age 13 years or older, HIV positivity, available CD4 cell count, a valid mycobacterial blood culture result (excluding patients with\nmissing data from lost or contaminated blood cultures), and meeting WHO definitions for suspected tuberculosis (presence of screening symptom). Predicted probabilities of M tuberculosis BSI from mixed-effects modelling were used\nto estimate prevalence. Estimates of diagnostic yield of sputum testing with Xpert (or culture if Xpert was unavailable) and of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing for M tuberculosis BSI were obtained\nby two-level random-effect meta-analysis. Estimates of mortality associated with M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by mixed-effect Cox proportional-hazard modelling and of effect of treatment delay on mortality by propensity-score analysis.\nThis study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016050022. FINDINGS: We identified 23 datasets for inclusion (20 published and three unpublished at time of search) and obtained IPD from 20, representing\n96.2% of eligible IPD. Risk of bias for the included studies was assessed to be generally low except for on the patient selection domain, which was moderate in most studies.\n5751 patients met harmonised IPD-level inclusion criteria. Technical factors such as number of blood cultures done, timing of blood cultures relative to blood sampling, and patient factors such as inpatient\nsetting and CD4 cell count, explained significant heterogeneity between primary studies. The predicted probability of M tuberculosis BSI in hospital inpatients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, WHO danger signs, and a CD4\ncount of 76 cells per muL (the median for the cohort) was 45% (95% CI 38-52). The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with M tuberculosis BSI was 77% (95%\nCI 63-87), increasing to 89% (80-94) when combined with urine LAM testing. Presence of M tuberculosis BSI compared with its absence in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis increased risk of death\nbefore 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio 2.48, 95% CI 2.05-3.08) but not after 30 days (1.25, 0.84-2.49). In a propensity-score matched cohort of participants with HIV-associated tuberculosis (n=630), mortality increased\nin patients with M tuberculosis BSI who had a delay in anti-tuberculosis treatment of longer than 4 days compared with those who had no delay (odds ratio 3.15, 95% CI\n1.16-8.84). INTERPRETATION: In critically ill adults with HIV-tuberculosis, M tuberculosis BSI is a frequent manifestation of tuberculosis and predicts mortality within 30 days. Improved diagnostic yield in patients with M\ntuberculosis BSI could be achieved through combined use of sputum Xpert and urine LAM. Anti-tuberculosis treatment delay might increase the risk of mortality in these patients.

We examined correlates of suicidality in a US population-based sample of children participating in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD)\nstudy. The ABCD study aims to examine trajectories of mental health from childhood to adulthood and collects information on multiple domains, including mental and physical wellbeing, brain imaging, behavioural and\ncognitive characteristics, and social and family environment. We sought to identify and rank risk and protective factors for childhood suicidal thoughts and behaviours across these multiple domains and evaluate their\nassociation with self-agreement and caregiver agreement in reporting suicidality. METHODS: The ABCD sample comprises a cohort of 11 875 children aged 9-10 years. The sociodemographic factors on which the sample\nwas recruited were age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, and urbanicity. Participants were enrolled at 22 sites, the catchment area of which encompassed over 20% of the entire US population in\nthis age group. Multistage sampling was used to ensure both local randomisation and representativeness of sociodemographic variation of the ABCD sample. The data used in this study were accessed from\nthe ABCD Study Curated Annual Release 2.0. Suicidal thoughts and behaviours (suicidality) in each child were evaluated through independent child and caregiver reports based on the computerized Kiddie Schedule for\nAffective Disorders and Schizophrenia for DSM-5 (KSADS-5). We used bootstrapped logistic regression to quantify the association between suicidal ideation and behaviours, with measures of mental and physical wellbeing, behaviour, cognition,\nand social and family environment in participants from the ABCD study. FINDINGS: Our study sample comprised 7994 unrelated children (mean age 9.9 years [SD 0.5]; 4234 [53%] male participants) with\ncomplete data on child-reported and caregiver-reported suicidal ideas and behaviours. Overall, 673 (8.4%) children reported any past or current suicidal ideation, 75 (0.9%) had any past or current suicidal plans,\nand 107 (1.3%) had any past or current suicidal attempts. According to caregivers, 650 (8.1%) of the children reported any past or current suicidal ideation, 46 (0.6%) reported any past\nor current suicidal plans, and 39 (0.5%) reported past or current suicidal attempts. However, inter-informant agreement was low (Cohen's kappa range 0.0-0.2). Regardless of informant, child psychopathology (odds ratio [OR]\n1.7-4.8, 95% CI 1.5-7.4) and child-reported family conflict (OR 1.4-1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.5) were the most robust risk factors for suicidality. The risk of child-reported suicidality increased with higher weekend\nscreen use time (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.7) and reduced with greater parental supervision and positive school involvement (for both OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9). Additionally, caregiver-reported suicidality was positively\nassociated with caregiver educational level (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5) and male sex in children (1.5, 1.1-2.0), and inversely associated with the number of household cohabitants (0.8, 0.7-1.0). INTERPRETATION: We\nidentified risk and protective factors that show robust and generalisable associations with childhood suicidality. These factors provide actionable targets for optimising prevention and intervention strategies, support the need to identify\nand treat psychopathology in school-age children, and underscore the importance of school and family interventions for childhood suicidality.

The primary endpoint was time to locoregional progression from randomisation with the objective to\ntest non-inferiority of (18)F-FDG PET-based planning with a prespecified hazard ratio (HR) margin of 1.25. The per-protocol set was included in the primary analysis. The safety set included all patients\nreceiving any study-specific treatment. Patients and study staff were not masked to treatment assignment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00697333. FINDINGS: From May 13, 2009, to Dec 5, 2016,\n205 of 311 recruited patients were randomly assigned to the conventional target group (n=99) or the (18)F-FDG PET-based target group (n=106; the intention-to-treat set), and 172 patients were treated per\nprotocol (84 patients in the conventional target group and 88 in the (18)F-FDG PET-based target group). At a median follow-up of 29 months (IQR 9-54), the risk of locoregional progression\nin the (18)F-FDG PET-based target group was non-inferior to, and in fact lower than, that in the conventional target group in the per-protocol set (14% [95% CI 5-21] vs 29%\n[17-38] at 1 year; HR 0.57 [95% CI 0.30-1.06]). The risk of locoregional progression in the (18)F-FDG PET-based target group was also non-inferior to that in the conventional target group\nin the intention-to-treat set (17% [95% CI 9-24] vs 30% [20-39] at 1 year; HR 0.64 [95% CI 0.37-1.10]). The most common acute grade 3 or worse toxicity was oesophagitis\nor dysphagia (16 [16%] of 99 patients in the conventional target group vs 17 [16%] of 105 patients in the (18)F-FDG PET-based target group); the most common late toxicities were\nlung-related (12 [12%] vs 11 [10%]). 20 deaths potentially related to study treatment were reported (seven vs 13). INTERPRETATION: (18)F-FDG PET-based planning could potentially improve local control and does not\nseem to increase toxicity in patients with chemoradiotherapy-treated locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Imaging-based target volume reduction in this setting is, therefore, feasible, and could potentially be considered standard of\ncare. The procedures established might also support imaging-based target volume reduction concepts for other tumours.

In\nthe primary analysis and subsequent reports, progression-free and overall survival were significantly improved in the pertuzumab group compared with the placebo group. Here, we report the end-of-study analysis of CLEOPATRA.\nMETHODS: This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that was done at 204 centres in 25 countries. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had HER2-positive, metastatic breast\ncancer, had not received previous chemotherapy or biological treatment for their metastatic disease, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. All study drugs were\ngiven intravenously, every 3 weeks. Patients were assigned to receive either pertuzumab or placebo at a loading dose of 840 mg, and 420 mg thereafter; plus trastuzumab at 8 mg/kg\nloading dose and 6 mg/kg thereafter; and docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2), escalating to 100 mg/m(2) if tolerated. Pertuzumab or placebo and trastuzumab were given until disease progression; docetaxel was given\nfor six cycles, or longer at the investigators' discretion. Randomisation (1:1) was done by use of an interactive voice-response system and was stratified by geographical region (Asia, Europe, North America,\nor South America) and previous treatment (previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs none). The primary endpoint was independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival, which has been reported previously. Since the confirmatory\noverall survival analysis had also occurred before this prespecified end-of-study analysis, analyses presented here are descriptive. Overall survival analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population with crossover patients analysed in\nthe placebo group; analyses were not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and are likely to be conservative. Safety analyses were based on treatment received; crossover patients were counted\nin the placebo group up to the day before first pertuzumab dose. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00567190. FINDINGS: Between Feb 12, 2008, and July 7, 2010, 1196\npatients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 808 were enrolled and randomly assigned. 402 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, and 406 patients were assigned to\nreceive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus placebo. Clinical cutoff for this analysis was Nov 23, 2018. Between July 2012 and clinical cutoff, 50 patients crossed from the placebo to the pertuzumab\ngroup. Median follow-up was 99.9 months in the pertuzumab group (IQR 92.9-106.4) and 98.7 months (90.9-105.7) in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 57.1 months (95% CI 50-72) in\nthe pertuzumab group and 40.8 months (36-48) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.82); 8-year landmark overall survival rates were 37% (95% CI 31-42) in the pertuzumab\ngroup and 23% (19-28) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (200 [49%] of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group, 183 [46%] of 396\npatients in the placebo group). Five (1%) of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group and six (2%) of 396 patients in the placebo group had treatment-related deaths. One new serious\nadverse event suggestive of congestive heart failure (pertuzumab group) and one new symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (post-crossover) occurred since the previous analysis. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis shows that the previously\nobserved improvements in overall survival with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel versus placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained after a median of more than 8 years of follow-up. The long-term safety\nand cardiac safety profiles of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained in the overall safety population and within crossover patients. HER2-targeted therapy has changed the natural history of HER2-positive metastatic\nbreast cancer, with the dual blockade of pertuzumab and trastuzumab, with docetaxel, demonstrating an 8-year landmark overall survival rate of 37%.

It is most prevalent in western and central Africa and Australia.\nStandard antimicrobial treatment with oral rifampicin 10 mg/kg plus intramuscular streptomycin 15 mg/kg once daily for 8 weeks (RS8) is highly effective, but streptomycin injections are painful and potentially harmful.\nWe aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of fully oral rifampicin 10 mg/kg plus clarithromycin 15 mg/kg extended release once daily for 8 weeks (RC8) with that of RS8\nfor treatment of early Buruli ulcer lesions. METHODS: We did an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised (1:1 with blocks of six), multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial comparing fully oral RC8 with RS8\nin patients with early, limited Buruli ulcer lesions. There were four trial sites in hospitals in Ghana (Agogo, Tepa, Nkawie, Dunkwa) and one in Benin (Pobe). Participants were included if\nthey were aged 5 years or older and had typical Buruli ulcer with no more than one lesion (caterories I and II) no larger than 10 cm in diameter. The\ntrial was open label, and neither the investigators who took measurements of the lesions nor the attending doctors were masked to treatment assignment. The primary clinical endpoint was lesion healing\n(ie, full epithelialisation or stable scar) without recurrence at 52 weeks after start of antimicrobial therapy. The primary endpoint and safety were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A sample size\nof 332 participants was calculated to detect inferiority of RC8 by a margin of 12%. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01659437. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 31,\n2017, participants were recruited to the trial. We stopped recruitment after 310 participants. Median age of participants was 14 years (IQR 10-29) and 153 (52%) were female. 297 patients had\nPCR-confirmed Buruli ulcer; 151 (51%) were assigned to RS8 treatment, and 146 (49%) received oral RC8 treatment. In the RS8 group, lesions healed in 144 (95%, 95% CI 91 to\n98) of 151 patients, whereas lesions healed in 140 (96%, 91 to 99) of 146 patients in the RC8 group. The difference in proportion, -0.5% (-5.2 to 4.2), was not\nsignificantly greater than zero (p=0.59), showing that RC8 treatment is non-inferior to RS8 treatment for lesion healing at 52 weeks. Treatment-related adverse events were recorded in 20 (13%) patients receiving\nRS8 and in nine (7%) patients receiving RC8. Most adverse events were grade 1-2, but one (1%) patient receiving RS8 developed serious ototoxicity and ended treatment after 6 weeks. No\npatients needed surgical resection. Four patients (two in each study group) had skin grafts. INTERPRETATION: Fully oral RC8 regimen was non-inferior to RS8 for treatment of early, limited Buruli ulcer\nand was associated with fewer adverse events. Therefore, we propose that fully oral RC8 should be the preferred therapy for early, limited lesions of Buruli ulcer.

Disturbed attitudes towards weight, body shape, and eating play a key role\nin the origin and maintenance of eating disorders. Eating disorders have been increasing over the past 50 years and changes in the food environment have been implicated. All health-care providers\nshould routinely enquire about eating habits as a component of overall health assessment. Six main feeding and eating disorders are now recognised in diagnostic systems: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge\neating disorder, avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, pica, and rumination disorder. The presentation form of eating disorders might vary for men versus women, for example. As eating disorders are under-researched, there\nis a great deal of uncertainty as to their pathophysiology, treatment, and management.

Early initiation of dopaminergic therapies does not convey disease-modifying effects but does reduce disability. Concerns about\nthe development of motor complications arising from the early initiation of levodopa, which led to misconceived levodopa-sparing strategies, have been largely mitigated by the outcomes of the PD MED and\nLevodopa in Early Parkinson's Disease (LEAP) studies. The LEAP study also showed the potential for early improvement in quality of life, even when disability is negligible. Until more effective methods\nof providing stable dopamine concentrations are developed, current evidence supports the use of levodopa as initial symptomatic treatment in most patients with Parkinson's disease, starting with low doses and titrating\nto therapeutic threshold. Monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists can be reserved as potential adjunct treatments later in the disease course.

Triple artemisinin-based combination therapies (TACTs), which combine existing co-formulated ACTs with a second partner\ndrug that is slowly eliminated, might provide effective treatment and delay emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised trial, we recruited patients with uncomplicated P falciparum\nmalaria at 18 hospitals and health clinics in eight countries. Eligible patients were aged 2-65 years, with acute, uncomplicated P falciparum malaria alone or mixed with non-falciparum species, and a\ntemperature of 37.5 degrees C or higher, or a history of fever in the past 24 h. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two treatments using block randomisation,\ndepending on their location: in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Myanmar patients were assigned to either dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine; at three sites in Cambodia they were assigned to either\nartesunate-mefloquine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine; and in Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo they were assigned to either artemether-lumefantrine or artemether-lumefantrine plus amodiaquine. All drugs\nwere administered orally and doses varied by drug combination and site. Patients were followed-up weekly for 42 days. The primary endpoint was efficacy, defined by 42-day PCR-corrected adequate clinical and\nparasitological response. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. A detailed assessment of safety and tolerability of the study drugs was done in all patients randomly assigned to treatment. This\nstudy is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02453308, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Aug 7, 2015, and Feb 8, 2018, 1100 patients were given either dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (183 [17%]), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine (269\n[25%]), artesunate-mefloquine (73 [7%]), artemether-lumefantrine (289 [26%]), or artemether-lumefantrine plus amodiaquine (286 [26%]). The median age was 23 years (IQR 13 to 34) and 854 (78%) of 1100 patients were\nmale. In Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam the 42-day PCR-corrected efficacy after dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine was 98% (149 of 152; 95% CI 94 to 100) and after dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was 48% (67\nof 141; 95% CI 39 to 56; risk difference 51%, 95% CI 42 to 59; p<0.0001). Efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine in the three sites in Myanmar was 91% (42\nof 46; 95% CI 79 to 98) versus 100% (42 of 42; 95% CI 92 to 100) after dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (risk difference 9%, 95% CI 1 to 17; p=0.12). The 42-day\nPCR corrected efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine (96% [68 of 71; 95% CI 88 to 99]) was non-inferior to that of artesunate-mefloquine (95% [69 of 73; 95% CI 87 to\n99]) in three sites in Cambodia (risk difference 1%; 95% CI -6 to 8; p=1.00). The overall 42-day PCR-corrected efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine plus amodiaquine (98% [281 of 286; 95% CI\n97 to 99]) was similar to that of artemether-lumefantrine (97% [279 of 289; 95% CI 94 to 98]; risk difference 2%, 95% CI -1 to 4; p=0.30). Both TACTs were\nwell tolerated, although early vomiting (within 1 h) was more frequent after dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine (30 [3.8%] of 794) than after dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (eight [1.5%] of 543; p=0.012). Vomiting after artemether-lumefantrine\nplus amodiaquine (22 [1.3%] of 1703) and artemether-lumefantrine (11 [0.6%] of 1721) was infrequent. Adding amodiaquine to artemether-lumefantrine extended the electrocardiogram corrected QT interval (mean increase at 52 h compared\nwith baseline of 8.8 ms [SD 18.6] vs 0.9 ms [16.1]; p<0.01) but adding mefloquine to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine did not (mean increase of 22.1 ms [SD 19.2] for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine vs 20.8\nms [SD 17.8] for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine; p=0.50). INTERPRETATION: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus mefloquine and artemether-lumefantrine plus amodiaquine TACTs are efficacious, well tolerated, and safe treatments of uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, including\nin areas with artemisinin and ACT partner-drug resistance.

We aimed to ascertain the safety and activity of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide,\ndoxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) with high-dose methotrexate and intrathecal chemotherapy as CNS-oriented therapy for patients with previously untreated IVLBCL. METHODS: PRIMEUR-IVL is a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial at 22\nhospitals in Japan. Eligible patients had untreated histologically confirmed IVLBCL, were aged 20-79 years, had an Eastern Cooperative Group performance status of 0-3, and had no apparent CNS involvement at\ndiagnosis. Patients received three cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab 375 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 [except cycle one, which was on day 8]; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2), and vincristine\n1.4 mg/m(2) [maximum 2.0 mg] intravenously on day 1 of cycle one and day 2 of cycles two and three; and prednisolone 100 mg/day orally on days 1-5 of cycle\none and days 2-6 of cycles two and three) followed by two cycles of rituximab with high-dose methotrexate (3.5 g/m(2) intravenously on day 2 of cycles four and five) every\n2 weeks and three additional cycles of R-CHOP. Intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate 15 mg, cytarabine 40 mg, and prednisolone 10 mg) was administered four times during the R-CHOP phase. The primary\nendpoint was 2-year progression-free survival. Efficacy analyses were done in all enrolled patients; safety analyses were done in all enrolled and treated patients. The trial is registered in the UMIN\nClinical Trials Registry (UMIN000005707) and the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs041180165); the trial is ongoing for long-term follow-up. FINDINGS: Between June 16, 2011, and July 21, 2016, 38 patients\nwere enrolled, of whom 37 were eligible; one patient was excluded because of a history of testicular lymphoma. Median follow-up was 3.9 years (IQR 2.5-5.5). 2-year progression-free survival was 76%\n(95% CI 58-87). The most frequent adverse events of grade 3-4 were neutropenia and leucocytopenia, which were reported in all 38 (100%) patients. Serious adverse events were hypokalaemia, febrile neutropenia\nwith hypotension, hypertension, and intracerebral haemorrhage (reported in one [3%] patient each). No treatment-related deaths occurred during protocol treatment. INTERPRETATION: R-CHOP combined with rituximab and high-dose methotrexate plus intrathecal chemotherapy\nis a safe and active treatment for patients with IVLBCL without apparent CNS involvement at diagnosis, and this regimen warrants future investigation.

The BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, has shown promising activity in combination with hypomethylating agents and low-dose cytarabine in\nolder adults for whom chemotherapy is not suitable with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia. We aimed to determine the safety and explore the activity of venetoclax in combination with standard\nand high-dose chemotherapy in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: We did a phase 1, dose-escalation study at three research hospitals in the USA. Eligible patients\nwere aged 2-22 years with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia or acute leukaemia of ambiguous lineage with adequate organ function and performance status. During dose escalation, participants received venetoclax\norally once per day in continuous 28-day cycles at either 240 mg/m(2) or 360 mg/m(2), in combination with cytarabine received intravenously every 12 h at either 100 mg/m(2) for 20\ndoses or 1000 mg/m(2) for eight doses, with or without intravenous idarubicin (12 mg/m(2)) as a single dose, using a rolling-6 accrual strategy. The primary endpoint was the recommended phase\n2 dose of venetoclax plus chemotherapy and the secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose who achieved complete remission or complete remission with\nincomplete haematological recovery. Analyses were done on patients who received combination therapy. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03194932) and is now enrolling to address secondary and exploratory objectives. FINDINGS:\nBetween July 1, 2017, and July 2, 2019, 38 patients were enrolled (aged 3-22 years; median 10 [IQR 7-13]), 36 of whom received combination therapy with dose escalation, with a\nmedian follow-up of 7.1 months (IQR 5.1-11.2). The recommended phase 2 dose of venetoclax was found to be 360 mg/m(2) (maximum 600 mg) combined with cytarabine (1000 mg/m(2) per dose\nfor eight doses), with or without idarubicin (12 mg/m(2) as a single dose). Overall responses were observed in 24 (69%) of the 35 patients who were evaluable after cycle 1.\nAmong the 20 patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, 14 (70%, 95% CI 46-88) showed complete response with or without complete haematological recovery, and two (10%) showed partial\nresponse. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (22 [66%]), bloodstream infections (six [16%]), and invasive fungal infections (six [16%]). Treatment-related death occurred in one patient due\nto colitis and sepsis.

In this prespecified subgroup analysis of a previously published open-label\nclinical trial, we aimed to assess associations between blood eosinophil counts and FeNO with outcomes and response to asthma treatment. METHODS: In the previously reported 52-week, open-label, randomised controlled trial,\npeople with mild asthma receiving only beta agonist reliever inhalers were enrolled at one of 16 clinical trials units in New Zealand, the UK, Italy, or Australia. Eligible participants were\nrandomly assigned (1:1:1, stratified by country), to receive inhalers to take as-needed salbutamol (two inhalations of 100 mug in a pressurised metered dose inhaler), maintenance budesonide (200 mug twice per\nday by inhaler) plus as-needed salbutamol (two inhalations of 100 mug), or as-needed budesonide-formoterol (one inhalation of 200 mug budesonide and 6mug formoterol by inhaler). The primary outcome was the\nannual rates of asthma exacerbations per patient, and in this prespecified subgroup analysis, we assessed whether annual exacerbation rates in each treatment group were significantly different depending on levels of\nblood eosinophil count, FeNO, or a composite score of both. Analyses were done for patients with available biomarker measurements The study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials\nRegistry, number ACTRN12615000999538. FINDINGS: 675 participants were enrolled between March 17, 2016, and Aug 29, 2017, of whom 656 had results for blood eosinophil analysis and 668 had results for\nFeNO. Of the patients who received as-needed salbutamol, the proportion of patients having a severe exacerbation increased progressively with increasing blood eosinophil count (two [4%] of 49 participants with <0.15\nx 10(9)/L, six [6%] of 93 with 0.15 to <0.3 x 10(9)/L, and 15 [19%] of 77 with >/=0.3 x 10(9)/L; p=0.014). There were no significant interactions between blood eosinophil\ncount or FeNO level and the effect of as-needed budesonide-formoterol compared with as-needed salbutamol for either exacerbations or severe exacerbations. However, there were significant interactions between blood eosinophil count subgroups\nand the effect of maintenance budesonide plus as-needed salbutamol compared with as-needed salbutamol, both for exacerbations (p=0.0006) and severe exacerbations (p=0.0007). Maintenance budesonide plus as-needed salbutamol was more effective than\nas-needed salbutamol in patients with blood eosinophil counts of 0.3 x 10(9)/L or more, both for exacerbations (rate ratio 0.13 [95% CI 0.05-0.33]) and severe exacerbations (risk odds ratio 0.11\n[0.03-0.45]). This difference was not seen for blood eosinophil counts of less than 0.15 x 10(9)/L (1.15 [0.51-1.28] for exacerbations and 5.72 [0.97-33.60] for severe exacerbations). There was no consistent\ninteraction between treatment response and FeNO or the composite score. INTERPRETATION: In patients with mild asthma, the effects of as-needed budesonide-formoterol on exacerbations are independent of biomarker profile, whereas the\nbenefits of maintenance inhaled budesonide are greater in patients with high blood eosinophil counts than in patients with low counts.

The primary analysis was assessed in the safety population, which included patients who received at least\none dose of any study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01421186. FINDINGS: Between Aug 24, 2011, and Aug 1, 2017, 91 patients were treated, 35 with MOR202 monotherapy,\nand 56 with MOR202 combination regimens (18 in the MOR202 with dexamethasone group, 21 in the MOR202 with dexamethasone plus pomalidomide group, and 17 in the MOR202 with dexamethasone plus\nlenalidomide group). MOR202 intravenous infusions were safely administered within 30 min. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 14 (40%) of 35 patients receiving MOR202 monotherapy without steroids, and in four (7%) of\n56 patients receiving MOR202 combination treatment. MOR202 maximum tolerated dose was not reached and the recommended regimens were MOR202 administered as an intravenous infusion for 30 min at doses up\nto 16 mg/kg with dexamethasone (40 mg), or in combination with dexamethasone plus lenalidomide (25 mg) or pomalidomide (4 mg). 35 (38%) of 91 patients developed lymphopenia, 30 (33%) developed\nneutropenia, and 27 (30%) developed leukopenia; these were the most common grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported in 51 (56%) of 91 patients. None\nof the deaths were associated with MOR202. One pomalidomide-associated death occurred in the MOR202 with dexamethasone plus pomalidomide group. No anti-MOR202 antibodies were detected in patients. INTERPRETATION: MOR202 is safe\nand its clinical activity in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma is promising. Further clinical investigations of combinations with an immunomodulatory drug and dexamethasone are recommended.

Although the exact cause and pathogenesis of this disease is unclear, research has led to a better understanding of the\ncondition and to identification of new targets for therapy, which in turn has encouraged the development of new therapies. As well as biologic therapies, which have changed the way inflammatory\nbowel disease is managed, small molecules have been developed for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. These small molecule treatments are orally administered and are likely to bring a substantial shift\nin the way this chronic disease is treated. Oral therapies offer many advantages over infusion therapies, such as ease of use, increased acceptability by patients, and reduction of cost. This\nReview focuses not only on oral therapies that have been approved for use in ulcerative colitis, but also on those that are in development, providing a comprehensive overview for clinicians\nof available oral therapies and drugs that are likely to become available.

HIV", "Creation Date": "2020/03/15 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 9", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The London patient (participant 36 in the IciStem cohort) underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation with cells that did not express CCR5 (CCR5Delta32/Delta32); remission was reported at 18 months after analytical\ntreatment interruption (ATI). Here, we present longer term data for this patient (up to 30 months after ATI), including sampling from diverse HIV-1 reservoir sites. METHODS: We used ultrasensitive viral\nload assays of plasma, semen, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples to detect HIV-1 RNA. In gut biopsy samples and lymph-node tissue, cell-copy number and total HIV-1 DNA levels were quantified\nin multiple replicates, using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and quantitative real-time PCR. We also analysed the presence of intact proviral DNA using multiplex ddPCR targeting the packaging signal (psi) and\nenvelope (env). We did intracellular cytokine staining to measure HIV-1-specific T-cell responses. We used low-sensitive and low-avidity antibody assays to measure the humoral response to HIV-1. We predicted the probability\nof rebound using a mathematical model and inference approach. FINDINGS: HIV-1 viral load in plasma remained undetectable in the London patient up to 30 months (last tested on March 4,\n2020), using an assay with a detection limit of 1 copy per mL. The patient's CD4 count was 430 cells per muL (23.5% of total T cells) at 28 months.\nA very low-level positive signal for HIV-1 DNA was recorded in peripheral CD4 memory cells at 28 months. The viral load in semen was undetectable in both plasma (lower limit\nof detection [LLD] <12 copies per mL) and cells (LLD 10 copies per 10(6) cells) at 21 months. CSF was within normal parameters at 25 months, with HIV-1 RNA below\nthe detection limit (LLD 1 copy per mL). HIV-1 DNA by ddPCR was negative in rectum, caecum, and sigmoid colon and terminal ileum tissue samples at 22 months. Lymph-node tissue\nfrom axilla was positive for the long-terminal repeat (33 copies per 10(6) cells) and env (26.1 copies per 10(6) cells), negative for psi and integrase, and negative by the intact\nproviral DNA assay, at 27 months. HIV-1-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses have remained absent at 27 months. Low-avidity Env antibodies have continued to decline. Mathematical modelling suggests that the\nprobability of remission for life (cure) is 98% in the context of 80% donor chimerism in total HIV target cells and greater than 99% probability of remission for life with\n90% donor chimerism. INTERPRETATION: The London patient has been in HIV-1 remission for 30 months with no detectable replication-competent virus in blood, CSF, intestinal tissue, or lymphoid tissue. Donor chimerism\nhas been maintained at 99% in peripheral T cells. We propose that these findings represent HIV-1 cure.

However,\nthe actual benefit of the upfront exposure to the three cytotoxic drugs compared with a preplanned sequential strategy of doublets was not clear, and neither was the feasibility or efficacy\nof therapies after disease progression. We aimed to compare a preplanned strategy of upfront FOLFOXIRI followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression versus a sequence of\nmFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI doublets, in combination with bevacizumab. METHODS: TRIBE2 was an open-label, phase 3, randomised study of patients aged 18-75 years with an Eastern Cooperative\nOncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2, with unresectable, previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, recruited from 58 Italian oncology units. Patients were stratified according to centre, ECOG performance status, primary\ntumour location, and previous adjuvant chemotherapy. A randomisation system incorporating a minimisation algorithm was used to randomly assign patients (1:1) via a masked web-based allocation procedure to two different treatment\nstrategies. In the control group, patients received first-line mFOLFOX6 (85 mg/m(2) of intravenous oxaliplatin concurrently with 200 mg/m(2) of leucovorin over 120 min; 400 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus of fluorouracil; 2400\nmg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg intravenously over 30 min) followed by FOLFIRI (180 mg/m(2) of intravenous irinotecan over 120 min concurrently with 200\nmg/m(2) of leucovorin; 400 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus of fluorouracil; 2400 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab after disease progression. In the experimental group, patients received FOLFOXIRI\n(165 mg/m(2) of intravenous irinotecan over 60 min; 85 mg/m(2) intravenous oxaliplatin concurrently with 200 mg/m(2) of leucovorin over 120 min; 3200 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h)\nplus bevacizumab followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression. Combination treatments were repeated every 14 days for up to eight cycles followed by fluorouracil and leucovorin\n(at the same dose administered at the last induction cycle) plus bevacizumab maintenance until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, or consent withdrawal. Patients and investigators were not masked. The primary\nendpoint was progression-free survival 2, defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression on any treatment given after first disease progression, or death, analysed by intention to treat. Safety\nwas assessed in patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. Study recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02339116. FINDINGS:\nBetween Feb 26, 2015, and May 15, 2017, 679 patients were randomly assigned and received treatment (340 in the control group and 339 in the experimental group). At data cut-off\n(July 30, 2019) median follow-up was 35.9 months (IQR 30.1-41.4). Median progression-free survival 2 was 19.2 months (95% CI 17.3-21.4) in the experimental group and 16.4 months (15.1-17.5) in the\ncontrol group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.88; p=0.0005). During the first-line treatment, the most frequent of all-cause grade 3-4 events were diarrhoea (57 [17%] vs 18 [5%]), neutropenia\n(168 [50%] vs 71 [21%]), and arterial hypertension (25 [7%] vs 35 [10%]) in the experimental group compared with the control group. Serious adverse events occurred in 84 (25%) patients\nin the experimental group and in 56 (17%) patients in the control group. Eight treatment-related deaths were reported in the experimental group (two intestinal occlusions, two intestinal perforations, two sepsis,\none myocardial infarction, and one bleeding) and four in the control group (two occlusions, one perforation, and one pulmonary embolism). After first disease progression, no substantial differences in the incidence\nof grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported between the control and experimental groups, with the exception of neurotoxicity, which was only reported in the experimental group (six [5%]\nof 132 patients). Serious adverse events after disease progression occurred in 20 (15%) patients in the experimental group and 25 (12%) in the control group. Three treatment-related deaths after first\ndisease progression were reported in the experimental group (two intestinal occlusions and one sepsis) and four in the control group (one intestinal occlusion, one intestinal perforation, one cerebrovascular event, and\none sepsis). INTERPRETATION: Upfront FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression seems to be a preferable therapeutic strategy to sequential administration of chemotherapy\ndoublets, in combination with bevacizumab, for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer selected according to the study criteria.

Progress towards these goals has been slower than hoped. We used survey data and national-level indicators of social determinants\nfrom 74 countries to examine change in satisfaction of contraceptive need from a contextual perspective. METHODS: We searched for individual-level data from repeated nationally representative surveys that included information on\nsexual and reproductive health, and created a single dataset by harmonising data from each survey to a standard data specification. We described the relative timings of sexual initiation, first union\n(cohabitation or marriage), and first birth and used logistic regression to show the change in prevalence of sexual activity, demand for contraception, and modern contraceptive use. We used linear regression\nto examine country-level associations between the gender development index and the expected length of time in education for women and the three outcomes: sexual activity, demand for contraception, and modern\ncontraceptive use. We used principal component analysis to describe countries using a combination of social-structural and behavioural indicators and assessed how well the components explained country-level variation in the proportion\nof women using contraception with fractional logistic regression. FINDINGS: In 34 of the 74 countries examined, proportions of all women who were sexually active, not wanting to conceive, and not\nusing a modern contraceptive method decreased over time. Proportions of women who had been sexually active in the past year changed over time in 43 countries, with increases in 30\ncountries; demand for contraception increased in 42 countries, and use of a modern method of contraception increased in 37 countries. Increases over time in met need for contraception were correlated\nwith increases in gender equality and with women's time in education. Regression analysis on the principal components showed that country-level variation in met contraceptive need was largely explained by a\nsingle component that combined behavioural and social-contextual variables. INTERPRETATION: Progress towards satisfying demand for contraception should take account of the changing context in which it is practised. To remove the\nremaining barriers, policy responses-and therefore research priorities-could require a stronger focus on social-structural determinants and broader aspects of sexual health.

Radioactive iodine ((131)I)-labelled metuximab is a radiolabelled monoclonal antibody against the CD147 (also known\nas basigin or HAb18G) antigen that is expressed in HCC. We aimed to examine the role of (131)I-metuximab as an adjuvant therapy after HCC resection. METHODS: This randomised, controlled, multicentre,\nopen-label, phase 2 trial was done at five medical centres in China. Patients aged 18-75 years who underwent curative-intent resection of histologically confirmed HCC expressing CD147 were randomly assigned (1:1)\nby a computer-generated random sequence, stratified by centre, to receive either adjuvant transarterial injection of one dose of 27.75 MBq/kg (131)I-metuximab 4-6 weeks after the hepatectomy (treatment group) or no\nadjuvant treatment (control group). Patients and physicians were not masked to the study groups. The primary outcome was 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered\nwith ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00819650. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2009, and Nov 30, 2012, 485 patients were screened for eligibility. 329 (68%) of these patients were excluded and 156 (32%) were randomly\nassigned to receive either (131)I-metuximab (n=78) or no adjuvant treatment (n=78). The median follow-up was 55.9 months (IQR 18.6-79.4). In the intention-to-treat population, the 5-year RFS was 43.4% (95% CI\n33.6-55.9) in the (131)I-metuximab group and 21.7% (14.2-33.1) in the control group (hazard ratio 0.49 [95% CI 0.34-0.72]; Z=2.96, p=0.0031). (131)I-metuximab-associated adverse events occurred within the first 4 weeks in\n34 (45%) of 76 patients, seven (21%) of whom had grade 3 or 4 adverse events. These adverse events were all resolved with appropriate treatment within 2 weeks of being\nidentified.

However, the timing of this accretion\nremains controversial(5-8). It has been proposed that volatile elements were added to Earth by the late accretion of a late veneer consisting of carbonaceous-chondrite-like material after core formation had ceased(6,9,10).\nThis view could not be reconciled with the ruthenium (Ru) isotope composition of carbonaceous chondrites(5,11), which is distinct from that of the modern mantle(12), or of any known meteorite group(5).\nAs a possible solution, Earth's pre-late-veneer mantle could already have contained a fraction of Ru that was not fully extracted by core formation(13). The presence of such pre-late-veneer Ru can\nonly be established if its isotope composition is distinct from that of the modern mantle. Here we report the first high-precision, mass-independent Ru isotope compositions for Eoarchaean ultramafic rocks from\nsouthwest Greenland, which display a relative (100)Ru excess of 22 parts per million compared with the modern mantle value. This (100)Ru excess indicates that the source of the Eoarchaean rocks\nalready contained a substantial fraction of Ru before the accretion of the late veneer. By 3.7 billion years ago, the mantle beneath southwest Greenland had not yet fully equilibrated with\nlate accreted material. Otherwise, no Ru isotopic difference relative to the modern mantle would be observed. If constraints from other highly siderophile elements besides Ru are also considered(14), the composition\nof the modern mantle can only be reconciled if the late veneer contained substantial amounts of carbonaceous-chondrite-like materials with their characteristic (100)Ru deficits. These data therefore relax previous constraints on\nthe late veneer and are consistent with volatile-rich material from the outer Solar System being delivered to Earth during late accretion.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161386", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32161385", "Title": "Observation of the Kondo screening cloud.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/13 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "When a magnetic impurity exists in a metal, conduction electrons form a spin cloud that screens the impurity spin. This basic phenomenon is called the Kondo effect(1,2). Unlike electric-charge screening,\nthe spin-screening cloud(3-6) occurs quantum coherently, forming spin-singlet entanglement with the impurity. Although the spins interact locally around the impurity, the Kondo cloud can theoretically spread out over several micrometres.\nThe cloud has not so far been detected, and so its physical existence-a fundamental aspect of the Kondo effect-remains controversial(7,8). Here we present experimental evidence of a Kondo cloud extending\nover a length of micrometres, comparable to the theoretical length xiK. In our device, a Kondo impurity is formed in a quantum dot(2,9-11), coupling on one side to a quasi-one-dimensional\nchannel(12) that houses a Fabry-Perot interferometer of various gate-defined lengths L exceeding one micrometre. When we sweep a voltage on the interferometer end gate-separated by L from the quantum dot-to\ninduce Fabry-Perot oscillations in conductance we observe oscillations in the measured Kondo temperature TK, which is a signature of the Kondo cloud at distance L. When L is less than\nxiK the TK oscillation amplitude becomes larger as L becomes smaller, obeying a scaling function of a single parameter L/xiK, whereas when L is greater than xiK the oscillation is\nmuch weaker. Our results reveal that xiK is the only length parameter associated with the Kondo effect, and that the cloud lies mostly within a length of xiK.

In large ensembles, their control and detection via magnetic resonance is widely exploited, for example, in chemistry, medicine, materials science and mining. Nuclear\nspins also featured in early proposals for solid-state quantum computers(1) and demonstrations of quantum search(2) and factoring(3) algorithms. Scaling up such concepts requires controlling individual nuclei, which can be detected\nwhen coupled to an electron(4-6). However, the need to address the nuclei via oscillating magnetic fields complicates their integration in multi-spin nanoscale devices, because the field cannot be localized or\nscreened. Control via electric fields would resolve this problem, but previous methods(7-9) relied on transducing electric signals into magnetic fields via the electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction, which severely affects nuclear coherence.\nHere we demonstrate the coherent quantum control of a single (123)Sb (spin-7/2) nucleus using localized electric fields produced within a silicon nanoelectronic device. The method exploits an idea proposed in\n1961(10) but not previously realized experimentally with a single nucleus. Our results are quantitatively supported by a microscopic theoretical model that reveals how the purely electrical modulation of the nuclear\nelectric quadrupole interaction results in coherent nuclear spin transitions that are uniquely addressable owing to lattice strain. The spin dephasing time, 0.1 seconds, is orders of magnitude longer than those\nobtained by methods that require a coupled electron spin to achieve electrical driving. These results show that high-spin quadrupolar nuclei could be deployed as chaotic models, strain sensors and hybrid\nspin-mechanical quantum systems using all-electrical controls. Integrating electrically controllable nuclei with quantum dots(11,12) could pave the way to scalable, nuclear- and electron-spin-based quantum computers in silicon that operate without the\nneed for oscillating magnetic fields.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161384", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32161383", "Title": "Current-driven magnetic domain-wall logic.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/13 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "Spin-based logic architectures provide nonvolatile data retention, near-zero leakage, and scalability, extending the technology roadmap beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic(1-13). Architectures based on magnetic domain walls take advantage of the fast\nmotion, high density, non-volatility and flexible design of domain walls to process and store information(1,3,14-16). Such schemes, however, rely on domain-wall manipulation and clocking using an external magnetic field, which\nlimits their implementation in dense, large-scale chips. Here we demonstrate a method for performing all-electric logic operations and cascading using domain-wall racetracks. We exploit the chiral coupling between neighbouring magnetic\ndomains induced by the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction(17-20), which promotes non-collinear spin alignment, to realize a domain-wall inverter, the essential basic building block in all implementations of Boolean logic. We then\nfabricate reconfigurable NAND and NOR logic gates, and perform operations with current-induced domain-wall motion. Finally, we cascade several NAND gates to build XOR and full adder gates, demonstrating electrical control\nof magnetic data and device interconnection in logic circuits. Our work provides a viable platform for scalable all-electric magnetic logic, paving the way for memory-in-logic applications.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161383", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32161382", "Title": "Ancient rock bears isotopic fingerprints of Earth's origins.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/17 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161382", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32161381", "Title": "Tiny bird fossil might be the world's smallest dinosaur.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/17 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161381", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32161380", "Title": "An all-electrical magnetic logic gate that harnesses chirality between domains.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/17 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161380", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32161364", "Title": "Nightside condensation of iron in an ultrahot giant exoplanet.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/13 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 11", "Abstract": "Ultra-hot giant exoplanets receive thousands of times Earth's insolation(1,2). Their high-temperature atmospheres (greater than 2,000 kelvin) are ideal laboratories for studying extreme planetary climates and chemistry(3-5). Daysides are predicted to\nbe cloud-free, dominated by atomic species(6) and substantially hotter than nightsides(5,7,8). Atoms are expected to recombine into molecules over the nightside(9), resulting in different day-night chemistry. While metallic elements and\na large temperature contrast have been observed(10-14), no chemical gradient has been measured across the surface of such an exoplanet. Different atmospheric chemistry between the day-to-night ('evening') and night-to-day ('morning')\nterminators could, however, be revealed as an asymmetric absorption signature during transit(4,7,15). Here we report the detection of an asymmetric atmospheric signature in the ultrahot exoplanet WASP-76b. We spectrally and\ntemporally resolve this signature using a combination of high-dispersion spectroscopy with a large photon-collecting area. The absorption signal, attributed to neutral iron, is blueshifted by -11+/-0.7 kilometres per second on\nthe trailing limb, which can be explained by a combination of planetary rotation and wind blowing from the hot dayside(16). In contrast, no signal arises from the nightside close to\nthe morning terminator, showing that atomic iron is not absorbing starlight there. Iron must thus condense during its journey across the nightside.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161364", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal]

postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Systematic\nreview and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINHAL, and CENTRAL from January 1990 to December 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials investigating short term, protocolised medical\ninterventions conducted before, during, or after non-cardiac surgery were included. Trials with clinical diagnostic criteria for PPC outcomes were included. Studies of surgical technique or physiological or biochemical outcomes were\nexcluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of evidence. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Quality of\nevidence was summarised in accordance with GRADE methods. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs. Secondary outcomes were respiratory infection, atelectasis, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Trial sequential\nanalysis was used to investigate the reliability and conclusiveness of available evidence. Adverse effects of interventions were not measured or compared. RESULTS: 117 trials enrolled 21 940 participants, investigating 11\ncategories of intervention. 95 randomised controlled trials enrolling 18 062 participants were included in meta-analysis; 22 trials were excluded from meta-analysis because the interventions were not sufficiently similar to be\npooled. No high quality evidence was found for interventions to reduce the primary outcome (incidence of PPCs). Seven interventions had low or moderate quality evidence with confidence intervals indicating a\nprobable reduction in PPCs: enhanced recovery pathways (risk ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.58), prophylactic mucolytics (0.40, 0.23 to 0.67), postoperative continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (0.49, 0.24\nto 0.99), lung protective intraoperative ventilation (0.52, 0.30 to 0.88), prophylactic respiratory physiotherapy (0.55, 0.32 to 0.93), epidural analgesia (0.77, 0.65 to 0.92), and goal directed haemodynamic therapy (0.87, 0.77\nto 0.98). Moderate quality evidence showed no benefit for incentive spirometry in preventing PPCs. Trial sequential analysis adjustment confidently supported a relative risk reduction of 25% in PPCs for prophylactic\nrespiratory physiotherapy, epidural analgesia, enhanced recovery pathways, and goal directed haemodynamic therapies. Insufficient data were available to support or refute equivalent relative risk reductions for other interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Predominantly low\nquality evidence favours multiple perioperative PPC reduction strategies. Clinicians may choose to reassess their perioperative care pathways, but the results indicate that new trials with a low risk of bias\nare needed to obtain conclusive evidence of efficacy for many of these interventions.

DESIGN: Prospective population based study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 230 390 commuters (52.1% women; mean age 52.4 years)\nrecruited from 22 sites across the UK compared by mode of transport used (walking, cycling, mixed mode versus non-active (car or public transport)) to commute to and from work on\na typical day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: First incident admission to hospital for injury. RESULTS: 5704 (2.5%) participants reported cycling as their main form of commuter transport. Median follow-up was 8.9\nyears (interquartile range 8.2-9.5 years), and overall 10 241 (4.4%) participants experienced an injury. Injuries occurred in 397 (7.0%) of the commuters who cycled and 7698 (4.3%) of the commuters\nwho used a non-active mode of transport. After adjustment for major confounding sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle factors, cycling to work was associated with a higher risk of injury compared with\ncommuting by a non-active mode (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 1.61). Similar trends were observed for commuters who used mixed mode cycling. Walking to work was not\nassociated with a higher risk of injury. Longer cycling distances during commuting were associated with a higher risk of injury, but commute distance was not associated with injury in non-active\ncommuters. Cycle commuting was also associated with a higher number of injuries when the external cause was a transport related incident (incident rate ratio 3.42, 95% confidence interval 3.00 to\n3.90). Commuters who cycled to work had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and death than those who did not. If the associations are causal, an estimated 1000 participants\nchanging their mode of commuting to include cycling for 10 years would result in 26 additional admissions to hospital for a first injury (of which three would require a hospital\nstay of a week or longer), 15 fewer first cancer diagnoses, four fewer cardiovascular disease events, and three fewer deaths. CONCLUSION: Compared with non-active commuting to work, commuting by cycling\nwas associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for a first injury and higher risk of transport related incidents specifically. These risks should be viewed in context of the\nhealth benefits of active commuting and underscore the need for a safer infrastructure for cycling in the UK.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161038", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32161036", "Title": "Tranexamic acid is safe to use following mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/13 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 11", "Abstract": "The studyThe CRASH-3 Trial Collaborators.

of tuberculosis development after a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay result (IGRA), or both, among untreated populations with characteristics believed\nto increase the risk of tuberculosis (at risk populations). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials from 1 January 1990 to 17\nMay 2019, for studies in humans published in English or French. Reference lists were reviewed. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND DATA ANALYSIS: Retrospective or prospective cohorts and randomised trials that included at\nleast 10 untreated participants who tested positive to tuberculosis antigens (contained in TST or IGRA, or both) followed for at least 12 months. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic\nreviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed quality using a modified quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy\nstudies (QUADAS-2) tool. Data were pooled using random effects generalised linear mixed models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was tuberculosis incidence per 1000 person years among untreated participants who\ntested positive (TST or IGRA, or both) in different at risk subgroups. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of tuberculosis and incidence rate ratios among participants with a positive test\nresult for latent tuberculosis infection compared with those with a negative test result in at risk subgroups. RESULTS: 122 of 5166 identified studies were included. In three general population studies,\nthe incidence of tuberculosis among 33 811 participants with a TST induration of >/=10 mm was 0.3 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.1) per 1000 person years. Among 116 197\npositive test results for latent tuberculosis infection in 19 different at risk populations, incidence rates were consistently higher than those in the general population. Among all types of tuberculosis contacts,\nthe incidence of tuberculosis was 17.0 (95% confidence interval 12.9 to 22.4) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive IGRA result and 8.4 (5.6 to 12.6) per 1000\nperson years for participants with a positive TST result of >/=5 mm. Among people living with HIV, the incidence of tuberculosis was 16.9 (10.5 to 27.3) for participants with a\npositive IGRA result and 27.1 (15.0 to 49.0) for participants with a positive TST result of >/=5 mm. Rates were also high for immigrants, people with silicosis or requiring dialysis,\ntransplant recipients, and prisoners. Incidence rate ratios among test positive versus test negative participants were significantly greater than 1.0 in almost all risk groups, for all tests. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence\nof tuberculosis is substantial in numerous at risk populations after a positive TST or IGRA result. The information from this review should help inform clinical decisions to test and treat\nfor latent tuberculosis infection.

Aged 65 Years or Older, 2004 to 2017.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 10", "Abstract": "Importance: Medicare beneficiaries who are also enrolled in Medicaid (dually enrolled beneficiaries) have drawn the attention of policy makers because they comprise the poorest subset of the Medicare population; however,\nit is unclear how their outcomes have changed over time compared with those only enrolled in Medicare (nondually enrolled beneficiaries). Objective: To evaluate annual changes in all-cause mortality, hospitalization rates,\nand hospitalization-related mortality among dually enrolled beneficiaries and nondually enrolled beneficiaries. Design, Setting, and Participants: Serial cross-sectional study of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older between January 2004\nand December 2017. The final date of follow-up was September 30, 2018. Exposures: Dual vs nondual enrollment status. Main Outcomes and Measures: Annual all-cause mortality rates; all-cause hospitalization rates; and\nin-hospital, 30-day, 1-year hospitalization-related mortality rates. Results: There were 71017608 unique Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older (mean age, 75.6 [SD, 9.2] years; 54.9% female) enrolled in Medicare for\nat least 1 month from 2004 through 2017. Of these beneficiaries, 11697900 (16.5%) were dually enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid for at least 1 month. After adjusting for age, sex,\nand race, annual all-cause mortality rates declined from 8.5% (95% CI, 8.45%-8.56%) in 2004 to 8.1% (95% CI, 8.05%-8.13%) in 2017 among dually enrolled beneficiaries and from 4.1% (95% CI,\n4.08%-4.13%) in 2004 to 3.8% (95% CI, 3.76%-3.79%) in 2017 among nondually enrolled beneficiaries. The difference in annual all-cause mortality between dually and nondually enrolled beneficiaries increased between 2004 (adjusted\nodds ratio, 2.09 [95% CI, 2.08-2.10]) and 2017 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.22 [95% CI, 2.21-2.23]) (P < .001 for interaction between dual enrollment status and time). All-cause hospitalizations per 100000\nbeneficiary-years declined from 49888 in 2004 to 41121 in 2017 among dually enrolled beneficiaries (P < .001) and from 29000 in 2004 to 22601 in 2017 among nondually enrolled beneficiaries\n(P < .001); however, the difference between these groups widened between 2004 (adjusted risk ratio, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.71-1.73]) and 2017 (adjusted risk ratio, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.82-1.83]) (P <\n.001 for interaction). Among hospitalized beneficiaries, the risk-adjusted 30-day mortality rates declined from 10.3% (95% CI, 10.22%-10.33%) in 2004 to 10.1% (95% CI, 10.02%-10.20%) in 2017 among dually enrolled beneficiaries\nand from 8.5% (95% CI, 8.50%-8.56%) in 2004 to 8.1% (95% CI, 8.06%-8.13%) in 2017 among nondually enrolled beneficiaries. In contrast, 1-year mortality increased among hospitalized beneficiaries from 23.1% (95%\nCI, 23.05%-23.20%) in 2004 to 26.7% (95% CI, 26.58%-26.84%) in 2017 among dually enrolled beneficiaries and from 18.1% (95% CI, 18.11%-18.17%) in 2004 to 20.3% (95% CI, 20.21%-20.31%) in 2017\namong nondually enrolled beneficiaries. The difference in hospitalization-related outcomes between dually and nondually enrolled beneficiaries persisted during the study period. Conclusions and Relevance: Among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years\nor older, dually enrolled beneficiaries had higher annual all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalizations, and hospitalization-related mortality compared with nondually enrolled beneficiaries. Between 2004 and 2017, these differences did not decrease.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32154858", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR

"Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/11 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 9", "Abstract": "On average, an approved drug today costs $2-3 billion and takes over ten years to develop(1). In part, this is due to expensive and time-consuming wet-lab experiments, poor initial hit\ncompounds, and the high attrition rates in the (pre-)clinical phases. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) has the potential to mitigate these problems. With SBVS, the quality of the hits improves with\nthe number of compounds screened(2). However, despite the fact that large compound databases exist, the ability to carry out large-scale SBVSs on computer clusters in an accessible, efficient, and flexible\nmanner has remained elusive. Here we designed VirtualFlow, a highly automated and versatile open-source platform with perfect scaling behaviour that is able to prepare and efficiently screen ultra-large ligand libraries\nof compounds. VirtualFlow is able to use a variety of the most powerful docking programs. Using VirtualFlow, we have prepared the largest and freely available ready-to-dock ligand library available, with\nover 1.4 billion commercially available molecules. To demonstrate the power of VirtualFlow, we screened over 1 billion compounds and discovered a small molecule inhibitor (iKeap1) that engages KEAP1 with nanomolar\naffinity (Kd = 114 nM) and disrupts the interaction between KEAP1 and the transcription factor NRF2.

We aimed to reduce inappropriate use of catheters to reduce health care-associated infections. METHODS: In this\nmulticentre, interrupted time-series and before and after study, we introduced a de-implementation strategy with multifaceted interventions in seven hospitals in the Netherlands. Adult patients admitted to internal medicine, gastroenterology, geriatic,\noncology, or pulmonology wards, and non-surgical acute admission units, and who had a (central or peripheral) venous or urinary catheter were eligible for inclusion. One of the interventions was that\nnurses in the participating wards attended educational meetings on appropriate catheter use. Data on catheter use were collected every 2 weeks by the primary research physician during the baseline period\n(7 months) and intervention period (7 months), which were separated by a 5 month transition period. The primary outcomes were percentages of short peripheral intravenous catheters and urinary catheters used\ninappropriately on the days of data collection. Indications for catheter use were based on international guidelines. This study is registered with Netherlands Trial Register, NL5438. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2016,\nand April 1, 2018, we screened 6157 patients for inclusion, of whom 5696 were enrolled: 2650 patients in the baseline group, and 3046 in the intervention group. Inappropriate use of\nperipheral intravenous catheters occurred in 366 (22.0%, 95% CI 20.0 to 24.0) of 1665 patients in the baseline group and in 275 (14.4%, 12.8 to 16.0) of 1912 patients in\nthe intervention group (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.77, p<0.0001). Time-series analyses showed an absolute reduction in inappropriate use of peripheral intravenous catheters from baseline to\nintervention periods of 6.65% (95% CI 2.47 to 10.82, p=0.011). Inappropriate use of urinary catheters occurred in 105 (32.4%, 95% CI 27.3 to 37.8) of 324 patients in the baseline\ngroup compared with 96 (24.1%, 20.0 to 28.6) of 398 patients in the intervention group (IRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98, p=0.013). Time-series analyses showed an absolute reduction in\ninappropriate use of urinary catheters of 6.34% (95% CI -12.46 to 25.13, p=0.524). INTERPRETATION: Our de-implementation strategy reduced inappropriate use of short peripheral intravenous catheters in patients who were not\nin the intensive care unit. The reduction of inappropriate use of urinary catheters was substantial, yet not statistically significant in time-series analysis due to a small sample size. The strategy\nappears well suited for broad-scale implementation to reduce health care-associated infections.

We aimed to describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-defined CRE in the USA. METHODS:\nCRACKLE-2 is a prospective, multicentre, cohort study. Patients hospitalised in 49 US hospitals, with clinical cultures positive for CDC-defined CRE between April 30, 2016, and Aug 31, 2017, were included.\nThere was no age exclusion. The primary outcome was desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) at 30 days after index culture. Clinical data and bacteria were collected, and whole genome sequencing\nwas done. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03646227. FINDINGS: 1040 patients with unique isolates were included, 449 (43%) with infection and 591 (57%) with colonisation. The CDC-defined CRE\nadmission rate was 57 per 100 000 admissions (95% CI 45-71). Three subsets of CDC-defined CRE were identified: carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (618 [59%] of 1040), non-carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (194 [19%]), and unconfirmed\nCRE (228 [22%]; initially reported as CRE, but susceptible to carbapenems in two central laboratories). Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing clonal group 258 K pneumoniae was the most common carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales. In\n449 patients with CDC-defined CRE infections, DOOR outcomes were not significantly different in patients with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, non-carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, and unconfirmed CRE. At 30 days 107 (24%, 95% CI 20-28)\nof these patients had died. INTERPRETATION: Among patients with CDC-defined CRE, similar outcomes were observed among three subgroups, including the novel unconfirmed CRE group. CDC-defined CRE represent diverse bacteria, whose\nspread might not respond to interventions directed to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales.

Therefore,\nthe aim of our study was to estimate global-level, regional-level, and country-level numbers and percentages of children living in institutional care. METHODS: In this estimation study, we did a systematic\nreview of peer-reviewed publications and a comprehensive review of surveys and unpublished literature to construct a dataset on children living in institutional care from 136 countries between 2001 and 2018.\nWe applied a wide range of methods to estimate the number and percentages of children living in institutional care in 191 countries in 2015, the year the Sustainable Development Goals\nwere adopted. We generated 98 sets of estimates for each dataset, with possible combinations of imputation methods for countries with different available data points. Of these 98 sets, we report\nhere five types of global-level estimates: estimates with the highest values, those with the lowest values, those with median values, those with uncertainty levels, and those derived from methods with\nthe smallest root-mean-square errors (RMSE). FINDINGS: Global estimates of children living in institutions in 2015 was highly sensitive to the methods and data used, ranging from 3.18 million to 9.42\nmillion children, with a median estimate of 5.37 million. When selecting the method with the lowest RMSE, the global estimate was 4.21 million, whereas with negative binomial regression with bootstrapping,\nthe global estimate was 7.52 (95% CI 7.48-7.56) million. We also observed large variations in country-level estimates. Compared with other regions, estimates in south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America\nhad larger variations in values when switching between estimation methods. High-income countries had the highest average prevalence of institutionalisation, whereas low-income countries had the lowest average prevalence. Estimates from the\nfull data with the smallest RMSE method showed that south Asia had the largest estimated number of children living in institutions (1.13 million), followed by Europe and central Asia (1.01\nmillion), east Asia and Pacific (0.78 million), sub-Saharan Africa (0.65 million), Middle East and North Africa (0.30 million), Latin America and the Caribbean (0.23 million), and North America (0.09 million).\nNorth America consistently had the lowest estimates among all regions. INTERPRETATION: Worldwide, institutional care places millions of children at elevated risk of negative health and developmental outcomes, highlighting the need\nfor deinstitutionalisation. However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the number of children living in institutions. To improve estimates of the size of this population, we need to standardise the definition\nof institutional care and improve data collection, particularly in countries with large child populations.

We aimed\nto establish the effects of nintedanib in subgroups based on ILD diagnosis. METHODS: The INBUILD trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial done at 153 sites in 15\ncountries. Participants had an investigator-diagnosed fibrosing ILD other than IPF, with chest imaging features of fibrosis of more than 10% extent on high resolution CT (HRCT), forced vital capacity (FVC)\nof 45% or more predicted, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) of at least 30% and less than 80% predicted. Participants fulfilled protocol-defined criteria for ILD\nprogression in the 24 months before screening, despite management considered appropriate in clinical practice for the individual ILD. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 by means of a pseudo-random number generator\nto receive nintedanib 150 mg twice daily or placebo for at least 52 weeks. Participants, investigators, and other personnel involved in the trial and analysis were masked to treatment assignment\nuntil after database lock. In this subgroup analysis, we assessed the rate of decline in FVC (mL/year) over 52 weeks in patients who received at least one dose of nintedanib\nor placebo in five prespecified subgroups based on the ILD diagnoses documented by the investigators: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, autoimmune ILDs, idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia, unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, and other ILDs.\nThe trial has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02999178. FINDINGS: Participants were recruited between Feb 23, 2017, and April 27, 2018. Of 663 participants who received at\nleast one dose of nintedanib or placebo, 173 (26%) had chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, 170 (26%) an autoimmune ILD, 125 (19%) idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia, 114 (17%) unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia,\nand 81 (12%) other ILDs. The effect of nintedanib versus placebo on reducing the rate of FVC decline (mL/year) was consistent across the five subgroups by ILD diagnosis in the\noverall population (hypersensitivity pneumonitis 73.1 [95% CI -8.6 to 154.8]; autoimmune ILDs 104.0 [21.1 to 186.9]; idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia 141.6 [46.0 to 237.2]; unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia 68.3 [-31.4\nto 168.1]; and other ILDs 197.1 [77.6 to 316.7]; p=0.41 for treatment by subgroup by time interaction). Adverse events reported in the subgroups were consistent with those reported in the\noverall population. INTERPRETATION: The INBUILD trial was not designed or powered to provide evidence for a benefit of nintedanib in specific diagnostic subgroups.

In this study, we aimed to investigate optimal treatment strategies for advanced stage disease in areas of high prevalence and limited resources. METHODS: In this\nopen-label, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled people with HIV and advanced stage AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma attending 11 AIDS Clinical Trials Group sites in Brazil, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\nEligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) with a centralised computer system to receive either intravenous bleomycin and vincristine or oral etoposide (the investigational arms), or intravenous paclitaxel (the control arm),\ntogether with antiretroviral therapy (ART; combined efavirenz, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and emtricitabine). The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) at week 48, using a 15% non-inferiority margin to compare the\ninvestigational groups against the active control group. Safety was assessed in all eligible treated study participants. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01435018. FINDINGS: 334 participants were enrolled between Oct\n1, 2013, and March 8, 2018, when the study was closed early due to inferiority of the bleomycin and vincristine plus ART arm, as per the recommendations of the Data\nand Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The etoposide plus ART arm also closed due to inferiority in March, 2016, following a DSMB recommendation. Week-48 PFS rates were higher in the paclitaxel\nplus ART arm than in both investigational arms. The absolute differences in PFS were -30% (95% CI -52 to -8) for the comparison of paclitaxel plus ART (week 48 PFS\n50%, 32 to 67; n=59) and etoposide plus ART (20%, 6 to 33; n=59), and -20% (-33% to -7%) for the comparison of paclitaxel plus ART (64%, 55 to 73;\nn=138) and bleomycin and vincristine plus ART (44%, 35 to 53; n=132). Both CIs overlapped the non-inferiority margin. The most common adverse events, in 329 eligible participants who began treatment,\nwere neutropenia (48 [15%]), low serum albumin (33 [10%]), weight loss (29 [9%]), and anaemia (28 [9%]), occurring at similar frequency across treatment arms. INTERPRETATION: Non-inferiority of either investigational intervention\nwas not shown, with paclitaxel plus ART showing superiority to both oral etoposide plus ART and bleomycin and vincristine plus ART, supporting its use in treating advanced AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma\nin resource-limited settings.

No international consensus exists on the benefit of\nadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with UTUCs after nephroureterectomy with curative intent. The POUT (Peri-Operative chemotherapy versus sUrveillance in upper Tract urothelial cancer) trial aimed to assess the efficacy of systemic\nplatinum-based chemotherapy in patients with UTUCs. METHODS: We did a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 71 hospitals in the UK. We recruited patients with UTUC after nephroureterectomy staged\nas either pT2-T4 pN0-N3 M0 or pTany N1-3 M0. We randomly allocated participants centrally (1:1) to either surveillance or four 21-day cycles of chemotherapy, using a minimisation algorithm with a\nrandom element. Chemotherapy was either cisplatin (70 mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC]4.5/AUC5, for glomerular filtration rate <50 mL/min only) administered intravenously on day 1 and gemcitabine (1000\nmg/m(2)) administered intravenously on days 1 and 8; chemotherapy was initiated within 90 days of surgery. Follow-up included standard cystoscopic, radiological, and clinical assessments. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival\nanalysed by intention to treat with a Peto-Haybittle stopping rule for (in)efficacy. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01993979. A preplanned interim analysis met the efficacy criterion for early closure\nafter recruitment of 261 participants. FINDINGS: Between June 19, 2012, and Nov 8, 2017, we enrolled 261 participants from 57 of 71 open study sites. 132 patients were assigned chemotherapy\nand 129 surveillance. One participant allocated chemotherapy withdrew consent for data use after randomisation and was excluded from analyses. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI\n0.30-0.68; p=0.0001) at a median follow-up of 30.3 months (IQR 18.0-47.5). 3-year event-free estimates were 71% (95% CI 61-78) and 46% (36-56) for chemotherapy and surveillance, respectively. 55 (44%) of\n126 participants who started chemotherapy had acute grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events, which accorded with frequently reported events for the chemotherapy regimen. Five (4%) of 129 patients managed\nby surveillance had acute grade 3 or worse emergent adverse events. No treatment-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: Gemcitabine-platinum combination chemotherapy initiated within 90 days after nephroureterectomy significantly improved disease-free survival\nin patients with locally advanced UTUC. Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy should be considered a new standard of care after nephroureterectomy for this patient population.

The aim of this Review is to provide a summary of knowledge on placebo controls\nin surgical trials. A placebo control is a complex type of comparison group in the surgical setting and, although powerful, presents many challenges. This Review outlines what a placebo control\nentails and present understanding of this tool in the context of surgery. We consider when placebo controls in surgery are acceptable (and when they are desirable) in terms of ethical\narguments and regulatory requirements, how a placebo control should be designed, how to identify and mitigate risk for participants in these trials, and how such trials should be done and\ninterpreted. Use of placebo controls is justified in randomised controlled trials of surgical interventions provided there is a strong scientific and ethical rationale. Surgical placebos might be most appropriate when\nthere is poor evidence for the efficacy of the procedure and a justified concern that results of a trial would be associated with high risk of bias, particularly because of\nthe placebo effect. Feasibility work is recommended to optimise the design and implementation of randomised controlled trials.

More recently, improvement\nin overall survival has been reported with ribociclib and abemaciclib. The toxicity profile of all three drugs is well described and generally easily manageable with dose reductions when indicated. More\nmyelotoxicity is observed with palbociclib and ribociclib, but more gastrointestinal toxicity is observed with abemaciclib. Emerging data is shedding light on the resistance mechanisms associated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, including cell\ncycle alterations and activation of upstream tyrosine kinase receptors.

with mutant IDH2 myelodysplastic syndromes: a phase 1 subgroup analysis of the multicentre, AG221-C-001 trial.", "JournalName": "The Lancet. Haematology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/09 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 5", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) occur in around 5% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Neomorphic activity of mutant IDH2 proteins results in hypermethylation of DNA and histones, leading to\nblocked haemopoietic differentiation. Enasidenib, an inhibitor of mutated IDH2 proteins, induces responses in patients with IDH2-mutated, relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. We aimed to establish the clinical outcomes of\nenasidenib monotherapy in a subgroup of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes harbouring mutations in IDH2 from the AG221-C-001 trial. METHODS: The multicentre, open-label, phase 1-2 AG221-C-001 trial enrolled patients with advanced\nhaematological malignancies (2008 WHO criteria) harbouring an IDH2 mutation. The present study is a subgroup analysis of patients with IDH2-mutated myelodysplastic syndromes in the phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion portions\nof the trial. Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were aged 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status score of 2 or lower, and were relapsed or refractory to, or\nineligible for, standard treatments. Patients received oral doses of enasidenib at 60-300 mg per day in repeated 28-day treatment cycles. In this subgroup analysis, we focused on the safety and\nactivity of enasidenib as main outcomes. Overall response rate, duration of response, and overall and event-free survival analyses were by intention-to-treat. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at\nleast one dose of study drug in terms of treatment-emergent adverse events. The AG221-C-001 trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01915498, status ongoing but closed to recruitment. FINDINGS: 17 patients with\nmyelodysplastic syndromes harbouring an IDH2 mutation (median age, 67.0 years [IQR 60.5-73.0]) were enrolled between Feb 18, 2014, and Sept 1, 2015. At data cutoff (Oct 1, 2018), after a\nmedian follow-up of 11.0 months (IQR 6.8-23.0), all patients had discontinued enasidenib, with a median of 3 treatment cycles (2-15) for all patients (five [29%] received >/=12 cycles). At entry,\nthree (18%) patients had relapsed after allogeneic stem-cell transplants, 13 (76%) had previously received therapy with hypomethylating agents, and ten (59%) had received at least two previous therapies. No dose-limiting\ntoxicities were reported. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea and nausea (in nine [53%] patients each). Most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were indirect hyperbilirubinaemia (in six\n[35%] patients), pneumonia (in five [29%] patients), and thrombocytopaenia (in four [24%] patients). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events in more than one patient were pneumonia (in five [29% patients); tumor lysis\nsyndrome (in three [18%] patients); and sepsis, atrial flutter, indirect hyperbilirubinaemia, cerebral hemorrhage, and mental status change (in two [12%] patients each). No treatment-related deaths occurred. An overall response was\nachieved in 9 patients (53% [95% CI 28-77]), with a median duration of response of 9.2 months (95% CI 1.0-not reached). Six (46%) of 13 patients previously treated with hypomethylating\nagents responded. Median overall survival was 16.9 months (95% CI 1.5-32.3), and median event-free survival was 11.0 months (1.5-16.7). INTERPRETATION: Enasidenib is generally well tolerated and can induce responses in\npatients with mutant IDH2 myelodysplastic syndromes, including in those who have had previous therapy with hypomethylating agents. Testing for IDH2 mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes is essential for identifying patients who\nmight benefit from enasidenib therapy, including those patients in whom conventional treatments have been unsuccessful.

Psychiatry", "Creation Date": "2020/03/09 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevated risk of psychotic disorders in migrant groups is a public mental health priority. We investigated whether living in areas of high own-region migrant density was associated with reduced\nrisk of psychotic disorders among migrants and their children, and whether generation status, probable visible minority status, or region-of-origin affected this relationship. METHODS: We used the Swedish registers to identify\nmigrants and their children born between Jan 1, 1982, and Dec 31, 1996, and living in Sweden on or after their 15th birthday. We tracked all included participants from age\n15 years or date of migration until emigration, death, or study end (Dec 31, 2016). The outcome was an ICD-10 diagnosis of non-affective psychosis (F20-29). We calculated own-region and generation-specific\nown-region density within the 9208 small areas for market statistics neighbourhoods in Sweden, and estimated the relationship between density and diagnosis of non-affective psychotic disorders using multilevel Cox proportional hazards\nmodels, adjusting for individual confounders (generation status, age, sex, calendar year, lone dwelling, and time since migration [migrants only]), family confounders (family income, family unemployment, and social welfare), and neighbourhood\nconfounders (deprivation index, population density, and proportion of lone dwellings), and using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to compare model fit. FINDINGS: Of 468 223 individuals included in the final\ncohort, 4582 (1.0%) had non-affective psychotic disorder. Lower own-region migrant density was associated with increased risk of psychotic disorders among migrants (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.07 per 5%\ndecrease) and children of migrants (1.03, 1.01-1.06), after adjustment. These effects were stronger for probable visible minority migrants (1.07, 1.04-1.11), including migrants from Asia (1.42, 1.15-1.76) and sub-Saharan Africa (1.28,\n1.15-1.44), but not migrants from probable non-visible minority backgrounds (0.99, 0.94-1.04). Among migrants, adding generation status to the measure of own-region density provided a better fit to the data than\noverall own-region migrant density (AIC 36 103 vs 36 106, respectively), with a 5% decrease in generation-specific migrant density corresponding to a HR of 1.07 (1.04-1.11). INTERPRETATION: Migrant density was\nassociated with non-affective psychosis risk in migrants and their children. Stronger protective effects of migrant density were found for probable visible minority migrants and migrants from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\nFor migrants, this risk intersected with generation status. Together, these results suggest that this health inequality is socially constructed.

We aimed to identify optimal combination implementation strategies of evidence-based interventions to reach 90% reduction of\nincidence in 10 years, in six US cities that comprise 24.1% of people living with HIV in the USA. METHODS: In this economic modelling study, we used a dynamic HIV\ntransmission model calibrated with the best available evidence on epidemiological and structural conditions for six US cities: Atlanta (GA), Baltimore (MD), Los Angeles (CA), Miami (FL), New York City (NY),\nand Seattle (WA). We assessed 23 040 combinations of 16 evidence-based interventions (ie, HIV prevention, testing, treatment, engagement, and re-engagement) to identify combination strategies providing the greatest health benefit while\nremaining cost-effective. Main outcomes included averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total cost (in 2018 US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; from the health-care sector perspective, 3% annual discount rate).\nInterventions were implemented at previously documented and ideal (90% coverage or adoption) scale-up, and sustained from 2020 to 2030, with outcomes evaluated until 2040. FINDINGS: Optimal combination strategies providing health\nbenefit and cost-effectiveness contained between nine (Seattle) and 13 (Miami) individual interventions. If implemented at previously documented scale-up, these strategies could reduce incidence by between 30.7% (95% credible interval 19.1-43.7;\nSeattle) and 50.1% (41.5-58.0; New York City) by 2030, at ICERs ranging from cost-saving in Atlanta, Baltimore, and Miami, to $95 416 per QALY in Seattle. Incidence reductions reached between\n39.5% (26.3-53.8) in Seattle and 83.6% (70.8-87.0) in Baltimore at ideal implementation. Total costs of implementing strategies across the cities at previously documented scale-up reached $559 million per year in\n2024; however, costs were offset by long-term reductions in new infections and delayed disease progression, with Atlanta, Baltimore, and Miami projecting cost savings over the 20 year study period. INTERPRETATION:\nEvidence-based interventions can deliver substantial public health and economic value; however, complementary strategies to overcome social and structural barriers to HIV care will be required to reach national targets of\nthe ending the HIV epidemic initiative by 2030.

As such, a control group that receives a placebo vaccine followed by controlled exposure to a pathogen should be scientifically well justified.

An increasing number of disabling or fatal paediatric neurological disorders linked to mutations of voltage-gated sodium channel\ngenes are recognised. Muscle phenotypes include episodic paralysis, myotonia, neonatal hypotonia, respiratory compromise, laryngospasm or stridor, congenital myasthenia, and myopathy. Evidence suggests a possible link between sodium channel dysfunction and\nsudden infant death. Increasingly recognised phenotypes of brain sodium channelopathies include several epilepsy disorders and complex encephalopathies. Together, these early-onset muscle and brain phenotypes have a substantial morbidity and a\nconsiderable mortality. Important advances in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these channelopathies have helped to identify effective targeted therapies. The availability of effective treatments underlines the importance of increasing clinical\nawareness and the need to achieve a precise genetic diagnosis.

Diabetes & endocrinology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In type 2 diabetes, long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists lower fasting plasma glucose and improve glycaemic control via their insulinotropic and glucagonostatic effects. In type 1 diabetes, their efficacy as\nan add-on treatment to insulin therapy is modest. Short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists also lower postprandial glucose excursions in type 2 diabetes by decelerating gastric emptying rate. We aimed to test\nthe efficacy of a short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist in type 1 diabetes. METHODS: In the single-centre, parallel-group, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled MAG1C trial, patients with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily\ninjection therapy aged 18 years and older with HbA1c 59-88 mmol/mol (7.5-10.0%) and a BMI of more than 22.0 kg/m(2) were randomly assigned (1:1) through a computer-generated randomisation list to\npreprandial subcutaneous injection of 10 mug exenatide (Byetta) or placebo three times daily for 26 weeks as an add-on treatment to usual insulin therapy. Clinically assessed insulin titration was done\nby study staff. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was between-group difference in HbA1c after 26 weeks. Data were analysed with a baseline-adjusted linear mixed\nmodel in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03017352, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Jan 4, 2017, and Jan 16, 2019, 108 participants were randomly assigned, 54\nto exenatide and 54 to placebo; 23 participants discontinued treatment (17 in the exenatide group and six in the placebo group). From a baseline-adjusted mean of 66.4 mmol/mol (95% CI\n64.9-67.8 [8.2%, 8.1-8.4]), HbA1c changed by -3.2 mmol/mol (-5.0 to -1.4 [-0.3%, -0.5 to -0.1]) with exenatide and -2.1 mmol/mol (-3.7 to -0.6 [-0.2%, -0.3 to -0.1]) with placebo after\n26 weeks (estimated treatment difference of -1.1 mmol/mol (-3.4 to 1.2 [-0.1%, -0.3 to 0.1]; p=0.36). Exenatide increased the number of self-reported gastrointestinal adverse events (primarily nausea [48 events among\n37 patients with exenatide, nine with placebo among 9 patients]). Two serious adverse events occurred in the exenatide group, and six occurred in the placebo group (none were considered to\nbe related to the study drug). INTERPRETATION: Short-acting exenatide does not seem to have a future as a standard add-on treatment to insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes.

We tested whether a urinary proteomic risk classifier (CKD273) score\nwas associated with development of microalbuminuria and whether progression to microalbuminuria could be prevented with the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone. METHODS: In this multicentre, prospective, observational study with embedded randomised\ncontrolled trial (PRIORITY), we recruited people with type 2 diabetes, normal urinary albumin excretion, and preserved renal function from 15 specialist centres in ten European countries. All participants (observational cohort)\nwere tested with the CKD273 classifier and classified as high risk (CKD273 classifier score >0.154) or low risk (</=0.154). Participants who were classified as high risk were entered into a\nrandomised controlled trial and randomly assigned (1:1), by use of an interactive web-response system, to receive spironolactone 25 mg once daily or matched placebo (trial cohort). The primary endpoint was\ndevelopment of confirmed microalbuminuria in all individuals with available data (observational cohort). Secondary endpoints included reduction in incidence of microalbuminuria with spironolactone (trial cohort, intention-to-treat population) and association between CKD273\nrisk score and measures of impaired renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; observational cohort). Adverse events (particularly gynaecomastia and hyperkalaemia) and serious adverse events were recorded for\nthe intention-to-treat population (trial cohort). This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 20120-004523-4) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02040441) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between March 25, 2014, and Sept\n30, 2018, we enrolled and followed-up 1775 participants (observational cohort), 1559 (88%) of 1775 participants had a low-risk urinary proteomic pattern and 216 (12%) had a high-risk pattern, of whom\n209 were included in the trial cohort and assigned to spironolactone (n=102) or placebo (n=107). The overall median follow-up time was 2.51 years (IQR 2.0-3.0). Progression to microalbuminuria was seen\nin 61 (28%) of 216 high-risk participants and 139 (9%) of 1559 low-risk participants (hazard ratio [HR] 2.48, 95% CI 1.80-3.42; p<0.0001, after adjustment for baseline variables of age, sex,\nHbA1c, systolic blood pressure, retinopathy, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR], and eGFR). Development of impaired renal function (eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) was seen in 48 (26%) of 184 high-risk\nparticipants and 119 (8%) of 1423 low-risk participants (HR 3.50; 95% CI 2.50-4.90, after adjustment for baseline variables). A 30% decrease in eGFR from baseline (post-hoc endpoint) was seen in\n42 (19%) of 216 high-risk participants and 62 (4%) of 1559 low-risk participants (HR 5.15, 95% CI 3.41-7.76; p<0.0001, after adjustment for basline eGFR and UACR). In the intention-to-treat trial\ncohort, development of microalbuminuria was seen in 35 (33%) of 107 in the placebo group and 26 (25%) of 102 in the spironolactone group (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49-1.34; p=0.41).\nIn the safety analysis (intention-to-treat trial cohort), events of plasma potassium concentrations of more than 5.5 mmol/L were seen in 13 (13%) of 102 participants in the spironolactone group and\nfour (4%) of 107 participants in the placebo group, and gynaecomastia was seen in three (3%) participants in the spironolactone group and none in the placebo group. One patient died\nin the placebo group due to a cardiac event (considered possibly related to study drug) and one patient died in the spironolactone group due to cancer, deemed unrelated to study\ndrug. INTERPRETATION: In people with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria, a high-risk score from the urinary proteomic classifier CKD273 was associated with an increased risk of progression to microalbuminuria over\na median of 2.5 years, independent of clinical characteristics. However, spironolactone did not prevent progression to microalbuminuria in high-risk patients.

To address this lack of data, we examined gestational diabetes, impaired glucose\ntolerance, and early pregnancy glucose concentrations in relation to fetal growth trajectories. METHODS: This cohort study included 2458 pregnant women from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies-Singletons study, which took place\nbetween 2009 and 2013. Women were recruited from 12 clinical centres in the USA. Women aged 18-40 years without major chronic conditions when entering pregnancy were included and those with\nrecords of neither glucose screening test or glucose tolerance test were excluded from the study. Women were enrolled at gestational weeks 8-13 and randomly assigned to four ultrasonogram schedules (Group\nA; weeks 16, 24, 30, 34; Group B: weeks 18, 26, 31, 35, 39; Group C: weeks 20, 28, 32, 36; Group D: weeks 22, 29, 33, 37, 41) to\ncapture weekly fetal growth. Gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and normal glucose tolerance were defined by medical record review. Glucose was measured in a subsample of women at weeks 10-14.\nWe modelled fetal growth trajectories using linear mixed models with cubic splines. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00912132. FINDINGS: Of the 2458 women included in this study, 107 (4.4%)\nhad gestational diabetes, 118 (4.8%) had impaired glucose tolerance, and 2020 (82.2%) had NGT. 213 women were excluded from the main analysis. The cohort with gestational diabetes was associated with\na larger estimated fetal weight that started at week 20 and was significant at week 28-40 (at week 37: 3061 g [95% CI 2967-3164] for women with gestational diabetes vs\n2943 g [2924-2962] for women with normal glucose tolerance, adjusted p=0.02). In addition, glucose levels at weeks 10-14 were positively associated with estimated fetal weight starting at week 23 and\nthe association became significant at week 27 (at week 37: 3073 g [2983-3167] in the highest tertile vs 2853 g [2755-2955] in the lowest tertile, adjusted p=0.0009. INTERPRETATION: Gestational diabetes\nwas associated with a larger fetal size that started at week 20 and became significant at gestational week 28. Efforts to mitigate gestational diabetes-related fetal overgrowth should start before 24-28\ngestational weeks, when gestational diabetes is typically screened for in the USA.

Although these disorders are not usually considered classic\nmicrovascular complications of diabetes, evidence is growing that microvascular dysfunction is one of the key underlying mechanisms. Microvascular dysfunction is a widespread phenomenon in people with diabetes, including effects on\nthe brain. Cerebral microvascular dysfunction is also apparent in adults with prediabetes, suggesting that cerebral microvascular disease processes start before the onset of diabetes. The microvasculature is involved in the\nregulation of many cerebral processes that when impaired predispose to lacunar and haemorrhagic stroke, cognitive dysfunction, and depression. Main drivers of diabetes-related cerebral microvascular dysfunction are hyperglycaemia, obesity and insulin\nresistance, and hypertension. Increasing amounts of data from observational studies suggest that diabetes-related microvascular dysfunction is associated with a higher risk of stroke, cognitive dysfunction, and depression. Cerebral outcomes in\ndiabetes might be improved following treatments targeting the pathways through which diabetes damages the microcirculation. These treatments might include drugs that reduce dicarbonyl compounds, augment cerebral insulin signalling, or improve\nblood-brain barrier permeability and cerebral vasoreactivity.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32135131", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32135130", "Title": "Gag clause prevents discussion of assisted dying in Victoria, Australia.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

A regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone,\nwith (R-CHOP) or without (CHOP) rituximab is the standard first-line treatment for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are both associated with left ventricular dysfunction. The aim of this\nsystematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the cardiovascular toxicity of this regimen. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to June 3, 2019,\nfor clinical trials and observational studies in adult patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma not otherwise specified)\nthat received first-line treatment with R-CHOP or CHOP. Studies reporting on cardiovascular adverse events and treatment-related cardiovascular mortality were included. Abstracts and articles not written in English were excluded. The\nmain outcomes were the proportion of patients with grade 3-4 cardiovascular adverse events and heart failure. Meta-analyses of one-sample proportions were done in all patients receiving CHOP or R-CHOP. Subgroup\nanalyses on summary estimates were done to determine the effect of number of CHOP or R-CHOP cycles, cycle interval, age, and sex. FINDINGS: Of 2314 identified entries, 137 studies (21\n211 patients) published between April, 1984, and June, 2019 were eligible (9541 patients treated with CHOP, 11 293 patients treated with R-CHOP, 377 both regimens used in the study; median\nfollow-up 39.0 months [IQR 25.5-52.8]). From the included studies, 85 subgroups were treated with CHOP, 76 with R-CHOP, and in four studies both CHOP and R-CHOP were used without a\nsubdivision in separate groups. The pooled proportion for grade 3-4 cardiovascular adverse events, based on 77 studies (n=14 351 patients), was 2.35% (95% CI 1.81-2.93; heterogeneity test Q=326.21; tau(2)=0.0042; I(2)=71.40%;\np<0.0001). For heart failure, the pooled proportion, based on 38 studies (n=5936 patients), was 4.62% (2.25-7.65; heterogeneity test Q=527.33; tau(2)=0.0384; I(2)=95.05%; p<0.0001), with a significant increase in reported heart failure\nfrom 1.64% (95% CI 0.82-2.65) to 11.72% (3.00-24.53) when cardiac function was evaluated post-chemotherapy (p=0.017). 53 (39%) of 137 studies were rated as having high risk of bias for incomplete\noutcome data and 54 (39%) for selective reporting. INTERPRETATION: The considerable increase of reported heart failures with cardiac monitoring, indicates that this complication often remains undiagnosed in patients with non-Hodgkin\nlymphoma who received first-line R-CHOP or CHOP. Our findings are of importance to raise awareness of this complication among clinicians treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and stresses the need for\ncardiac monitoring during and after chemotherapy. Prompt initiation of treatment for heart failure in the presymptomatic phase can mitigate the progression to more advanced heart failure stages.

Because primary vaginal cancer resembles cervical cancer in many aspects, treatment\nstrategies are mainly adopted from evidence in locally advanced cervical cancer. To date, the organ-sparing treatment of choice is definitive radiotherapy, consisting of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy, combined with\nconcurrent chemotherapy. Brachytherapy is an important component of the treatment and its steep dose gradient enables the delivery of high doses of radiation to the primary tumour, while simultaneously sparing\nthe surrounding organs at risk. The introduction of volumetric CT or MRI image-guided adaptive brachytherapy in cervical cancer has led to better pelvic control and survival, with decreased morbidity, than\nbrachytherapy based on x-ray radiographs. MRI-based image-guided adaptive brachytherapy with superior soft-tissue contrast has also been adopted sporadically for primary vaginal cancer.

This estimate, in conjunction with the findings that pancreatic\nductal adenocarcinoma incidence is rising and that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has the highest case-fatality rate of any solid tumour, highlights the urgency for designing novel therapeutic strategies to combat this\ndeadly disease. Through the efforts of the global research community, our knowledge of the factors that lead to the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, its progression, and the interplay between\ntumour cells and their surrounding microenvironment have improved substantially. Although these scientific advances have not yet translated into targeted or immunotherapy strategies that are effective for most patients with pancreatic\nductal adenocarcinoma, important incremental progress has been made particularly for the treatment of specific molecular subgroups of tumours. Although PD-1 inhibitors for mismatch-repair-deficient tumours and NTRK inhibitors for tumours containing\nNTRK gene fusions are the most recent targeted agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, olaparib for germline BRCA-mutated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is expected to be approved soon\nin the maintenance setting. These recent advances show the accelerated pace at which pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma drugs are achieving successful clinical outcomes. Here we review the current understanding of the\npathophysiology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, recent advances in the understanding of the stromal microenvironment, current standard-of-care treatment, and novel therapeutic targets and strategies that hold promise for improving patient outcomes.\nWe predict that there will be major breakthroughs in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the next 5-10 years. These breakthroughs will result from the increased understanding of the\ntreatment barriers imposed by the tumour-associated stroma, and from the development of novel approaches to re-engineer the tumour microenvironment in favour of effective anticancer responses.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32135117", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32135116", "Title": "Correction to Lancet Oncol 2016; 17: 287-98.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

The Know Your Tumor (KYT) programme includes US patients with pancreatic cancer and enables patients to undergo commercially available multi-omic profiling to provide molecularly tailored therapy options and clinical\ntrial recommendations. We sought to determine whether patients with pancreatic cancer whose tumours harboured such actionable molecular alterations and who received molecularly matched therapy had a longer median overall survival\nthan similar patients who did not receive molecularly matched therapy. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, treatment history and longitudinal survival outcomes were analysed in patients aged 18 years or older\nwith biopsy-confirmed pancreatic cancer of any stage, enrolled in the KYT programme and who received molecular testing results. Since the timing of KYT enrolment varied for each patient, the primary\noutcome measurement of median overall survival was calculated from the initial diagnosis of advanced disease until death. We compared median overall survival in patients with actionable mutations who were treated\nwith a matched therapy versus those who were not treated with a matched therapy. FINDINGS: Of 1856 patients with pancreatic cancer who were referred to the KYT programme between June\n16, 2014, and March 31, 2019, 1082 (58%) patients received personalised reports based on their molecular testing results. Actionable molecular alterations were identified in 282 (26%) of 1082 samples. Among\n677 patients for whom outcomes were available, 189 had actionable molecular alterations. With a median follow-up of 383 days (IQR 214-588), those patients with actionable molecular alterations who received a\nmatched therapy (n=46) had significantly longer median overall survival than did those patients who only received unmatched therapies (n=143; 2.58 years [95% CI 2.39 to not reached] vs 1.51 years\n[1.33-1.87]; hazard ratio 0.42 [95% CI 0.26-0.68], p=0.0004). The 46 patients who received a matched therapy also had significantly longer overall survival than the 488 patients who did not have\nan actionable molecular alteration (2.58 years [95% CI 2.39 to not reached] vs 1.32 years [1.25-1.47]; HR 0.34 [95% CI 0.22-0.53], p<0.0001). However, median overall survival did not differ between\nthe patients who received unmatched therapy and those without an actionable molecular alteration (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.64-1.04], p=0.10). INTERPRETATION: These real-world outcomes suggest that the adoption of precision medicine\ncan have a substantial effect on survival in patients with pancreatic cancer, and that molecularly guided treatments targeting oncogenic drivers and the DNA damage response and repair pathway warrant further\nprospective evaluation.

Our mutational analysis indicates\nroles for different olfactory receptors in long- and short-range attraction to noni, and our cross-species allele-transfer experiments demonstrate that the tuning of one of these receptors is important for species-specific\nhost-seeking. We identify the molecular determinants of this functional change, and characterize their evolutionary origin and behavioural importance. We perform circuit tracing in the D. sechellia brain, and find that\nreceptor adaptations are accompanied by increased sensory pooling onto interneurons as well as species-specific central projection patterns. This work reveals an accumulation of molecular, physiological and anatomical traits that are\nlinked to behavioural divergence between species, and defines a model for investigating speciation and the evolution of the nervous system.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32132713", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32132712", "Title": "Wafer-scale single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride monolayers on Cu (111).", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/07 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting layered materials offer great potential for extending Moore's law of the number of transistors in an integrated circuit(1). One key challenge with 2D semiconductors is to\navoid the formation of charge scattering and trap sites from adjacent dielectrics. An insulating van der Waals layer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provides an excellent interface dielectric, efficiently reducing\ncharge scattering(2,3). Recent studies have shown the growth of single-crystal hBN films on molten gold surfaces(4) or bulk copper foils(5). However, the use of molten gold is not favoured by\nindustry, owing to its high cost, cross-contamination and potential issues of process control and scalability. Copper foils might be suitable for roll-to-roll processes, but are unlikely to be compatible with\nadvanced microelectronic fabrication on wafers. Thus, a reliable way of growing single-crystal hBN films directly on wafers would contribute to the broad adoption of 2D layered materials in industry. Previous\nattempts to grow hBN monolayers on Cu (111) metals have failed to achieve mono-orientation, resulting in unwanted grain boundaries when the layers merge into films(6,7). Growing single-crystal hBN on such\nhigh-symmetry surface planes as Cu (111)(5,8) is widely believed to be impossible, even in theory. Nonetheless, here we report the successful epitaxial growth of single-crystal hBN monolayers on a Cu\n(111) thin film across a two-inch c-plane sapphire wafer. This surprising result is corroborated by our first-principles calculations, suggesting that the epitaxial growth is enhanced by lateral docking of hBN\nto Cu (111) steps, ensuring the mono-orientation of hBN monolayers. The obtained single-crystal hBN, incorporated as an interface layer between molybdenum disulfide and hafnium dioxide in a bottom-gate configuration, enhanced\nthe electrical performance of transistors.

However, the nature of the DNA damage\ninduced by acetaldehyde and how this is repaired remains a key question. Here we generate acetaldehyde-induced DNA interstrand crosslinks and determine their repair mechanism in Xenopus egg extracts. We find\nthat two replication-coupled pathways repair these lesions. The first is the FA pathway, which operates using excision-analogous to the mechanism used to repair the interstrand crosslinks caused by the chemotherapeutic\nagent cisplatin. However, the repair of acetaldehyde-induced crosslinks results in increased mutation frequency and an altered mutational spectrum compared with the repair of cisplatin-induced crosslinks. The second repair mechanism requires\nreplication fork convergence, but does not involve DNA incisions-instead the acetaldehyde crosslink itself is broken. The Y-family DNA polymerase REV1 completes repair of the crosslink, culminating in a distinct mutational\nspectrum.

The carbon sink in live aboveground biomass in intact African tropical forests\nhas been stable for the three decades to 2015, at 0.66 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.53-0.79), in contrast to the long-term decline\nin Amazonian forests(6).

The difference is largely driven by carbon losses from tree mortality, with\nno detectable multi-decadal trend in Africa and a long-term increase in Amazonia. Both continents show increasing tree growth, consistent with the expected net effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and\nair temperature(7-9). Despite the past stability of the African carbon sink, our most intensively monitored plots suggest a post-2010 increase in carbon losses, delayed compared to Amazonia, indicating asynchronous carbon\nsink saturation on the two continents. A statistical model including carbon dioxide, temperature, drought and forest dynamics accounts for the observed trends and indicates a long-term future decline in the\nAfrican sink, whereas the Amazonian sink continues to weaken rapidly.

Here we provide evidence that\nthe pure ferromagnetic Kondo lattice(9,10) CeRh6Ge4 becomes a strange metal at a pressure-induced QCP. Measurements of the specific heat and resistivity under pressure demonstrate that the ferromagnetic transition is continuously\nsuppressed to zero temperature, revealing a strange-metal behaviour around the QCP.

United States, and to conduct a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. DESIGN:\nProspective cohort study, and a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. SETTING: Nurses' Health Study (NHS, 1980-2012), NHS II (1991-2013), Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study (HPFS, 1986-2012). PARTICIPANTS: Cohort\nanalyses included 83 349 women from NHS, 90 214 women from NHS II, and 42 055 men from HPFS who were free of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer\nat baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident cardiovascular disease, which included non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, and stroke. RESULTS: Over up to 32 years of follow-up (>5.54 million person\nyears), 14 806 participants with incident cardiovascular disease were identified in the three cohorts. Participants with a higher egg intake had a higher body mass index, were less likely to\nbe treated with statins, and consumed more red meats. Most people consumed between one and less than five eggs per week. In the pooled multivariable analysis, consumption of at least\none egg per day was not associated with incident cardiovascular disease risk after adjustment for updated lifestyle and dietary factors associated with egg intake (hazard ratio for at least one\negg per day v less than one egg per month 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.05). In the updated meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies (33 risk estimates, 1 720\n108 participants, 139 195 cardiovascular disease events), an increase of one egg per day was not associated with cardiovascular disease risk (pooled relative risk 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to\n1.03, I(2)=62.3%). Results were similar for coronary heart disease (21 risk estimates, 1 411 261 participants, 59 713 coronary heart disease events; 0.96, 0.91 to 1.03, I(2)=38.2%), and stroke (22\nrisk estimates, 1 059 315 participants, 53 617 stroke events; 0.99, 0.91 to 1.07, I(2)=71.5%). In analyses stratified by geographical location (P for interaction=0.07), no association was found between egg\nconsumption and cardiovascular disease risk among US cohorts (1.01, 0.96 to 1.06, I(2)=30.8%) or European cohorts (1.05, 0.92 to 1.19, I(2)=64.7%), but an inverse association was seen in Asian cohorts\n(0.92, 0.85 to 0.99, I(2)=44.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Results from the three cohorts and from the updated meta-analysis show that moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated\nwith cardiovascular disease risk overall, and is associated with potentially lower cardiovascular disease risk in Asian populations.

DESIGN: Observational evaluation. SETTING: Veterans Health\nAdministration. PARTICIPANTS: 1 394 102 patients in the Veterans Health Administration with an outpatient prescription for an opioid analgesic from fiscal year 2013 to the end of fiscal year 2014\n(1 October 2012 to 30 September 2014). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A multivariable Cox non-proportional hazards regression model examined death from overdose or suicide, with the interaction of time varying opioid\ncessation by length of treatment (</=30, 31-90, 91-400, and >400 days) as the main covariates. Stopping treatment with opioids was measured as the time when a patient was estimated to\nhave no prescription for opioids, up to the end of the next fiscal year (2014) or the patient's death. RESULTS: 2887 deaths from overdose or suicide were found. The incidence\nof stopping opioid treatment was 57.4% (n=799 668) overall, and based on length of opioid treatment was 32.0% (</=30 days), 8.7% (31-90 days), 22.7% (91-400 days), and 36.6% (>400 days).\nThe interaction between stopping treatment with opioids and length of treatment was significant (P<0.001); stopping treatment was associated with an increased risk of death from overdose or suicide regardless of\nthe length of treatment, with the risk increasing the longer patients were treated. Hazard ratios for patients who stopped opioid treatment (with reference values for all other covariates) were 1.67\n(</=30 days), 2.80 (31-90 days), 3.95 (91-400 days), and 6.77 (>400 days). Descriptive life table data suggested that death rates for overdose or suicide increased immediately after starting or stopping\ntreatment with opioids, with the incidence decreasing over about three to 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients were at greater risk of death from overdose or suicide after stopping opioid treatment, with\nan increase in the risk the longer patients had been treated before stopping. Descriptive data suggested that starting treatment with opioids was also a risk period. Strategies to mitigate the\nrisk in these periods are not currently a focus of guidelines for long term use of opioids. The associations observed cannot be assumed to be causal; the context in which\nopioid prescriptions were started and stopped might contribute to risk and was not investigated. Safer prescribing of opioids should take a broader view on patient safety and mitigate the risk\nfrom the patient's perspective.

from $314 million to $2.8 billion. Objective: To estimate the research\nand development investment required to bring a new therapeutic agent to market, using publicly available data. Design and Setting: Data were analyzed on new therapeutic agents approved by the US\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2009 and 2018 to estimate the research and development expenditure required to bring a new medicine to market. Data were accessed from the US\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, Drugs@FDA database, and ClinicalTrials.gov, alongside published data on clinical trial success rates. Exposures: Conduct of preclinical and clinical studies of new therapeutic agents. Main Outcomes and\nMeasures: Median and mean research and development spending on new therapeutic agents approved by the FDA, capitalized at a real cost of capital rate (the required rate of return for\nan investor) of 10.5% per year, with bootstrapped CIs. All amounts were reported in 2018 US dollars. Results: The FDA approved 355 new drugs and biologics over the study period.\nResearch and development expenditures were available for 63 (18%) products, developed by 47 different companies. After accounting for the costs of failed trials, the median capitalized research and development investment\nto bring a new drug to market was estimated at $985.3 million (95% CI, $683.6 million-$1228.9 million), and the mean investment was estimated at $1335.9 million (95% CI, $1042.5 million-$1637.5\nmillion) in the base case analysis. Median estimates by therapeutic area (for areas with >/=5 drugs) ranged from $765.9 million (95% CI, $323.0 million-$1473.5 million) for nervous system agents to\n$2771.6 million (95% CI, $2051.8 million-$5366.2 million) for antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents. Data were mainly accessible for smaller firms, orphan drugs, products in certain therapeutic areas, first-in-class drugs, therapeutic agents\nthat received accelerated approval, and products approved between 2014 and 2018. Results varied in sensitivity analyses using different estimates of clinical trial success rates, preclinical expenditures, and cost of capital.\nConclusions and Relevance: This study provides an estimate of research and development costs for new therapeutic agents based on publicly available data.

Objective:\nTo describe changes in list prices, net prices, and discounts for branded pharmaceutical products for which US sales are reported by publicly traded companies, and to determine the extent to\nwhich list price increases were offset by increases in discounts. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective descriptive study using 2007-2018 pricing data from the investment firm SSR Health for branded products\navailable before January 2007 with US sales reported by publicly traded companies (n = 602 drugs). Net prices were estimated by compiling company-reported sales for each product and number of\nunits sold in the US. Exposures: Calendar year. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included list and net prices and discounts in Medicaid and other payers. List prices represent manufacturers' price\nto wholesalers or direct purchasers but do not account for discounts. Net prices represent revenue per unit of the product after all manufacturer concessions are accounted for (including rebates, coupon\ncards, and any other discount). Means of outcomes were calculated each year for the overall sample and 6 therapeutic classes, weighting each product by utilization and adjusting for inflation. Results:\nFrom 2007 to 2018, list prices increased by 159% (95% CI, 137%-181%), or 9.1% per year, while net prices increased by 60% (95% CI, 36%-84%), or 4.5% per year, with\nstable net prices between 2015 and 2018. Discounts increased from 40% to 76% in Medicaid and from 23% to 51% for other payers. Increases in discounts offset 62% of list\nprice increases. There was large variability across classes. Multiple sclerosis treatments (n = 4) had the greatest increases in list (439%) and net (157%) prices. List prices of lipid-lowering agents\n(n = 11) increased by 278% and net prices by 95%. List prices of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (n = 3) increased by 166% and net prices by 73%. List\nprices of insulins (n = 7) increased by 262%, and net prices by 51%. List prices of noninsulin antidiabetic agents (n = 10) increased by 165%, and net prices decreased\nby 1%. List price increases were lowest (59%) for antineoplastic agents (n = 44), but discounts only offset 41% of list price increases, leading to 35% increase in net prices.\nConclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of branded drugs in the US from 2007 to 2018, mean increases in list and net prices were substantial, although discounts offset an estimated\n62% of list price increases with substantial variation across classes.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125403", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32125402", "Title": "US Health Care Spending by Payer and Health Condition, 1996-2016.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/04 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 3", "Abstract": "Importance: US health care spending has continued to increase and now accounts for 18% of the US economy, although little is known about how spending on each health condition varies\nby payer, and how these amounts have changed over time. Objective: To estimate US spending on health care according to 3 types of payers (public insurance [including Medicare, Medicaid, and\nother government programs], private insurance, or out-of-pocket payments) and by health condition, age group, sex, and type of care for 1996 through 2016. Design and Setting: Government budgets, insurance claims,\nfacility records, household surveys, and official US records from 1996 through 2016 were collected to estimate spending for 154 health conditions. Spending growth rates (standardized by population size and age\ngroup) were calculated for each type of payer and health condition. Exposures: Ambulatory care, inpatient care, nursing care facility stay, emergency department care, dental care, and purchase of prescribed pharmaceuticals\nin a retail setting. Main Outcomes and Measures: National spending estimates stratified by health condition, age group, sex, type of care, and type of payer and modeled for each year\nfrom 1996 through 2016. Results: Total health care spending increased from an estimated $1.4 trillion in 1996 (13.3% of gross domestic product [GDP]; $5259 per person) to an estimated $3.1\ntrillion in 2016 (17.9% of GDP; $9655 per person); 85.2% of that spending was included in this study. In 2016, an estimated 48.0% (95% CI, 48.0%-48.0%) of health care spending\nwas paid by private insurance, 42.6% (95% CI, 42.5%-42.6%) by public insurance, and 9.4% (95% CI, 9.4%-9.4%) by out-of-pocket payments. In 2016, among the 154 conditions, low back and neck\npain had the highest amount of health care spending with an estimated $134.5 billion (95% CI, $122.4-$146.9 billion) in spending, of which 57.2% (95% CI, 52.2%-61.2%) was paid by private\ninsurance, 33.7% (95% CI, 30.0%-38.4%) by public insurance, and 9.2% (95% CI, 8.3%-10.4%) by out-of-pocket payments. Other musculoskeletal disorders accounted for the second highest amount of health care spending (estimated\nat $129.8 billion [95% CI, $116.3-$149.7 billion]) and most had private insurance (56.4% [95% CI, 52.6%-59.3%]). Diabetes accounted for the third highest amount of the health care spending (estimated at\n$111.2 billion [95% CI, $105.7-$115.9 billion]) and most had public insurance (49.8% [95% CI, 44.4%-56.0%]). Other conditions estimated to have substantial health care spending in 2016 were ischemic heart disease\n($89.3 billion [95% CI, $81.1-$95.5 billion]), falls ($87.4 billion [95% CI, $75.0-$100.1 billion]), urinary diseases ($86.0 billion [95% CI, $76.3-$95.9 billion]), skin and subcutaneous diseases ($85.0 billion [95% CI, $80.5-$90.2\nbillion]), osteoarthritis ($80.0 billion [95% CI, $72.2-$86.1 billion]), dementias ($79.2 billion [95% CI, $67.6-$90.8 billion]), and hypertension ($79.0 billion [95% CI, $72.6-$86.8 billion]). The conditions with the highest spending varied\nby type of payer, age, sex, type of care, and year. After adjusting for changes in inflation, population size, and age groups, public insurance spending was estimated to have increased\nat an annualized rate of 2.9% (95% CI, 2.9%-2.9%); private insurance, 2.6% (95% CI, 2.6%-2.6%); and out-of-pocket payments, 1.1% (95% CI, 1.0%-1.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: Estimates of US spending on\nhealth care showed substantial increases from 1996 through 2016, with the highest increases in population-adjusted spending by public insurance. Although spending on low back and neck pain, other musculoskeletal disorders,\nand diabetes accounted for the highest amounts of spending, the payers and the rates of change in annual spending growth rates varied considerably.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125402", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32125401", "Title": "Profitability of Large Pharmaceutical Companies Compared With Other Large Public Companies.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/04 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 3", "Abstract": "Importance: Understanding the profitability of pharmaceutical companies is essential to formulating evidence-based policies to reduce drug costs while maintaining the industry's ability to innovate and provide essential medicines. Objective: To\ncompare the profitability of large pharmaceutical companies with other large companies. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study compared the annual profits of 35 large pharmaceutical companies with 357 companies\nin the S&P 500 Index from 2000 to 2018 using information from annual financial reports. A statistically significant differential profit margin favoring pharmaceutical companies was evidence of greater profitability. Exposures:\nLarge pharmaceutical vs nonpharmaceutical companies. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were revenue and 3 measures of annual profit: gross profit (revenue minus the cost of goods sold); earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA; pretax profit from core business activities); and net income, also referred to as earnings (difference between all revenues and expenses). Profit measures are\ndescribed as cumulative for all companies from 2000 to 2018 or annual profit as a fraction of revenue (margin). Results: From 2000 to 2018, 35 large pharmaceutical companies reported cumulative\nrevenue of $11.5 trillion, gross profit of $8.6 trillion, EBITDA of $3.7 trillion, and net income of $1.9 trillion, while 357 S&P 500 companies reported cumulative revenue of $130.5 trillion,\ngross profit of $42.1 trillion, EBITDA of $22.8 trillion, and net income of $9.4 trillion. In bivariable regression models, the median annual profit margins of pharmaceutical companies were significantly greater\nthan those of S&P 500 companies (gross profit margin: 76.5% vs 37.4%; difference, 39.1% [95% CI, 32.5%-45.7%]; P < .001; EBITDA margin: 29.4% vs 19%; difference, 10.4% [95% CI, 7.1%-13.7%];\nP < .001; net income margin: 13.8% vs 7.7%; difference, 6.1% [95% CI, 2.5%-9.7%]; P < .001). The differences were smaller in regression models controlling for company size and year\nand when considering only companies reporting research and development expense (gross profit margin: difference, 30.5% [95% CI, 20.9%-40.1%]; P < .001; EBITDA margin: difference, 9.2% [95% CI, 5.2%-13.2%]; P <\n.001; net income margin: difference, 3.6% [95% CI, 0.011%-7.2%]; P = .05). Conclusions and Relevance: From 2000 to 2018, the profitability of large pharmaceutical companies was significantly greater than other\nlarge, public companies, but the difference was less pronounced when considering company size, year, or research and development expense.

"2020/03/21 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "Large-scale energy storage is becoming increasingly critical to balancing renewable energy production and consumption(1). Organic redox flow batteries, made from inexpensive and sustainable redox-active materials, are promising storage technologies that\nare cheaper and less environmentally hazardous than vanadium-based batteries, but they have shorter lifetimes and lower energy density(2,3). Thus, fundamental insight at the molecular level is required to improve performance(4,5).\nHere we report two in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods of studying redox flow batteries, which are applied to two redox-active electrolytes: 2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) and 4,4'-((9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-diyl)dioxy) dibutyrate (DBEAQ). In\nthe first method, we monitor the changes in the (1)H NMR shift of the liquid electrolyte as it flows out of the electrochemical cell. In the second method, we observe\nthe changes that occur simultaneously in the positive and negative electrodes in the full electrochemical cell. Using the bulk magnetization changes (observed via the (1)H NMR shift of the water\nresonance) and the line broadening of the (1)H shifts of the quinone resonances as a function of the state of charge, we measure the potential differences of the two single-electron\ncouples, identify and quantify the rate of electron transfer between the reduced and oxidized species, and determine the extent of electron delocalization of the unpaired spins over the radical anions.\nThese NMR techniques enable electrolyte decomposition and battery self-discharge to be explored in real time, and show that DHAQ is decomposed electrochemically via a reaction that can be minimized by\nlimiting the voltage used on charging. We foresee applications of these NMR methods in understanding a wide range of redox processes in flow and other electrochemical systems.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123353", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32123352", "Title": "Nagaoka ferromagnetism observed in a quantum dot plaquette.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/04 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "Engineered, highly controllable quantum systems are promising simulators of emergent physics beyond the simulation capabilities of classical computers(1). An important problem in many-body physics is itinerant magnetism, which originates purely\nfrom long-range interactions of free electrons and whose existence in real systems has been debated for decades(2,3). Here we use a quantum simulator consisting of a four-electron-site square plaquette of\nquantum dots(4) to demonstrate Nagaoka ferromagnetism(5). This form of itinerant magnetism has been rigorously studied theoretically(6-9) but has remained unattainable in experiments. We load the plaquette with three electrons and\ndemonstrate the predicted emergence of spontaneous ferromagnetic correlations through pairwise measurements of spin. We find that the ferromagnetic ground state is remarkably robust to engineered disorder in the on-site potentials\nand we can induce a transition to the low-spin state by changing the plaquette topology to an open chain. This demonstration of Nagaoka ferromagnetism highlights that quantum simulators can be\nused to study physical phenomena that have not yet been observed in any experimental system. The work also constitutes an important step towards large-scale quantum dot simulators of correlated electron\nsystems.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123352", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32122934", "Title": "Clinical negligence costs: taking action to safeguard NHS sustainability.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/13 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122934", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32122933", "Title": "Summit on drug deaths ends with no agreement.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/04 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122933", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32122886", "Title": "Medically assisted dying: Canada tables legislation to broaden accessibility criteria.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/04 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122886", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32122883", "Title": "Coroner to ask GMC to check vulnerability of doctors it investigates.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/04 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122883", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32122882", "Title": "Current and future treatments for tuberculosis.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/13 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 2", "Abstract": "Guidelines on the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) have essentially remained the same for the past 35 years, but are now starting to change.

One early clinical manifestation of progeria is abnormal skeletal growth, yet this growth has not\nbeen fully characterised. We aimed to characterise the skeletal maturation and long-bone growth patterns of patients with the clinical phenotype of progeria. METHODS: For this retrospective study, we reviewed skeletal\nsurveys of patients (aged <20 years) with progeria obtained over a 9.5-year period. Most surveys included radiographs of the hands and long bones (humeri, radii, ulnas, tibias, and fibulas). Bone\nages of these patients were estimated by the standards of Greulich and Pyle. Following the established methods for studying long-bone growth, the study cohort was separated into two overlapping age\ngroups: longitudinal bone length measurements were made between physes for the childhood group (aged 12 years or younger) and from the upper margins of the proximal to the lower margin\nof the distal ossified epiphyses for the adolescent group (aged 10 years or older). Bone age estimates and bone length measurements were plotted against the chronological age of patients and\ncompared with reference standards. Statistical analyses were based on mixed models. FINDINGS: 85 patients with progeria and 250 skeletal surveys were included in our study. For both sexes, bone age\nestimates showed a more advanced skeletal maturation rate throughout all chronological ages than the normal rate of 1 (p<0.0001), with the rate of maturation being 1.09 (SE 0.02) for boys\nand 1.14 (0.02) for girls. Longitudinal long-bone lengths began to deviate from normal standards by age 1-2 years. Growth curves for these long bones plateaued at about half the normal\neventual bone length, and the half-life (the time taken to grow to half the eventual bone length) was also about half the time compared with normal standards. INTERPRETATION: Our study\nestablished growth curves that might serve as reference standards for skeletal maturation and long-bone growth of patients with the clinical phenotype of progeria.

New direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are available. Objective: To update the 2013 review on HCV screening to inform\nthe USPSTF. Data Sources: Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through February 2019, with surveillance through September 2019. Study Selection:\nRandomized clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized treatment studies of HCV screening and DAA therapy; cohort studies on screening, antiviral therapy, and the association between an SVR after antiviral therapy and\nclinical outcomes. Data Extraction and Synthesis: One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality, morbidity, quality of life, screening\nand treatment harms, and screening diagnostic yield. Results: Eight RCTs of DAA therapy vs placebo or an outdated antiviral regimen, 48 other treatment studies, and 33 cohort studies, with a\ntotal of 179230 participants, were included. No study evaluated effects of HCV screening vs no screening. One new study since the 2013 review (n = 5917) found similar diagnostic yield\nof risk-based screening (sensitivity, 82%; number needed to screen to identify 1 HCV case, 15) and birth cohort screening (sensitivity, 76%; number needed to screen, 29), assuming perfect implementation. Ten\nopen-label studies (n = 3292) reported small improvements in some quality-of-life and functional outcomes (eg, less than 3 points on the 0 to 100 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical\nand mental component summary scales) after DAA treatment compared with before treatment. Two cohort studies (n = 24686) found inconsistent associations of antiviral therapy vs no therapy with risk of\nhepatocellular carcinoma. Forty-nine treatment studies (n = 10181) found DAA regimens associated with pooled SVR rates greater than 95% across genotypes, and low short-term rates of serious adverse events (1.9%)\nand withdrawal due to adverse events (0.4%). An SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with decreased adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (13 studies, n = 36986; pooled hazard ratio [HR],\n0.40 [95% CI, 0.28-0.56) and hepatocellular carcinoma (20 studies, n = 84491; pooled HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.38]) vs no SVR. Conclusions and Relevance: Direct evidence on the\neffects of HCV screening on clinical outcomes remains unavailable, but DAA regimens were associated with SVR rates greater than 5% and few short-term harms relative to older antiviral therapies.

We aimed to\ndetermine the effects on mental health of the introduction of Universal Credit. METHODS: In this longitudinal controlled study, we linked 197 111 observations from 52 187 individuals of working age\n(16-64 years) in England, Wales, and Scotland who participated in the Understanding Society UK Longitudinal Household Panel Study between 2009 and 2018 with administrative data on the month when Universal\nCredit was introduced into the area in which each respondent lived. We included participants who had data on employment status, local authority area of residence, psychological distress, and confounding variables.\nWe excluded individuals from Northern Ireland and people out of work with a disability. We used difference-in-differences analysis of this nationally representative, longitudinal, household survey and separated respondents into two\ngroups: unemployed people who were eligible for Universal Credit (intervention group) and people who were not unemployed and therefore would not have generally been eligible for Universal Credit (comparison group).\nUsing the phased roll-out of Universal Credit, we compared the change in psychological distress (self-reported via General Health Questionnaire-12) between the intervention group and the comparison group over time as\nthe reform was introduced in the area in which each respondent lived. We defined clinically significant psychological distress as a score of greater than 3 on the General Health Questionnaire-12.\nWe tested whether there were differential effects across subgroups (age, sex, and education). FINDINGS: The prevalence of psychological distress increased in the intervention group by 6.57 percentage points (95% CI\n1.69-11.42) after the introduction of Universal Credit relative to the comparison group, after accounting for potential confounders. We estimate that between April 29, 2013, and Dec 31, 2018, an additional\n63 674 (95% CI 10 042-117 307) unemployed people will have experienced levels of psychological distress that are clinically significant due to the introduction of Universal Credit; 21 760 of\nthese individuals might reach the diagnostic threshold for depression. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the introduction of Universal Credit led to an increase in psychological distress, a measure of mental\nhealth difficulties, among those affected by the policy. Future changes to government welfare systems should be evaluated not only on a fiscal basis but on their potential to affect health\nand wellbeing.

Screening for diabetic retinopathy is essential\nto detect referable cases that need timely full ophthalmic examination and treatment to avoid permanent visual loss. In the past few years, personalised screening intervals that take into account several\nrisk factors have been proposed, with good cost-effectiveness ratios. However, resources for nationwide screening programmes are scarce in many countries. New technologies, such as scanning confocal ophthalmology with ultrawide field\nimaging and handheld mobile devices, teleophthalmology for remote grading, and artificial intelligence for automated detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy, are changing screening strategies and improving cost-effectiveness. Additionally, emerging evidence\nsuggests that retinal imaging could be useful for identifying individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease or cognitive impairment, which could expand the role of diabetic retinopathy screening beyond the prevention\nof sight-threatening disease.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32113513", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32113510", "Title": "Convalescent plasma as a potential therapy for COVID-19.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

This study aimed to assess the antitumour activity and safety of the\nanti-PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab in pretreated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This is a multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, phase 2 trial done at 13 study sites in China. Eligible patients\nwere aged 18 years and older with a histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, had progressed on or were intolerant to previous systemic treatment, and had an Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive camrelizumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 or 3 weeks, via a centralised interactive web-response system using\nblock randomisation (block size of four). The primary endpoints were objective response (per blinded independent central review) and 6-month overall survival, in all randomly assigned patients who had at least\none dose of study treatment. Safety was analysed in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02989922, and follow-up is ongoing, but enrolment is closed. FINDINGS: Between\nNov 15, 2016, and Nov 16, 2017, 303 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 220 eligible patients were randomly assigned and among whom 217 received camrelizumab (109 patients were\ngiven treatment every 2 weeks and 108 every 3 weeks). Median follow-up was 12.5 months (IQR 5.7-15.5). Objective response was reported in 32 (14.7%; 95% CI 10.3-20.2) of 217 patients.\nThe overall survival probability at 6 months was 74.4% (95% CI 68.0-79.7)]. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 47 (22%) of 217 patients; the most common were\nincreased aspartate aminotransferase (ten [5%]) and decreased neutrophil count (seven [3%]). Two deaths were judged by the investigators to be potentially treatment-related (one due to liver dysfunction and one due\nto multiple organ failure).

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy can prolong progression-free\nsurvival in these patients. Additional treatment of liver disease might further improve outcomes. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of additional holmium-166 ((166)Ho) radioembolisation after peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy in patients with metastatic liver neuroendocrine neoplasms. METHODS: The Holmium Embolization Particles for Arterial Radiotherapy Plus (177)Lu-Dotatate in Salvage Neuroendocrine Tumour Patients (HEPAR PLuS) study was a single-centre, phase\n2 study done at the University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, Netherlands). Patients, aged at least 18 years, with histologically proven grade 1 or 2 neuroendocrine neoplasms of all origins, an\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and three or more measurable liver metastases according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria received (166)Ho-radioembolisation within\n20 weeks after four cycles of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (lutetium-177-dotatate [(177)Lu-dotatate]). The primary endpoint was objective liver tumour response in the treated liver volume, defined as complete response (disappearance\nof all lesions) or partial response (>/=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions, compared with baseline measurements), according to RECIST 1.1, analysed per protocol\nat 3 months. Safety was assessed in all patients who received treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02067988. Recruitment is completed and long-term follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: From Oct\n15, 2014, to Sept 12, 2018, 34 patients were assessed for eligibility. 31 patients received treatment and 30 (97%) patients were available for primary endpoint assessment and completed 6 months\nof follow-up. Three (9%) patients were excluded at screening and one (3%) patient was treated and died before the primary endpoint and was replaced. According to the per-protocol analysis 13\n(43%; 95% CI 26-63) of 30 patients achieved an objective response in the treated volume. The most frequently reported Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3-4 clinical and\nlaboratory toxicities within 6 months included abdominal pain (three [10%] of 31 patients), increased gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (16 [54%]), and lymphocytopenia (seven [23%]). One (3%) fatal treatment-related serious adverse event occurred\n(radioembolisation-induced liver disease). Two (6%) patients had serious adverse events deemed to be unrelated to treatment (gastric ulcer and perforated cholecystitis). INTERPRETATION: (166)Ho-radioembolisation, as an adjunct to peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasm liver metastases, is safe and efficacious. Radioembolisation can be considered in patients with bulky liver disease, including after peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.

Haematology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/01 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 26", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inherited quantitative (type I) deficiency of plasma antithrombin is associated with a high risk of venous thromboembolism, which further increases in pregnancy. Inherited thrombophilia also increases the risk of\nobstetrical complications, but data on maternal and fetal outcomes in women with antithrombin deficiency are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism\nand obstetrical complications in women with type I antithrombin deficiency. METHODS: In this single-centre, retrospective cohort study, women who had been referred to our Hemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Milan, Italy\nfor a thrombophilia work-up from Jan 1, 1980, to Jan 1, 2018, with type I antithrombin deficiency and who had had at least one pregnancy were included. Women with type\nII anthithrombin deficiency were excluded from the study. Data on pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism, pregnancy outcomes, and the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) were collected to evaluate the risk of pregnancy-associated\nvenous thromboembolism and obstetrical complications with or without use of LMWH. FINDINGS: 126 women had been referred to the hospital, of whom 88 (70%) had had at least one pregnancy.\nEight were excluded because of referral for venous thromboembolism during pregnancy or the puerperium, resulting in 80 (63%)women evaluated for the risk of venous thromboembolism. One woman was excluded because\nof referral for obstetrical complications, resulting in 87 (69%) evaluated for risk of obstetrical complications. We observed three events of venous thromboembolism in 43 pregnancies in women treated with LMWH\n(7.0%, 95% CI 1.8-17.8), and 17 events in 146 pregnancies in women who did not receive LMWH (11.6%, 7.2-17.6; relative risk [RR] 0.6, 95% CI 0.2-1.9; p=0.57). The risk of\nvenous thromboembolism without LMWH was 5.4% (95% CI 0.9-16.7) in women with a negative family history of venous thromboembolism, and 11.8% (6.4-19.6) in those with a positive family history of\nvenous thromboembolism. Of the 87 women evaluated for the risk of obstetrical complications, miscarriages occurred in 6 (13%) of 45 pregnant women treated with LMWH and 32 (20%) of 161\nwomen who did not receive LMWH (terminations excluded). Late obstetrical complications occurred in 11 (24%) of women treated with LMWH and nine (6%) in those who did not receive LMWH\n(RR 4.4, 95% CI 1.9-9.9; p=0.0006). INTERPRETATION: Our results confirm that women with type I antithrombin deficiency have a high risk of first or recurrent venous thromboembolism during pregnancy. The\nrisk of venous thromboembolism is highest in women with a positive family history of the condition, but still relevant in those with a negative family history, suggesting that LMWH prophylaxis\nshould also be considered in these patients.

However, to harness this technology, technical and societal challenges must be overcome. Large CT datasets will be needed to power the training of deep learning algorithms. Open science\nresearch and collaboration between academia and industry must be encouraged. Prospective clinical utility studies will be needed to test computer algorithm performance in real-world clinical settings and demonstrate patient benefit\nover current best practice.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy\nof gefapixant compared with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment for refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough. METHODS: We did a 12-week, phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in\npatients with refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough aged 18-80 years who were recruited from 44 primarily outpatient pulmonologist or allergist sites in the UK and the USA. Eligible\npatients had refractory or unexplained chronic cough lasting 1 year or longer, no radiographic chest abnormality, and 40 mm or more on a 100-mm cough severity visual analogue scale at\nenrolment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of three doses (7.5 mg, 20 mg, or 50 mg) of oral gefapixant twice daily, every day, for 84 days;\nvisits to investigative sites were on days 1, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, and 85. The randomisation schedule was computer generated using a permuted block algorithm by Advance Research Associates\n(Santa Clara, CA, USA). Patients and all personnel involved in the conduct and interpretation of the study were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was placebo-adjusted change from baseline\nin awake cough frequency after 12 weeks, assessed in the full analysis set, which is a subset of the intention-to-treat population. Adverse events were monitored and safety was evaluated in\nall patients receiving one or more doses of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02612610. FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2015, and July 26, 2016, 253 patients were randomly\nassigned to placebo (n=63), gefapixant 7.5 mg (n=64), gefapixant 20 mg (n=63), or gefapixant 50 mg (n=63) twice daily. The mean age of patients was 60.2 (SD 9.9) years and\n193 (76%) were women. At 12 weeks, patients' geometric mean awake cough frequency was 18.2 coughs per h (geometric SD 3.1) with placebo, and 14.5 coughs per h (3.7) with\n7.5 mg, 12.0 coughs per h (4.2) with 20 mg, and 11.3 coughs per h (2.8) with 50 mg gefapixant. Estimated percentage change relative to placebo was -22.0% (-41.8 to\n4.6; p=0.097) with 7.5 mg, -22.2% (-42.0 to 4.3; p=0.093) with 20 mg, and -37.0% (95% CI -53.3 to -14.9; p=0.0027) with 50 mg gefapixant. Dysgeusia was the most common\nadverse event, occurring in three (5%) patients given placebo, six (10%) given 7.5 mg gefapixant, 21 (33%) given 20 mg gefapixant, and 30 (48%) given 50 mg gefapixant. INTERPRETATION: Targeting\npurinergic receptor P2X3 with gefapixant at a dose of 50 mg twice daily significantly reduced cough frequency in patients with refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough after 12 weeks\nof treatment compared with placebo.

We\naimed to evaluate the potential of metformin to reverse such effects while sparing the anti-inflammatory benefits of glucocorticoids. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept, phase 2 trial involving\nfour hospitals in the UK. Patients without diabetes were eligible if they were between the ages of 18 and 75 years with an inflammatory disease treated with continuous prednisolone (>/=20\nmg/day for >/=4 weeks and remaining on >/=10 mg/day for the subsequent 12 weeks, or its cumulative dose-equivalent). Eligible patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either the metformin or placebo\ngroups, using a computer-generated randomisation table stratified according to age and BMI. Metformin and placebo were administered orally for 12 weeks in escalating doses: 850 mg/day for the first 5\ndays, 850 mg twice a day for the next 5 days, and 850 mg three times a day subsequently. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in visceral-to-subcutaneous fat area\nratio over 12 weeks, assessed by CT. Secondary outcomes included changes in metabolic, bone, cardiovascular, and inflammatory parameters over 12 weeks. Our analysis followed a modified intention-to-treat principle for the\nprimary outcome. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01319994. FINDINGS: Between July 17, 2012, and Jan 14, 2014, 849 patients were assessed for study eligibility, of which 53 were randomly\nassigned to receive either metformin (n=26) or placebo (n=27) for 12 weeks. 19 patients in the metformin group and 21 in the placebo group were eligible for the primary outcome\nanalysis. Both groups received an equivalent cumulative dose of glucocorticoids (1860 mg prednisolone-equivalent [IQR 1060-2810] in the metformin group vs 1770 mg [1020-2356] in the placebo group); p=0.76). No change\nin the visceral-to-subcutaneous fat area ratio between the treatment groups was observed (0.11, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.24; p=0.09), but patients in the metformin group lost truncal subcutaneous fat compared\nwith the placebo group (-3835 mm(2), 95% CI -6781 to -888; p=0.01). Improvements in markers of carbohydrate, lipid, liver, and bone metabolism were observed in the metformin group compared with\nthe placebo group. Additionally, those in the metformin group had improved fibrinolysis, carotid intima-media thickness, inflammatory parameters, and clinical markers of disease activity. The frequency of pneumonia (one event in\nthe metformin group vs seven in the placebo group; p=0.01), overall rate of moderate-to-severe infections (two vs 11; p=0.001), and all-cause hospital admissions due to adverse events (one vs nine;\np=0.001) were lower in the metformin group than in the placebo group. Patients in the metformin group had more events of diarrhoea than the placebo group (18 events vs eight;\np=0.01). INTERPRETATION: No significant changes in the visceral-to-subcutaneous fat area ratio between the treatment groups were observed; however, metformin administration did improve some of the metabolic profile and clinical outcomes\nfor glucocorticoid-treated patients with inflammatory disease, which warrants further investigation.

We reviewed the association of ART and\nother HIV-related factors on anal HPV infection, anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), and anal cancer among people living with HIV. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE and\nEMBASE for studies published between Jan 1, 1996, and Oct 30, 2019, that reported the association of HIV-related exposures (ART or highly active ART [HAART], HIV-RNA plasma viral load [PVL],\nand nadir or current CD4 cell count) with outcomes of anal high-risk HPV prevalence, incidence, and persistence; prevalence, incidence, progression, or regression of anal histological and cytological abnormalities; and anal\ncancer incidence. Effect estimates were extracted whenever available; otherwise, they were calculated from raw data. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and random-effects\nmeta-analyses were done to examine heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. This study is registered on the PROSPERO database, CRD42018007271. FINDINGS: We identified 6777 studies, of which 5377 were excluded before\nfull-text review. 122 studies providing estimates for 130 distinct populations matched the inclusion criteria. The populations comprised 417 006 people living with HIV (women, men who have sex with men,\nand men who have sex with women). 41 (32%) population estimates were not stratified by sex or sexual orientation. People living with HIV receiving ART had 35% lower high-risk HPV\nprevalence than ART-naive people (crude odds ratio [OR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.54-0.79; I(2) 12.1%, p=0.31) in 18 studies, and prolonged ART use was associated with a 10% reduction per year\nin high-risk HPV prevalence in two studies (adjusted OR 0.90, 0.85-0.95; I(2) 0%, p=0.88). People living with HIV with undetectable PVL had lower HSIL-AIN2+ prevalence than those with detectable PVL\n(crude OR 0.84, 0.72-0.98; I(2) 0%, p=0.80) in 16 studies, particularly if sustained for more than 1 year (crude OR 0.62, 0.47-0.81; I(2) 0%, p=0.51). ART was not associated with\nanal cancer incidence when adjusted for years living with HIV in three studies (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% CI 0.68-1.80; I(2) 0%, p=0.57), but ART users with sustained undetectable\nHIV PVL had 44% lower risk of anal cancer than those without (adjusted HR 0.56, 0.44-0.70; I(2) 0%, p=0.94) and for each increase in nadir CD4 cell counts of 100\ncells per muL, there was a 40% decrease in anal cancer incidence (crude HR 0.60, 0.46-0.78; I(2) 21.7%, p=0.26). INTERPRETATION: Effective ART use and early initiation at high nadir CD4\ncounts might reduce anal high-risk HPV infection and anal cancer risk. Although most studies were cross-sectional in design and few adjusted for potential confounders, this analysis provides comprehensive estimates of\nthe effect of ART and HIV-related factors on the natural history of anal HPV-related disease in people living with HIV.

Nuclear imaging could represent an opportunity to evaluate the entire medullary space non-invasively, yielding information about cell number, proliferation, or metabolism. Because imaging\nis not associated with infectious risk, it permits assessment of neutropenic timepoints that were previously inaccessible. This Viewpoint summarises the data regarding the use of nuclear medicine techniques to assess\nthe phases of HSCT: pre-transplant homoeostasis, induced aplasia, early settling and engraftment of infused cells, and later recovery of lymphocytes that target cancers or mediate tolerance. Although these data are\nnewly emerging and preliminary, nuclear medicine imaging approaches might advance our understanding of HSCT events and lead to novel recommendations to enhance outcomes.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109406", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32109405", "Title": "Comparison of international societal guidelines for the diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism during pregnancy.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy is challenging, with symptoms of pulmonary embolism mimicking those of pregnancy. Several\nkey components such as clinical prediction tools, risk stratification, laboratory tests, and imaging widely used for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the non-pregnant population show limitations for diagnosis in pregnancy.\nFurther, because of the difficulty of studying pregnant patients, high-quality research evaluating the performance of these diagnostic components in pregnancy is scarce. Seven international medical society guidelines present clinical diagnostic\npathways for evaluation of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy that show conflicting recommendations on the use of these diagnostic components.

The aim of our study was to determine whether point-of-care HIV viral load testing\nwith task shifting changed treatment and care outcomes for adults on antiretroviral therapy (ART) when compared with standard laboratory viral load testing. METHODS: We did an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled\ntrial in a public clinic in Durban, South Africa. We enrolled HIV-positive adults (aged >/=18 years) who presented for their first routine HIV viral load test 6 months after ART\ninitiation. Individuals were randomly assigned by a random number allocation sequence to receive either point-of-care viral load testing at enrolment and after 6 months with task shifting to enrolled nurses\n(intervention group), or laboratory viral load testing (standard-of-care group). The primary outcome was combined viral suppression (<200 copies per mL) and retention at 12 months after enrolment. A non-inferiority margin\nof 10% was used. Analysis was done by intention to treat. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03066128.

The aim\nof our analysis was to explore the efficacy and long-term safety of larotrectinib in a larger population of patients with TRK fusion-positive solid tumours. METHODS: Patients were enrolled and treated\nin a phase 1 adult, a phase 1/2 paediatric, or a phase 2 adolescent and adult trial. Some eligibility criteria differed between these studies. For this pooled analysis, eligible patients\nwere aged 1 month or older, with a locally advanced or metastatic non-CNS primary, TRK fusion-positive solid tumour, who had received standard therapy previously if available. This analysis set includes\nthe 55 patients on which approval of larotrectinib was based. Larotrectinib was administered orally (capsule or liquid formulation), on a continuous 28-day schedule, to adults mostly at a dose of\n100 mg twice daily, and to paediatric patients mostly at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) (maximum of 100 mg) twice daily. The primary endpoint was objective response as assessed by\nlocal investigators in an intention-to-treat analysis. Contributing trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02122913 (active not recruiting), NCT02637687 (recruiting), and NCT02576431 (recruiting). FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2014, and Feb 19, 2019,\n159 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer were enrolled and treated with larotrectinib. Ages ranged from less than 1 month to 84 years. The proportion of patients with an objective response\naccording to investigator assessment was 121 (79%, 95% CI 72-85) of 153 evaluable patients, with 24 (16%) having complete responses.

Despite the importance of these approaches, there has been a notable absence of efforts\nto compare them and consider how they might be integrated. This Personal View compares the three approaches and offers suggestions as to how they might work together, which represents a\nnovel position. We view self-disturbances as transformations of self that form the inseparable background against which psychotic symptoms emerge. Integrating computational psychiatric approaches with those used by phenomenologists in the\nfirst two listed approaches, we argue that delusions and hallucinations are inferences produced under extraordinary conditions and are both statistically and experientially as real for patients as other mental events.\nSuch inferences still approximate Bayes-optimality, given the personal, neurobiological, and environmental circumstances, and might be the only ones available to minimise prediction error. The added contribution we hope to make\nfocuses on how the dialogue between neuroscience and phenomenology might improve clinical practice.

METHODS: PRIME was updated with population demography of the UN World Population Prospects (UNWPP) 2019 revision, disability weights of the Global Burden of\nDisease (GBD) 2017 study, and cervical cancer burden from the Global Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence (GLOBOCAN) 2018 database. We estimated the lifetime health benefits for bivalent or quadrivalent and\nnonavalent vaccination of 9-year-old and 12-year-old girls at 90% coverage during 2020-29 in 177 countries. Health impact was presented in terms of cervical cancer cases, deaths, or disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)\naverted per 1000 vaccinated girls in comparison with the counterfactual scenario of no vaccination, and the number of girls needed to be vaccinated to prevent a single case, death, or\nDALY. FINDINGS: In estimating the health impact of HPV vaccination of 9-year-old girls, the combined updates to demography, disability weights, cervical cancer burden estimates resulted in a 26% increase in\nthe estimated number of cases averted, a 51% increase in deaths averted, and a 72% increase in DALYs averted per 1000 vaccinated girls for both the bivalent or quadrivalent and\nnonavalent vaccines, compared with previous estimates. With the updated model, the bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine was estimated to avert 15 cases, 12 deaths, and 243 DALYs per 1000 vaccinated\ngirls, and the nonavalent HPV vaccine was estimated to avert 19 cases, 14 deaths, and 306 DALYs per 1000 vaccinated girls. The health benefits of vaccination of 12-year-old girls were\nestimated to be similar but slightly decreased in comparison with vaccination of 9-year-old girls. INTERPRETATION: HPV vaccination provides greater health benefits and is more cost-effective than was previously estimated. The\ndemography update, which incorporates population aging, has the largest effect on the health impact estimates.

Most published data have come from east Asian study groups, with\nlittle information available from international cohorts. The effects of treatment advances on routine clinical practice across continental territories has not been clear. We aimed to improve understanding of the clinical\ncharacteristics and outcomes of patients with ENKTL. METHODS: We did a substudy of patients with ENKTL from the T-cell Project, a global prospective cohort study. The T-cell Project registered consecutively\ndiagnosed adults (>18 years) with newly diagnosed, untreated mature T-cell or NK lymphomas (WHO 2001 or 2008 classifications) from 74 centres in 13 countries (in Asia, Europe, North America, and\nSouth America). In total, 1695 patients with mature T-cell or NK lymphomas were enrolled between Oct 12, 2006 and Feb 28, 2018 in the T-cell Project. The first patient with\nENKTL was enrolled on Feb 15, 2007, and the last on May 26, 2017. Data on baseline characteristics, first-line treatment, treatment response, and survival outcomes were recorded in a central\ndatabase (locked March 30, 2019). The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival. The T-cell Project is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01142674. FINDINGS: 166 patients were diagnosed with ENKTL, comprising 11% of\n1553 eligible registered cases and distributed across 40 participating centres in four continents. At a median follow-up of 44 months (IQR 20-61), overall survival at 5 years was 54% (95%\nCI 44-63) in patients with nasal disease (n=98) and 34% (27-46) in patients with extranasal disease (n=68). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this study presents the largest international cohort of patients\nwith ENKTL. We describe a clinically significant improvement in the survival of patients with ENKTL treated in routine clinical practice over the past decade, likely to be attributable to the\nincreasing use of treatment protocols specific for ENKTL.

Examples range from parity violation in the subatomic weak force to homochirality in biomolecules.\nThe ability to achieve chirality-selective synthesis (chiral induction) is of great importance in stereochemistry, molecular biology and pharmacology(2). In condensed matter physics, a crystalline electronic system is geometrically chiral when\nit lacks mirror planes, space-inversion centres or rotoinversion axes(1). Typically, geometrical chirality is predefined by the chiral lattice structure of a material, which is fixed on formation of the crystal.\nBy contrast, in materials with gyrotropic order(3-6), electrons spontaneously organize themselves to exhibit macroscopic chirality in an originally achiral lattice. Although such order-which has been proposed as the quantum analogue\nof cholesteric liquid crystals-has attracted considerable interest(3-15), no clear observation or manipulation of gyrotropic order has been achieved so far. Here we report the realization of optical chiral induction and\nthe observation of a gyrotropically ordered phase in the transition-metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1T-TiSe2. We show that shining mid-infrared circularly polarized light on 1T-TiSe2 while cooling it below the critical temperature\nleads to the preferential formation of one chiral domain. The chirality of this state is confirmed by the measurement of an out-of-plane circular photogalvanic current, the direction of which depends\non the optical induction. Although the role of domain walls requires further investigation with local probes, the methodology demonstrated here can be applied to realize and control chiral electronic phases\nin other quantum materials(4,16).", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32103195", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32103194", "Title": "Strain-hardening and suppression of shear-banding in rejuvenated bulk metallic glass.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/28 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "Strain-hardening (the increase of flow stress with plastic strain) is the most important phenomenon in the mechanical behaviour of engineering alloys because it ensures that flow is delocalized, enhances tensile\nductility and inhibits catastrophic mechanical failure(1,2). Metallic glasses (MGs) lack the crystallinity of conventional engineering alloys, and some of their properties-such as higher yield stress and elastic strain limit(3)-are greatly\nimproved relative to their crystalline counterparts. MGs can have high fracture toughness and have the highest known 'damage tolerance' (defined as the product of yield stress and fracture toughness)(4) among\nall structural materials. However, the use of MGs in structural applications is largely limited by the fact that they show strain-softening instead of strain-hardening; this leads to extreme localization of\nplastic flow in shear bands, and is associated with early catastrophic failure in tension. Although rejuvenation of an MG (raising its energy to values that are typical of glass formation\nat a higher cooling rate) lowers its yield stress, which might enable strain-hardening(5), it is unclear whether sufficient rejuvenation can be achieved in bulk samples while retaining their glassy structure.\nHere we show that plastic deformation under triaxial compression at room temperature can rejuvenate bulk MG samples sufficiently to enable strain-hardening through a mechanism that has not been previously observed\nin the metallic state. This transformed behaviour suppresses shear-banding in bulk samples in normal uniaxial (tensile or compressive) tests, prevents catastrophic failure and leads to higher ultimate flow stress.

This force stems from fundamental interactions between quarks and gluons (the\nconstituents of nucleons) that are described by the equations of quantum chromodynamics. However, as these equations cannot be solved directly, nuclear interactions are described using simplified models, which are well\nconstrained at typical inter-nucleon distances(1-5) but not at shorter distances. This limits our ability to describe high-density nuclear matter such as that in the cores of neutron stars(6). Here we\nuse high-energy electron scattering measurements that isolate nucleon pairs in short-distance, high-momentum configurations(7-9), accessing a kinematical regime that has not been previously explored by experiments, corresponding to relative momenta between\nthe pair above 400 megaelectronvolts per c (c, speed of light in vacuum). As the relative momentum between two nucleons increases and their separation thereby decreases, we observe a transition\nfrom a spin-dependent tensor force to a predominantly spin-independent scalar force.

The uniquely arched morphology of the human midfoot is thought\nto stiffen it(5-9), whereas other primates have flat feet that bend severely in the midfoot(7,10,11). However, the relationship between midfoot geometry and stiffness remains debated in foot biomechanics(12,13), podiatry(14,15) and\npalaeontology(4-6). These debates centre on the medial longitudinal arch(5,6) and have not considered whether stiffness is affected by the second, transverse tarsal arch of the human foot(16). Here we show\nthat the transverse tarsal arch, acting through the inter-metatarsal tissues, is responsible for more than 40% of the longitudinal stiffness of the foot. The underlying principle resembles a floppy currency\nnote that stiffens considerably when it curls transversally. We derive a dimensionless curvature parameter that governs the stiffness contribution of the transverse tarsal arch, demonstrate its predictive power using mechanical\nmodels of the foot and find its skeletal correlate in hominin feet. In the foot, the material properties of the inter-metatarsal tissues and the mobility of the metatarsals may additionally\ninfluence the longitudinal stiffness of the foot and thus the curvature-stiffness relationship of the transverse tarsal arch.

Activation of female-specific oviposition descending neurons (oviDNs) is necessary and sufficient for egg laying, and is\nequally potent in virgin and mated females. After mating, sex peptide-a protein from the male seminal fluid-triggers many behavioural and physiological changes in the female, including the onset of egg\nlaying(1). Sex peptide is detected by sensory neurons in the uterus(2-4), and silences these neurons and their postsynaptic ascending neurons in the abdominal ganglion(5). We show that these abdominal ganglion\nneurons directly activate the female-specific pC1 neurons. GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric-acid-releasing) oviposition inhibitory neurons (oviINs) mediate feed-forward inhibition from pC1 neurons to both oviDNs and their major excitatory input, the oviposition excitatory\nneurons (oviENs).

The final seven steps occur in the lumen of\nthe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and require dolichylphosphate-activated mannose and glucose as donor substrates(2). The responsible enzymes-ALG3, ALG9, ALG12, ALG6, ALG8 and ALG10-are glycosyltransferases of the C-superfamily (GT-Cs), which are loosely\ndefined as containing membrane-spanning helices and processing an isoprenoid-linked carbohydrate donor substrate(3,4). Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of yeast ALG6 at 3.0 A resolution, which reveals a previously\nundescribed transmembrane protein fold. Comparison with reported GT-C structures suggests that GT-C enzymes contain a modular architecture with a conserved module and a variable module, each with distinct functional roles.\nWe used synthetic analogues of dolichylphosphate-linked and dolichylpyrophosphate-linked sugars and enzymatic glycan extension to generate donor and acceptor substrates using purified enzymes of the ALG pathway to recapitulate the activity\nof ALG6 in vitro. A second cryo-electron microscopy structure of ALG6 bound to an analogue of dolichylphosphate-glucose at 3.9 A resolution revealed the active site of the enzyme.

Although there has been a global increase in human life expectancy, increasing\nlongevity is rarely accompanied by an extended healthspan(4,7). Thus, understanding the origin of healthy behaviours in old people remains an important and challenging task. Here we report a conserved epigenetic\nmechanism underlying healthy ageing. Through genome-wide RNA-interference-based screening of genes that regulate behavioural deterioration in ageing Caenorhabditis elegans, we identify 59 genes as potential modulators of the rate of age-related\nbehavioural deterioration. Among these modulators, we found that a neuronal epigenetic reader, BAZ-2, and a neuronal histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferase, SET-6, accelerate behavioural deterioration in C. elegans by reducing\nmitochondrial function, repressing the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. This mechanism is conserved in cultured mouse neurons and human cells. Examination of human databases(8,9) shows that expression of the human\northologues of these C. elegans regulators, BAZ2B and EHMT1, in the frontal cortex increases with age and correlates positively with the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, ablation of Baz2b, the\nmouse orthologue of BAZ-2, attenuates age-dependent body-weight gain and prevents cognitive decline in ageing mice. Thus our genome-wide RNA-interference screen in C. elegans has unravelled conserved epigenetic negative regulators of\nageing, suggesting possible ways to achieve healthy ageing.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32103178", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32103177", "Title": "Lipid availability determines fate of skeletal progenitor cells via SOX9.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/28 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "The avascular nature of cartilage makes it a unique tissue(1-4), but whether and how the absence of nutrient supply regulates chondrogenesis remain unknown.

When lipids are scarce, skeletal\nprogenitors activate forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors, which bind to the Sox9 promoter and increase its expression. Besides initiating chondrogenesis, SOX9 acts as a regulator of cellular metabolism by\nsuppressing oxidation of fatty acids, and thus adapts the cells to an avascular life.

Myeloid cells derived from bone marrow contribute to the formation of the premetastatic microenvironment, which is required for disseminating tumour cells\nto engraft distant sites(4-6). There are currently no effective interventions that prevent the formation of the premetastatic microenvironment(6,7). Here we show that, after surgical removal of primary lung, breast and\noesophageal cancers, low-dose adjuvant epigenetic therapy disrupts the premetastatic microenvironment and inhibits both the formation and growth of lung metastases through its selective effect on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). In\nmouse models of pulmonary metastases, MDSCs are key factors in the formation of the premetastatic microenvironment after resection of primary tumours. Adjuvant epigenetic therapy that uses low-dose DNA methyltransferase and\nhistone deacetylase inhibitors, 5-azacytidine and entinostat, disrupts the premetastatic niche by inhibiting the trafficking of MDSCs through the downregulation of CCR2 and CXCR2, and by promoting MDSC differentiation into a\nmore-interstitial macrophage-like phenotype. A decreased accumulation of MDSCs in the premetastatic lung produces longer periods of disease-free survival and increased overall survival, compared with chemotherapy. Our data demonstrate that, even\nafter removal of the primary tumour, MDSCs contribute to the development of premetastatic niches and settlement of residual tumour cells.

KU binds to DNA ends, initiates cNHEJ, and\nrecruits and activates DNA-PKcs. KU also binds to RNA, but the relevance of this interaction in mammals is unclear. Here we use mouse models to show that DNA-PK has an\nunexpected role in the biogenesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and in haematopoiesis. The expression of kinase-dead DNA-PKcs abrogates cNHEJ(2). However, most mice that both expressed kinase-dead DNA-PKcs and lacked the\ntumour suppressor TP53 developed myeloid disease, whereas all other previously characterized mice deficient in both cNHEJ and TP53 expression succumbed to pro-B cell lymphoma(3). DNA-PK autophosphorylates DNA-PKcs, which is its\nbest characterized substrate. Blocking the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at the T2609 cluster, but not the S2056 cluster, led to KU-dependent defects in 18S rRNA processing, compromised global protein synthesis in\nhaematopoietic cells and caused bone marrow failure in mice. KU drives the assembly of DNA-PKcs on a wide range of cellular RNAs, including the U3 small nucleolar RNA, which is\nessential for processing of 18S rRNA(4). U3 activates purified DNA-PK and triggers phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at T2609. DNA-PK, but not other cNHEJ factors, resides in nucleoli in an rRNA-dependent manner\nand is co-purified with the small subunit processome. Together our data show that DNA-PK has RNA-dependent, cNHEJ-independent functions during ribosome biogenesis that require the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs and its\nphosphorylation at the T2609 cluster.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32103174", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32103173", "Title": "Sex-specific adipose tissue imprinting of regulatory T cells.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/28 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "Adipose tissue is an energy store and a dynamic endocrine organ(1,2).

Male VAT was enriched for Treg cells compared with female VAT, and Treg cells from\nmale VAT were markedly different from their female counterparts in phenotype, transcriptional landscape and chromatin accessibility. Heightened inflammation in the male VAT facilitated the recruitment of Treg cells via the\nCCL2-CCR2 axis. Androgen regulated the differentiation of a unique IL-33-producing stromal cell population specific to the male VAT, which paralleled the local expansion of Treg cells. Sex hormones also regulated\nVAT inflammation, which shaped the transcriptional landscape of VAT-resident Treg cells in a BLIMP1 transcription factor-dependent manner.

DESIGN:\nPragmatic, two armed, practice level, cluster randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 45 general practices in South West England (22 randomised to intervention and 23 to control\narm). Outcome data were collected from all intervention practices and 21/23 control practices. Total number of flagged patients was 24 473 (about 5% of practice list). INTERVENTION: Electronic algorithm and\nflag on practice systems identifying patients with HCV risk markers (such as history of opioid dependence or HCV tests with no evidence of referral to hepatology), staff educational training in\nHCV, and practice posters/leaflets to increase patients' awareness. Flagged patients were invited by letter for an HCV test (with one follow-up) and had on-screen pop-ups to encourage opportunistic testing. The\nintervention lasted one year, with practices recruited April to December 2016. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: uptake of HCV testing. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: number of positive HCV tests and yield (proportion\nHCV positive); HCV treatment assessment at hepatology; cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Baseline HCV testing of flagged patients (six months before study start) was 608/13 097 (4.6%) in intervention practices and 380/11\n376 (3.3%) in control practices. During the study 2071 (16%) of flagged patients in the intervention practices and 1163 (10%) in control practices were tested for HCV: overall intervention effect\nas an adjusted rate ratio of 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.21 to 2.08; P<0.001). HCV antibodies were detected in 129 patients from intervention practices and 51 patients from control practices\n(adjusted rate ratio 2.24, 1.47 to 3.42) with weak evidence of an increase in yield (6.2% v 4.4%; adjusted risk ratio 1.40, 0.99 to 1.95). Referral and assessment increased in\nintervention practices compared with control practices (adjusted rate ratio 5.78, 1.6 to 21.6) with a risk difference of 1.3 per 1000 and a \"number needed to help\" of one extra\nHCV diagnosis, referral, and assessment per 792 (95% confidence interval 558 to 1883) patients flagged. The average cost of HCV case finding was pound4.03 (95% confidence interval pound2.27 to pound5.80)\nper at risk patient and pound3165 per additional patient assessed at hepatology. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was pound6212 per quality adjusted life year (QALY), with 92.5% probability of being\nbelow pound20 000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: HepCATT had a modest impact but is a low cost intervention that merits optimisation and implementation as part of an NHS strategy to increase\nHCV testing and treatment.

"Abstract": "Importance: Dementia (also known as major neurocognitive disorder) is defined by a significant decline in 1 or more cognitive domains that interferes with a person's independence in daily activities. Dementia\naffects an estimated 2.4 to 5.5 million individuals in the United States, and its prevalence increases with age. Objective: To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force\n(USPSTF) commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for cognitive impairment, including mild cognitive impairment and mild to moderate dementia, in community-dwelling adults, including those 65 years or older\nresiding in independent living facilities. Population: This recommendation applies to community-dwelling older adults 65 years or older, without recognized signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment. Evidence Assessment: The USPSTF concludes\nthat the evidence is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment cannot be determined. Recommendation: The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient\nto assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment in older adults.

Objective: To systematically review the test accuracy of cognitive screening instruments and benefits and harms of interventions\nto treat cognitive impairment in older adults (>/=65 years) to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data Sources: MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through\nJanuary 2019, with literature surveillance through November 22, 2019. Study Selection: Fair- to good-quality English-language studies of cognitive impairment screening instruments, and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments aimed at persons with\nmild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild to moderate dementia, or their caregivers. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction; random-effects meta-analyses and qualitative synthesis. Main Outcomes and Measures:\nSensitivity, specificity; patient, caregiver, and clinician decision-making; patient function, quality of life, and neuropsychiatric symptoms; caregiver burden and well-being. Results: The review included 287 studies with more than 280000 older\nadults. One randomized clinical trial (RCT) (n = 4005) examined the direct effect of screening for cognitive impairment on patient outcomes, including potential harms, finding no significant differences in health-related\nquality of life at 12 months (effect size, 0.009 [95% CI, -0.063 to 0.080]). Fifty-nine studies (n = 38531) addressed the accuracy of 49 screening instruments to detect cognitive impairment.\nThe Mini-Mental State Examination was the most-studied instrument, with a pooled sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.92) and specificity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.93) to detect\ndementia using a cutoff of 23 or less or 24 or less (15 studies, n = 12796). Two hundred twenty-four RCTs and 3 observational studies including more than 240000 patients\nor caregivers addressed the treatment of MCI or mild to moderate dementia. None of the treatment trials were linked with a screening program; in all cases, participants were persons with\nknown cognitive impairment. Medications approved to treat Alzheimer disease (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine) improved scores on the ADAS-Cog 11 by 1 to 2.5 points over 3 months to 3\nyears. Psychoeducation interventions for caregivers resulted in a small benefit for caregiver burden (standardized mean difference, -0.24 [95% CI, -0.36 to -0.13) over 3 to 12 months. Intervention benefits were\nsmall and of uncertain clinical importance. Conclusions and Relevance: Screening instruments can adequately detect cognitive impairment. There is no empirical evidence, however, that screening for cognitive impairment improves patient or\ncaregiver outcomes or causes harm. It remains unclear whether interventions for patients or caregivers provide clinically important benefits for older adults with earlier detected cognitive impairment or their caregivers.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32096857", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32096856", "Title": "JAMA.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 25", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32096856", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32096855", "Title": "Tiny Branches.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/12 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 25", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32096855", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32096853", "Title": "Screening for Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/12 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 25", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32096853", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32096852", "Title": "Comparison of Abbreviated Breast MRI vs Digital Breast Tomosynthesis for Breast Cancer Detection Among Women With Dense Breasts Undergoing Screening.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/12 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 25", "Abstract": "Importance: Improved screening methods for women with dense breasts are needed because of their increased risk of breast cancer and of failed early diagnosis by screening mammography. Objective: To compare\nthe screening performance of abbreviated breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in women with dense breasts. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study with longitudinal follow-up at\n48 academic, community hospital, and private practice sites in the United States and Germany, conducted between December 2016 and November 2017 among average-risk women aged 40 to 75 years with\nheterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts undergoing routine screening. Follow-up ascertainment of cancer diagnoses was complete through September 12, 2019. Exposures: All women underwent screening by both DBT and abbreviated\nbreast MRI, performed in randomized order and read independently to avoid interpretation bias. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the invasive cancer detection rate. Secondary outcomes included\nsensitivity, specificity, additional imaging recommendation rate, and positive predictive value (PPV) of biopsy, using invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to define a positive reference standard. All outcomes\nare reported at the participant level. Pathology of core or surgical biopsy was the reference standard for cancer detection rate and PPV; interval cancers reported until the next annual screen\nwere included in the reference standard for sensitivity and specificity. Results: Among 1516 enrolled women, 1444 (median age, 54 [range, 40-75] years) completed both examinations and were included in the\nanalysis. The reference standard was positive for invasive cancer with or without DCIS in 17 women and for DCIS alone in another 6. No interval cancers were observed during follow-up.\nAbbreviated breast MRI detected all 17 women with invasive cancer and 5 of 6 women with DCIS. Digital breast tomosynthesis detected 7 of 17 women with invasive cancer and 2\nof 6 women with DCIS. The invasive cancer detection rate was 11.8 (95% CI, 7.4-18.8) per 1000 women for abbreviated breast MRI vs 4.8 (95% CI, 2.4-10.0) per 1000 women\nfor DBT, a difference of 7 (95% CI, 2.2-11.6) per 1000 women (exact McNemar P = .002). For detection of invasive cancer and DCIS, sensitivity was 95.7% (95% CI, 79.0%-99.2%)\nwith abbreviated breast MRI vs 39.1% (95% CI, 22.2%-59.2%) with DBT (P = .001) and specificity was 86.7% (95% CI, 84.8%-88.4%) vs 97.4% (95% CI, 96.5%-98.1%), respectively (P < .001).\nThe additional imaging recommendation rate was 7.5% (95% CI, 6.2%-9.0%) with abbreviated breast MRI vs 10.1% (95% CI, 8.7%-11.8%) with DBT (P = .02) and the PPV was 19.6% (95%\nCI, 13.2%-28.2%) vs 31.0% (95% CI, 17.0%-49.7%), respectively (P = .15). Conclusions and Relevance: Among women with dense breasts undergoing screening, abbreviated breast MRI, compared with DBT, was associated with\na significantly higher rate of invasive breast cancer detection. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between screening methods and clinical outcome.

"Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "The Hall-Petch relationship, according to which the strength of a metal increases as the grain size decreases, has been reported to break down at a critical grain size of around\n10 to 15 nanometres(1,2). As the grain size decreases beyond this point, the dominant mechanism of deformation switches from a dislocation-mediated process to grain boundary sliding, leading to material softening.\nIn one previous approach, stabilization of grain boundaries through relaxation and molybdenum segregation was used to prevent this softening effect in nickel-molybdenum alloys with grain sizes below 10 nanometres(3). Here\nwe track in situ the yield stress and deformation texturing of pure nickel samples of various average grain sizes using a diamond anvil cell coupled with radial X-ray diffraction. Our\nhigh-pressure experiments reveal continuous strengthening in samples with grain sizes from 200 nanometres down to 3 nanometres, with the strengthening enhanced (rather than reduced) at grain sizes smaller than 20\nnanometres. We achieve a yield strength of approximately 4.2 gigapascals in our 3-nanometre-grain-size samples, ten times stronger than that of a commercial nickel material. A maximum flow stress of 10.2\ngigapascals is obtained in nickel of grain size 3 nanometres for the pressure range studied here. We see similar patterns of compression strengthening in gold and palladium samples down to\nthe smallest grain sizes. Simulations and transmission electron microscopy reveal that the high strength observed in nickel of grain size 3 nanometres is caused by the superposition of strengthening mechanisms:\nboth partial and full dislocation hardening plus suppression of grain boundary plasticity. These insights contribute to the ongoing search for ultrastrong metals via materials engineering.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094661", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32094230", "Title": "GP is struck off after he showed no insight into reasons for his suspension.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 24", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094230", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32094213", "Title": "How can I tackle microaggressions in the workplace?", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 24", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094213", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32094212", "Title": "Faeces and vaccines could be the key to tackling antimicrobial resistance.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 24", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094212", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32094211", "Title": "Sixty seconds on . . . canals.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 24", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094211", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32094204", "Title": "Doctors who was struck off for misconduct is restored to the register after changing his ways.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 24", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094204", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32094156", "Title": "Promising new broad spectrum antibiotic compound identified by algorithm.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 24", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094156", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32094151", "Title": "Effect of dose and duration of reduction in dietary sodium on blood pressure levels: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/10 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 24", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the dose-response relation between reduction in dietary sodium and blood pressure change and to explore the impact of intervention duration. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA\nguidelines. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE(R), EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley) and reference lists of relevant articles up to 21 January 2019. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing\ndifferent levels of sodium intake undertaken among adult populations with estimates of intake made using 24 hour urinary sodium excretion. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two of three reviewers screened the\nrecords independently for eligibility. One reviewer extracted all data and the other two reviewed the data for accuracy. Reviewers performed random effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression. RESULTS: 133 studies\nwith 12 197 participants were included. The mean reductions (reduced sodium v usual sodium) of 24 hour urinary sodium, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 130\nmmol (95% confidence interval 115 to 145, P<0.001), 4.26 mm Hg (3.62 to 4.89, P<0.001), and 2.07 mm Hg (1.67 to 2.48, P<0.001), respectively. Each 50 mmol reduction in 24\nhour sodium excretion was associated with a 1.10 mm Hg (0.66 to 1.54; P<0.001) reduction in SBP and a 0.33 mm Hg (0.04 to 0.63; P=0.03) reduction in DBP. Reductions\nin blood pressure were observed in diverse population subsets examined, including hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals. For the same reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium there was greater SBP reduction in\nolder people, non-white populations, and those with higher baseline SBP levels. In trials of less than 15 days' duration, each 50 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium excretion was\nassociated with a 1.05 mm Hg (0.40 to 1.70; P=0.002) SBP fall, less than half the effect observed in studies of longer duration (2.13 mm Hg; 0.85 to 3.40; P=0.002).\nOtherwise, there was no association between trial duration and SBP reduction. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of blood pressure lowering achieved with sodium reduction showed a dose-response relation and was greater for\nolder populations, non-white populations, and those with higher blood pressure. Short term studies underestimate the effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure.

In this trial, we assessed the efficacy\nand safety of nerinetide in human ischaemia-reperfusion that occurs with rapid endovascular thrombectomy in patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS: For this multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study done\nin 48 acute care hospitals in eight countries, we enrolled patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion within a 12 h treatment window. Eligible patients were aged\n18 years or older with a disabling ischaemic stroke at the time of randomisation, had been functioning independently in the community before the stroke, had an Alberta Stroke Program Early\nCT Score (ASPECTS) greater than 4, and vascular imaging showing moderate-to-good collateral filling, as determined by multiphase CT angiography. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous nerinetide in a\nsingle dose of 2.6 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 270 mg, on the basis of estimated or actual weight (if known) or saline placebo by use of a\nreal-time, dynamic, internet-based, stratified randomised minimisation procedure. Patients were stratified by intravenous alteplase treatment and declared endovascular device choice. All trial personnel and patients were masked to sequence and treatment\nallocation. All patients underwent endovascular thrombectomy and received alteplase in usual care when indicated. The primary outcome was a favourable functional outcome 90 days after randomisation, defined as a modified\nRankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. Secondary outcomes were measures of neurological disability, functional independence in activities of daily living, excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1), and mortality. The analysis was\ndone in the intention-to-treat population and adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ASPECTS, occlusion location, site, alteplase use, and declared first device. The safety\npopulation included all patients who received any amount of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02930018. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2017, and Aug 12, 2019, 1105 patients were\nrandomly assigned to receive nerinetide (n=549) or placebo (n=556). 337 (61.4%) of 549 patients with nerinetide and 329 (59.2%) of 556 with placebo achieved an mRS score of 0-2 at\n90 days (adjusted risk ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.96-1.14; p=0.35). Secondary outcomes were similar between groups. We observed evidence of treatment effect modification resulting in inhibition of treatment effect in\npatients receiving alteplase. Serious adverse events occurred equally between groups. INTERPRETATION: Nerinetide did not improve the proportion of patients achieving good clinical outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy compared with patients receiving\nplacebo.

Global health", "Creation Date": "2020/02/24 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza virus is a common cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in young children. In 2008, we estimated that 20 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI and 1 million influenza-virus-associated\nsevere ALRI occurred in children under 5 years globally. Despite this substantial burden, only a few low-income and middle-income countries have adopted routine influenza vaccination policies for children and, where\npresent, these have achieved only low or unknown levels of vaccine uptake. Moreover, the influenza burden might have changed due to the emergence and circulation of influenza A/H1N1pdm09. We aimed\nto incorporate new data to update estimates of the global number of cases, hospital admissions, and mortality from influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years in 2018. METHODS: We\nestimated the regional and global burden of influenza-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years from a systematic review of 100 studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31,\n2018, and a further 57 high-quality unpublished studies. We adapted the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the risk of bias. We estimated incidence and hospitalisation rates of influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections by\nseverity, case ascertainment, region, and age. We estimated in-hospital deaths from influenza virus ALRI by combining hospital admissions and in-hospital case-fatality ratios of influenza virus ALRI. We estimated the upper\nbound of influenza virus-associated ALRI deaths based on the number of in-hospital deaths, US paediatric influenza-associated death data, and population-based childhood all-cause pneumonia mortality data in six sites in low-income\nand lower-middle-income countries. FINDINGS: In 2018, among children under 5 years globally, there were an estimated 109.5 million influenza virus episodes (uncertainty range [UR] 63.1-190.6), 10.1 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI cases\n(6.8-15.1); 870 000 influenza-virus-associated ALRI hospital admissions (543 000-1 415 000), 15 300 in-hospital deaths (5800-43 800), and up to 34 800 (13 200-97 200) overall influenza-virus-associated ALRI deaths. Influenza\nvirus accounted for 7% of ALRI cases, 5% of ALRI hospital admissions, and 4% of ALRI deaths in children under 5 years. About 23% of the hospital admissions and 36%\nof the in-hospital deaths were in infants under 6 months. About 82% of the in-hospital deaths occurred in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. INTERPRETATION: A large proportion of the influenza-associated burden\noccurs among young infants and in low-income and lower middle-income countries. Our findings provide new and important evidence for maternal and paediatric influenza immunisation, and should inform future immunisation policy\nparticularly in low-income and middle-income countries.

Gastroenterology & hepatology", "Creation Date": "2020/02/24 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 20", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with renal toxicity or reductions in bone mineral density, or both, in some patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\nTenofovir alafenamide is a tenofovir prodrug with high intrahepatic concentrations of active drug and reduced systemic tenofovir exposures compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In patients with chronic HBV, tenofovir alafenamide\nhas shown efficacy non-inferior to that of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with improved renal and bone safety. With this non-inferiority study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tenofovir\nalafenamide in patients with HBV infection switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate who are virally suppressed. METHODS: Patients with chronic HBV infection who had been receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 48\nweeks or more and who had HBV DNA less than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for at least 12 weeks were recruited to this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, phase 3\nnon-inferiority study. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg once a day or to continue tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once a day.\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was loss of virological control, defined as the proportion of patients who received at least one dose of study drug who had HBV DNA of at\nleast 20 IU/mL at week 48 by the modified US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm. Key safety endpoints were changes in hip and spine bone mineral density, estimated\ncreatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault, and markers of bone turnover and renal tubular function. The study was powered for non-inferiority in efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with a\n4% margin. Investigators and patients were unaware of treatment allocation and on-treatment results. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02979613. FINDINGS: Participants in this study were\nenrolled between Dec 29, 2016, and Oct 20, 2017. 541 patients were screened and 490 patients were randomly assigned to switch to tenofovir alafenamide or to stay on tenofovir disoproxil\nfumarate. Two patients assigned to receive tenofovir alafenamide did not receive treatment; thus the full analysis set for efficacy and safety analyses consisted of 243 patients in the tenofovir alafenamide\ngroup and 245 in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group. At week 48, one patient from each treatment group (both <1%) had HBV DNA of at least 20 IU/mL (difference in\nproportion 0.0%, 95% CI -1.9 to 2.0), thereby showing non-inferior efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Patients who received tenofovir alafenamide had significantly increased bone mineral density at\nhip (mean change 0.66% [SD 2.08] vs -0.51% [SD 1.91]; difference in least square means 1.17% [95% CI 0.80 to 1.54; p<0.0001]) and at spine (mean change 1.74% [3.46] vs\n-0.11% [3.13]; difference in least square means 1.85% [1.24 to 2.46; p<0.0001]), creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault relative to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (median change 0.94 mL/min [IQR -4.47 to 6.24] vs\n-2.74 mL/min [-7.89 to 1.88]; p <0.0001), and improved markers of bone turnover and tubular function at week 48. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection\n(18 [7%] of 243 patients in the tenofovir alafenamide group and 16 [7%] of 245 patients in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group) and nasopharyngitis (13 [5%] of 243 patients in\nthe tenofovir alafenamide group and 12 [5%] of 245 patients in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group). The incidence of grade 3 and above adverse events and serious adverse events was\nlow and similar between groups. No viral resistance was observed in patients who qualified for viral sequencing. INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that tenofovir alafenamide can be substituted for tenofovir disoproxil\nfumarate in patients with HBV infection for improved safety without a loss of efficacy.

Infectious diseases", "Creation Date": "2020/02/24 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 20", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Norovirus and rotavirus are the dominant pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis in children. To quantify their natural disease burden and transmission, we prospectively monitored households in an endemic setting in\nthe Netherlands, a high-income country that does not have a rotavirus vaccination programme. METHODS: We did a prospective, household survey-based cohort study in the Netherlands. Randomly selected households from the\nDutch Population Register were invited to participate if they had at least three household members, including a child younger than 2 years. A member of each household was asked to\nrecord the gastrointestinal symptoms of all household members every day for 10 consecutie weeks using an interactive smartphone application. Real-time detection of acute gastroenteritis onset on the basis of entered\nsymptoms activated requests for the case and one other household member to complete disease questionnaires and provide stool samples. Stool samples were analysed by real-time PCR for norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus\n40/41, and astrovirus. We calculated the per-pathogen proportion of households with at least one secondary acute gastroenteritis episode (epidemiologically but not microbiologically linked), the probability of a secondary episode in\nhousehold members at risk (secondary attack rate), and the microbiologically confirmed symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission rates. FINDINGS: During two seasons (January to March) in 2016 and 2017, 30 660 households\nwere invited to participate, of which 604 households including 2298 individuals were enrolled. 697 acute gastroenteritis episodes were detected in 358 households, with samples obtained from 609 (87%) of 697\nepisodes. Norovirus (150 [25%] of 609 cases) and rotavirus (91 [15%] cases) were most frequently detected. Astrovirus was detected in 50 (8%) samples and adenovirus 40/41 in 24 (4%) samples.\nOverall disease severity was higher in patients with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis than those with norovirus-positive acute gastroenteritis. Norovirus led to higher disease burden in adults than did rotavirus. Following an\nindex case, a secondary acute gastroenteritis episode occurred in 34 (35%) of 96 households for norovirus and 26 (46%) of 56 households for rotavirus. Secondary attack rates were 15% (37\nof 244 participants) for norovirus and 28% (33 of 120 participants) for rotavirus and asymptomatic transmission rates were 51% (52 of 102 household members) for norovirus and 22% (12 of\n55 household members) for rotavirus. The microbiologically confirmed symptomatic transmission rate for norovirus was 10% (25 of 254 household members) and 18% for rotavirus (21 of 119 household members). INTERPRETATION:\nIn households with young family members in a setting without rotavirus vaccination, norovirus is the dominant acute gastroenteritis pathogen, but rotavirus is associated with more severe disease. There was substantial\nwithin-household transmission, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. The study provides key quantities on transmission, which can inform vaccine policy decisions and act as a baseline for impact evaluations in high-income settings.\nFUNDING: The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (grant 91616158).", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32087775", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32087774", "Title": "Efficient transmission of viral gastroenteritis in Dutch households.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

We aimed to evaluate the effects and cost of different strategies to scale up screening and treatment of\nhepatitis C in Pakistan and determine what is required to meet WHO elimination targets for incidence. METHODS: We adapted a previous model of hepatitis C virus transmission, treatment, and disease\nprogression for Pakistan, calibrating using available data to incorporate a detailed cascade of care for hepatitis C with cost data on diagnostics and hepatitis C treatment. We modelled the effect\non various outcomes and costs of alternative scenarios for scaling up screening and hepatitis C treatment in 2018-30. We calibrated the model to country-level demographic data for 1960-2015 (including population\ngrowth) and to hepatitis C seroprevalence data from a national survey in 2007-08, surveys among people who inject drugs (PWID), and hepatitis C seroprevalence trends among blood donors. The cascade\nof care in our model begins with diagnosis of hepatitis C infection through antibody screening and RNA confirmation. Diagnosed individuals are then referred to care and started on treatment, which\ncan result in a sustained virological response (effective cure). We report the median and 95% uncertainty interval (UI) from 1151 modelled runs. FINDINGS: One-time screening of 90% of the 2018\npopulation by 2030, with 80% referral to treatment, was projected to lead to 13.8 million (95% UI 13.4-14.1) individuals being screened and 350 000 (315 000-385 000) treatments started annually,\ndecreasing hepatitis C incidence by 26.5% (22.5-30.7) over 2018-30. Prioritised screening of high prevalence groups (PWID and adults aged >/=30 years) and rescreening (annually for PWID, otherwise every 10 years)\nare likely to increase the number screened and treated by 46.8% and decrease incidence by 50.8% (95% UI 46.1-55.0). Decreasing hepatitis C incidence by 80% is estimated to require a\ndoubling of the primary screening rate, increasing referral to 90%, rescreening the general population every 5 years, and re-engaging those lost to follow-up every 5 years. This approach could cost\nUS$8.1 billion, reducing to $3.9 billion with lowest costs for diagnostic tests and drugs, including health-care savings, and implementing a simplified treatment algorithm. INTERPRETATION: Pakistan will need to invest about\n9.0% of its yearly health expenditure to enable sufficient scale up in screening and treatment to achieve the WHO hepatitis C elimination target of an 80% reduction in incidence by\n2030.

FINDINGS: Between June 9, 2015, and\nOct 24, 2018, 174 patients were randomly assigned to either the NPWT group (n=88) or the standard treatment group (n=86). Five patients in the NPWT group and four in the\nstandard treatment group were excluded from the intention-to-treat analysis. By day 5, 41 (49%) of 83 participants in the NPWT group and 49 (60%) of 82 participants in the standard\ntreatment group had closed wounds, with an absolute difference of 10 percentage points (95% CI -5 to 25, p=0.212; risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09). Net clinical\nbenefit was seen in 33 (41%) of 81 participants in the NPWT group and 34 (44%) of 78 participants in the standard treatment group, with an absolute difference of 3\npercentage points (95% CI -12 to 18, p=0.750; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.35). There was one in-hospital death in the standard treatment group and none in the NPWT\ngroup. The proportion of participants with sepsis, bleeding leading to blood transfusion, and limb amputation did not differ between groups. INTERPRETATION: NPWT did not yield superior clinical outcomes compared with\nstandard treatment for acute conflict-related extremity wounds. The results of this study not only question the use of NPWT, but also question the tendency for new and costly treatments to\nbe introduced into resource-limited conflict settings without supporting evidence for their effectiveness. This study shows that high-quality, randomised trials in challenging settings are possible, and our findings support the call\nfor further research that will generate context-specific evidence.

REPORT-HF is, to our knowledge, the first prospective global registry\ncollecting information on patient characteristics, management, and prognosis of acute heart failure using a single protocol. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in 1-year post-discharge mortality according\nto region, country income, and income inequality. METHODS: Patients were enrolled during hospitalisation for acute heart failure from 358 centres in 44 countries on six continents. We stratified countries according\nto a modified WHO regional classification (Latin America, North America, western Europe, eastern Europe, eastern Mediterranean and Africa, southeast Asia, and western Pacific), country income (low, middle, high) and income\ninequality (according to tertiles of Gini index). Risk factors were identified on the basis of expert opinion and knowledge of the literature. FINDINGS: Of 18 102 patients discharged, 3461 (20%)\ndied within 1 year. Important predictors of 1-year mortality were old age, anaemia, chronic kidney disease, presence of valvular heart disease, left ventricular ejection fraction phenotype (heart failure with reduced\nejection fraction [HFrEF] vs preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]), and being on guideline-directed medical treatment (GDMT) at discharge (p<0.0001 for all). Patients from eastern Europe had the lowest 1-year mortality (16%)\nand patients from eastern Mediterranean and Africa (22%) and Latin America (22%) the highest. Patients from lower-income countries (ie, </=US$3955 per capita; hazard ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.41-1.78), or with\ngreater income inequality (ie, from the highest Gini tertile; 1.25, 1.13-1.38) had a higher 1-year mortality compared with patients from regions with higher income (ie, >$12 235 per capita) or\nlower income inequality (ie, from the lowest Gini tertile). Compared with patients with HFrEF, patients with HFpEF had a lower 1-year mortality with little variation by income level (pinteraction for\nHFrEF vs HFpEF <0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Acute heart failure is associated with a high post-discharge mortality, particularly in patients with HFrEF from low-income regions with high income inequality. Regional differences exist\nin the proportion of eligible patients discharged on GDMT, which was strongly associated with mortality and might reflect lack of access to post-discharge care and prescribing of GDMT.

Global health", "Creation Date": "2020/02/23 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings, pneumonia diagnosis and management are based on thresholds for respiratory rate (RR) and oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SpO2) recommended by WHO. However, as RR increases and SpO2 decreases\nwith elevation, these thresholds might not be applicable at all altitudes. We sought to determine upper thresholds for RR and lower thresholds for SpO2 by age and altitude at four\nsites, with altitudes ranging from sea level to 4348 m. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled healthy children aged 0-23 months who lived within the study areas in India,\nGuatemala, Rwanda, and Peru. Participants were excluded if they had been born prematurely (<37 weeks gestation); had a congenital heart defect; had history in the past 2 weeks of overnight\nadmission to a health facility, diagnosis of pneumonia, antibiotic use, or respiratory or gastrointestinal signs; history in the past 24 h of difficulty breathing, fast breathing, runny nose, or nasal\ncongestion; and current runny nose, nasal congestion, fever, chest indrawing, or cyanosis. We measured RR either automatically with the Masimo Rad-97, manually, or both, and measured SpO2 with the Rad-97.\nTrained staff measured RR in duplicate and SpO2 in triplicate in children who had no respiratory symptoms or signs in the past 2 weeks. We estimated smooth percentiles for RR\nand SpO2 that varied by age and site using generalised additive models for location, shape, and scale. We compared these data with WHO RR and SpO2 thresholds for tachypnoea and\nhypoxaemia to determine agreement. FINDINGS: Between Nov 24, 2017, and Oct 10, 2018, we screened 2027 children for eligibility. 335 were ineligible, leaving 1692 eligible participants. 30 children were excluded\nbecause of missing values and 92 were excluded because of measurement or data entry errors, leaving 1570 children in the final analysis. 404 participants were from India (altitude 1-919 m),\n389 were from Guatemala (1036-2017 m), 341 from Rwanda (1449-1644 m), and 436 from Peru (3827-4348 m). Mean age was 7.2 months (SD 7.2) and 796 (50.7%) of 1570 participants\nwere female. Although average age was mostly similar between settings, the average participant age in Rwanda was noticeably younger, at 5.5 months (5.9). In the 1570 children included in the\nanalysis, mean RR was 31.9 breaths per min (SD 7.1) in India, 41.5 breaths per min in Guatemala (8.4), 44.0 breaths per min in Rwanda (10.8), and 48.0 breaths per\nmin in Peru (9.4). Mean SpO2 was 98.3% in India (SD 1.5), 97.3% in Guatemala (2.4), 96.2% in Rwanda (2.6), and 89.7% in Peru (3.5). Compared to India, mean RR\nwas 9.6 breaths per min higher in Guatemala, 12.1 breaths per min higher in Rwanda, and 16.1 breaths per min higher in Peru (likelihood ratio test p<0.0001). Smooth percentiles for\nRR and SpO2 varied by site and age. When we compared age-specific and site-specific 95th percentiles for RR and 5th percentiles for SpO2 against the WHO cutoffs, we found that\nthe proportion of false positives for tachypnoea increased with altitude: 0% in India (95% CI 0-0), 7.3% in Guatemala (4.1-10.4), 16.8% in Rwanda (12.9-21.1), and 28.9% in Peru (23.7-33.0). We\nalso found a high proportion of false positives for hypoxaemia in Peru (11.6%, 95% CI 7.0-14.7). INTERPRETATION: WHO cutoffs for fast breathing and hypoxaemia overlap with RR and SpO2 values\nthat are normal for children in different altitudes. Use of WHO definitions for fast breathing could result in misclassification of pneumonia in many children who live at moderate to high\naltitudes and show acute respiratory signs. The 5th percentile for SpO2 was in reasonable agreement with the WHO definition of hypoxaemia in all regions except for Peru (the highest altitude\nsite). Misclassifications could result in inappropriate management of paediatric respiratory illness and misdirection of potentially scarce resources such as antibiotics and supplemental oxygen. Future studies at various altitudes are needed\nto validate our findings and recommend a revision to current guidelines. Substantiating research in sick children is still needed.

METHODS: We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys collected between 2010 and 2016, from LMICs that provided birth histories\nand information on ethnicity or a proxy variable. We calculated neonatal (age 0-27 days), post-neonatal (age 28-364 days), child (age 1-4 years), and under-5 mortality rates (U5MRs) for each ethnic\ngroup within each country. We assessed differences in mortality between ethnic groups using a likelihood ratio test, Theil's index, and between-group variance. We used multivariable analyses of U5MR by ethnicity\nto adjust for household wealth, maternal education, and urban-rural residence. FINDINGS: We included data from 36 LMICs, which included 2 812 381 livebirths among 415 ethnic groups. In 25 countries,\nsignificant differences in U5MR by ethnic group were identified (all p<0.05 likelihood ratio test). In these countries, the median mortality ratio between the ethnic groups with the highest and lowest\nU5MRs was 3.3 (IQR 2.1-5.2; range 1.5-8.5), whereas among the remaining 11 countries, the median U5MR ratio was 1.9 (IQR 1.7-2.5; range 1.4-10.0). Ethnic gaps were wider for child mortality\nthan for neonatal or post-neonatal mortality. In nearly all countries, adjustment for wealth, education, and place of residence did not affect ethnic gaps in mortality, with the exception of Guatemala,\nIndia, Laos, and Nigeria. The largest ethnic group did not have the lowest U5MR in any of the countries studied. INTERPRETATION: Significant ethnic disparities in child survival were identified in\nmore than two-thirds of the countries studied. Regular analyses of ethnic disparities are essential for monitoring trends, targeting, and assessing the impact of health interventions. Such analyses will contribute to\nthe effort towards leaving no one behind, which is at the centre of the SDGs.

Global health", "Creation Date": "2020/02/23 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peer-reviewed literature on health is almost exclusively published in English, limiting the uptake of research for decision making in francophone African countries. We used results from the Global Burden\nof Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to assess the burden of disease in francophone Africa and inform health professionals and their partners in the region. METHODS: We\nassessed the burden of disease in the 21 francophone African countries and compared the results with those for their non-francophone counterparts in three economic communities: the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States, the Economic Community of Central African States, and the Southern African Development Community. GBD 2017 employed a variety of statistical models to determine the number of deaths from\neach cause, through the Cause of Death Ensemble model algorithm, using CoDCorrect to ensure that the number of deaths per cause did not exceed the total number of estimated deaths.\nAfter producing estimates for the number of deaths from each of the 282 fatal outcomes included in the GBD 2017 list of causes, the years of life lost (YLLs) due\nto premature death were calculated. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were\ncalculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. All calculations are presented with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). A sample of 1000 draws was taken from the posterior distribution of each\nestimation step; aggregation of uncertainty across age, sex, and location was done on each draw, assuming independence of uncertainty. The lower and upper UIs represent the ordinal 25th and 975th\ndraws of each quantity and attempt to describe modelling as well as sampling error. FINDINGS: In 2017, 779 deaths (95% UI 750-809) per 100 000 population occurred in francophone Africa,\na decrease of 45.3% since 1990. Malaria, lower respiratory infections, neonatal disorders, diarrhoeal diseases, and tuberculosis were the top five Level 3 causes of death. These five causes were found\namong the six leading causes of death in most francophone countries. In 2017, francophone Africa experienced 53 570 DALYs (50 164-57 361) per 100 000 population, distributed between 43 708\nYLLs (41 673-45 742) and 9862 YLDs (7331-12 749) per 100 000 population. In 2017, YLLs constituted the majority of DALYs in the 21 countries of francophone Africa. Age-specific and\ncause-specific mortality and population ageing were responsible for most of the reductions in disease burden, whereas population growth was responsible for most of the increases. INTERPRETATION: Francophone Africa still carries\na high burden of communicable and neonatal diseases, probably due to the weakness of health-care systems and services, as evidenced by the almost complete attribution of DALYs to YLLs. To\ncope with this burden of disease, francophone Africa should define its priorities and invest more resources in health-system strengthening and in the quality and quantity of health-care services, especially in\nrural and remote areas. The region could also be prioritised in terms of technical and financial assistance focused on achieving these goals, as much as on demographic investments including education\nand family planning.

We aimed to assess PrEP uptake and engagement after population-level HIV testing and universal PrEP access\nto characterise gaps in the PrEP cascade in rural Kenya and Uganda. METHODS: We did a 72-week interim analysis of observational data from the ongoing SEARCH (Sustainable East Africa Research\nin Community Health) study. Following community sensitisation and PrEP education, we did HIV testing and offered PrEP at health fairs and facilities in 16 rural communities in western Kenya, eastern\nUganda, and western Uganda. We provided enhanced PrEP counselling to individuals 15 years and older who were assessed as having an elevated HIV risk on the basis of serodifferent partnership\nor empirical risk score, or who otherwise self-identified as being at high risk but were not in serodifferent partnerships or identified by the risk score. PrEP follow-up visits were done\nat facilities, homes, or community locations. We assessed PrEP uptake within 90 days of HIV testing, programme engagement (follow-up visit attendance at week 4, week 12, and every 12 weeks\nthereafter), refills, self-reported adherence up to 72 weeks, and concentrations of tenofovir in hair samples from individuals reporting HIV risk and adherence during follow-up, and analysed factors associated with uptake\nand adherence. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01864603. FINDINGS: Between June 6, 2016, and June 23, 2017, 70 379 community residents 15 years or older who had not previously\nbeen diagnosed with HIV were tested during population-level HIV testing. Of these individuals, 69 121 tested HIV-negative, 12 935 of whom had elevated HIV risk (1353 [10%] serodifferent partnership, 6938\n[54%] risk score, 4644 [36%] otherwise self-identified risk). 3489 (27%) initiated PrEP, 2865 (82%) of whom did so on the same day as HIV testing and 1733 (50%) of whom\nwere men. PrEP uptake was lower among individuals aged 15-24 years (adjusted odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.45-0.68) and mobile individuals (0.61, 0.41-0.91). At week 4, among 3466 individuals who\ninitiated PrEP and did not withdraw or die before the first visit, 2215 (64%) were engaged in the programme, 1701 (49%) received medication refills, and 1388 (40%) self-reported adherence. At\nweek 72, 1832 (56%) of 3274 were engaged, 1070 (33%) received a refill, and 900 (27%) self-reported adherence. Among participants reporting HIV risk at weeks 4-72, refills (89-93%) and self-reported\nadherence (70-76%) were high. Among sampled participants self-reporting adherence at week 24, the proportion with tenofovir concentrations in the hair reflecting at least four doses taken per week was 66%,\nand reflecting seven doses per week was 44%. Participants who stopped PrEP accepted HIV testing at 4274 (83%) of 5140 subsequent visits; half of these participants later restarted PrEP. 29\nparticipants of 3489 who initiated PrEP had serious adverse events, including seven deaths. Five adverse events (all grade 3) were assessed as being possibly related to the study drug. INTERPRETATION:\nDuring population-level HIV testing, inclusive risk assessment (combining serodifferent partnership, an empirical risk score, and self-identification of HIV risk) was feasible and identified individuals who could benefit from PrEP.

We tested whether daily use of emollient in the first year could prevent eczema in high-risk children. METHODS: We did a multicentre, pragmatic,\nparallel-group, randomised controlled trial in 12 hospitals and four primary care sites across the UK. Families were approached via antenatal or postnatal services for recruitment of term infants (at least\n37 weeks' gestation) at high risk of developing eczema (ie, at least one first-degree relative with parent-reported eczema, allergic rhinitis, or asthma, diagnosed by a doctor). Term newborns with a\nfamily history of atopic disease were randomly assigned (1:1) to application of emollient daily (either Diprobase cream or DoubleBase gel) for the first year plus standard skin-care advice (emollient group)\nor standard skin-care advice only (control group). The randomisation schedule was created using computer-generated code (stratified by recruiting centre and number of first-degree relatives with atopic disease) and participants were\nassigned to groups using an internet-based randomisation system. The primary outcome was eczema at age 2 years (defined by UK working party criteria) with analysis as randomised regardless of adherence\nto allocation for participants with outcome data collected, and adjusting for stratification variables. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN21528841. Data collection for long-term follow-up is ongoing, but the trial\nis closed to recruitment. FINDINGS: 1394 newborns were randomly assigned to study groups between Nov 19, 2014, and Nov 18, 2016; 693 were assigned to the emollient group and 701\nto the control group. Adherence in the emollient group was 88% (466 of 532) at 3 months, 82% (427 of 519) at 6 months, and 74% (375 of 506) at\n12 months in those with complete questionnaire data. At age 2 years, eczema was present in 139 (23%) of 598 infants with outcome data collected in the emollient group and\n150 (25%) of 612 infants in the control group (adjusted relative risk 0.95 [95% CI 0.78 to 1.16], p=0.61; adjusted risk difference -1.2% [-5.9 to 3.6]). Other eczema definitions supported\nthe results of the primary analysis. Mean number of skin infections per child in year 1 was 0.23 (SD 0.68) in the emollient group versus 0.15 (0.46) in the control\ngroup; adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.55 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.09). INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence that daily emollient during the first year of life prevents eczema in high-risk children\nand some evidence to suggest an increased risk of skin infections. Our study shows that families with eczema, asthma, or allergic rhinitis should not use daily emollients to try and\nprevent eczema in their newborn.

The study aimed to determine if either\nregular skin emollients applied from 2 weeks of age, or early complementary feeding introduced between 12 and 16 weeks of age, reduced development of atopic dermatitis by age 12 months\nin the general infant population. METHODS: This population-based 2x2 factorial, randomised clinical trial was done at Oslo University Hospital and Ostfold Hospital Trust, Oslo, Norway; and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm,\nSweden. Infants of women recruited antenatally at the routine ultrasound pregnancy screening at 18 weeks were cluster-randomised at birth from 2015 to 2017 to the following groups: (1) controls with\nno specific advice on skin care while advised to follow national guidelines on infant nutrition (no intervention group); (2) skin emollients (bath additives and facial cream; skin intervention group); (3)\nearly complementary feeding of peanut, cow's milk, wheat, and egg (food intervention group); or (4) combined skin and food interventions (combined intervention group). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) using computer-\ngenerated cluster randomisation based on 92 geographical living area blocks as well as eight 3-month time blocks. Carers were instructed to apply the interventions on at least 4 days per\nweek. Atopic dermatitis by age 12 months was the primary outcome, based on clinical investigations at 3, 6 and 12 months by investigators masked to group allocation. Atopic dermatitis was\nassessed after completing the 12-month investigations and diagnosed if either of the UK Working Party and Hanifin and Rajka (12 months only) diagnostic criteria were fulfilled. The primary efficacy analyses\nwas done by intention-to-treat analysis on all randomly assigned participants. Food allergy results will be reported once all investigations at age 3 years are completed in 2020. This was a\nstudy performed within ORAACLE (the Oslo Research Group of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood; the Lung and Environment). The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02449850. FINDINGS: 2697 women were recruited\nbetween Dec 9, 2014, and Oct 31, 2016, from whom 2397 newborn infants were enrolled from April 14, 2015, to April 11, 2017. Atopic dermatitis was observed in 48 (8%)\nof 596 infants in the no intervention group, 64 (11%) of 575 in the skin intervention group, 58 (9%) of 642 in the food intervention group, and 31 (5%) of\n583 in the combined intervention group. Neither skin emollients nor early complementary feeding reduced development of atopic dermatitis, with a risk difference of 3.1% (95% CI -0.3 to 6.5) for\nskin intervention and 1.0% (-2.1 to 4.1) for food intervention, in favour of control. No safety concerns with the interventions were identified. Reported skin symptoms and signs (including itching, oedema,\nexanthema, dry skin, and urticaria) were no more frequent in the skin, food, and combined intervention groups than in the no intervention group. INTERPRETATION: Neither early skin emollients nor early\ncomplementary feeding reduced development of atopic dermatitis by age 12 months.

The aim of this study was to establish the benefits of contact\nisolation over standard precautions for reducing the incidence density of ESBL-E colonisation and infection in adult medical and surgical wards with an active surveillance culture programme. METHODS: We did a\ncluster-randomised crossover trial in adult wards in four European university hospitals. Medical, surgical, or combined medical-surgical wards without critical care were randomised to continue standard precautions alone or implement contact\nisolation alongside standard precautions for 12 months, followed by a 1 month washout period and 12 months of the alternate strategy. Randomisation was done via a computer-generated sequence, with a\nblock size of two consecutive wards. Only laboratory technicians and data analysts were masked to allocation. Patients were screened for ESBL-E carriage within 3 days of admission, once a week\nthereafter, and on discharge. The primary outcome was the incidence density of ESBL-E, defined as the acquisition rate per 1000 patient-days at risk at the ward level and assessed in\nthe per-protocol population, which included all patients screened at least twice with a length of stay of more than 1 week for each intervention period. No specific safety measures were\nassessed given the minimal risk of adverse events. The trial is registered, ISRCTN57648070. FINDINGS: We enrolled 20 wards from four hospitals in Germany (eight wards), the Netherlands (four wards), Spain\n(four wards), and Switzerland (four wards). Between Jan 6, 2014, and Aug 31, 2016, 38 357 patients were admitted to these wards. Among 15 184 patients with a length of\nstay of more than 1 week, 11 368 patients (75%) were screened at least twice. The incidence density of ward-acquired ESBL-E was 6.0 events per 1000 patient-days at risk (95%\nCI 5.4-6.7) during periods of contact isolation and 6.1 (5.5-6.7) during periods of standard precautions (p=0.9710). Multivariable analysis adjusted for length of stay, percentage of patients screened, and prevalence in\nfirst screening cultures yielded an incidence rate ratio of 0.99 (95% CI 0.80-1.22; p=0.9177) for care under contact isolation compared with standard precautions.

Face-mask sampling detects exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We aimed to investigate bacillary output from patients with pulmonary\ntuberculosis and to assess the potential of face-mask sampling as a diagnostic method in active case-finding. METHODS: We did a 24-h longitudinal study in patients from three hospitals in Pretoria,\nSouth Africa, with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients underwent 1 h of face-mask sampling eight times over a 24-h period, with contemporaneous sputum sampling. M tuberculosis was detected by quantitative\nPCR. We also did an active case-finding pilot study in inhabitants of an informal settlement near Pretoria. We enrolled individuals with symptoms of tuberculosis on the WHO screening questionnaire. Participants\nprovided sputum and face-mask samples that were tested with the molecular assay Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. Sputum-negative and face-mask-positive individuals were followed up prospectively for 20 weeks by bronchoscopy, PET-CT, and\nfurther sputum analysis to validate the diagnosis. FINDINGS: Between Sept 22, 2015, and Dec 3, 2015, 78 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were screened for the longitudinal study, of whom 24\ncompleted the study (20 had HIV co-infection). M tuberculosis was detected in 166 (86%) of 192 face-mask samples and 38 (21%) of 184 assessable sputum samples obtained over a 24-h\nperiod. Exhaled M tuberculosis output showed no diurnal pattern and did not associate with cough frequency, sputum bacillary content, or chest radiographic disease severity. On May 16, 2018, 45 individuals\nwere screened for the prospective active case-finding pilot study, of whom 20 had tuberculosis symptoms and were willing to take part. Eight participants were diagnosed prospectively with pulmonary tuberculosis, of\nwhom six were exclusively face-mask positive at screening. Four of these participants (three of whom were HIV-positive) had normal findings on chest radiography but had treatment-responsive early tuberculosis-compatible lesions on\nPET-CT scans, with Xpert-positive sputum samples after 6 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Face-mask sampling offers a highly efficient and non-invasive method for detecting exhaled M tuberculosis, informing the presence of active infection\nboth with greater consistency and at an earlier disease stage than with sputum samples. The approach shows potential for diagnosis and screening, particularly in difficult-to-reach communities.

Respiratory medicine", "Creation Date": "2020/02/23 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early use of parenteral nutrition in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) negatively affects development of executive functions, externalising behaviour, and visual-motor integration 2 years later, compared with omitting\nparenteral nutrition until PICU day 8 (late parenteral nutrition). The molecular basis of this finding is uncertain. We aimed to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation changes occur during critical\nillness and that early parenteral nutrition (or a specific macronutrient component hereof) contributes to these changes, which could explain its negative effects on neurocognitive development. METHODS: This pre-planned secondary analysis\nof the multicentre PEPaNIC trial (2012-18) included all patients with a last PICU day blood sample (n=825, aged 0-17 years at PICU admission) who were randomly allocated (1:1) to early\nparenteral nutrition or late parenteral nutrition, as compared with 352 demographically matched healthy children. Investigators were masked to treatment allocation. We used the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip to determine the\ngenome-wide peripheral blood leukocyte DNA methylation of 865 859 CpG sites, yielding high-quality results for 403 patients allocated to early parenteral nutrition and for 411 patients allocated to late parenteral\nnutrition. Applying a false discovery rate of less than 0.05, DNA methylation of patients on the last PICU day was compared with that of healthy children, after excluding all CpG\nsites differentially methylated upon PICU admission, because these reflected pre-admission conditions and altered leukocyte composition. We used bootstrapped multivariable linear and non-linear regression analyses to assess the effect of early\nparenteral nutrition versus late parenteral nutrition on illness-induced alterations in DNA methylation and to what extent differentially methylated CpG sites explained impaired neurocognitive development 2 years later. FINDINGS: During PICU\nstay, 159 CpG sites were methylated differently in patients admitted to the PICU than in healthy children, with mean effect sizes of 2.6% (SD 2.5) up to 21.6% (p<0.02). These\ndifferentially methylated CpG sites occurred in genes involved in brain development, plasticity, and signalling; neuronal differentiation, migration, and growth; metabolism; transcriptional regulation; physical development and locomotion; and several neurodegenerative and\nneuropsychiatric diseases. Early parenteral nutrition and, in particular, the dose of amino acids, independently contributed to the differential methylation of 37 (23%) of these 159 CpG sites (p=0.0001 to 0.050),\nwhich could explain the adverse effect of early parenteral nutrition on neurocognitive development at 2-year follow-up (R(2) 0.61 [SD 0.01]). INTERPRETATION: Early parenteral nutrition during paediatric critical illness altered DNA\nmethylation, which suggests a plausible molecular basis for its negative effect on long-term neurocognitive development. Early administration of amino acids, rather than of glucose or lipids, mostly explained the aberrant\nDNA methylation-a finding that requires further investigation.

Neurology", "Creation Date": "2020/02/23 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: S44819, a selective GABAA alpha5 receptor antagonist, reduces tonic post-ischaemic inhibition of the peri-infarct cortex. S44819 improved stroke recovery in rodents and increased cortical excitability in a transcranial magnetic\nstimulation study in healthy volunteers. The Randomized Efficacy and Safety Trial of Oral GABAA alpha5 antagonist S44819 after Recent ischemic Event (RESTORE BRAIN) aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy\nof S44819 for enhancing clinical recovery of patients with ischaemic stroke. METHODS: RESTORE BRAIN was an international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 2 trial that evaluated the safety and\nefficacy of oral S44189 in patients with recent ischaemic stroke. The study was done in specialised stroke units in 92 actively recruiting centres in 14 countries: ten were European countries\n(Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the UK) and four were non-European countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, and South Korea). Patients aged 18-85 years with acute\nischaemic stroke involving cerebral cortex (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 7-20) without previous disability were eligible for inclusion. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg S44819\ntwice a day, 300 mg S44819 twice a day, or placebo twice a day by a balanced, non-adaptive randomisation method with a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment randomisation and allocation were centralised\nvia the interactive web response system using computer-generated random sequences with a block size of 3. Blinding of treatment was achieved by identical appearance and taste of all sachets. Patients,\ninvestigators and individuals involved in the analysis of the trial were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 90 days from onset of\ntreatment, evaluated by shift analysis (predefined main analysis) or by dichotomised analyses using 0-1 versus 2-6 and 0-2 versus 3-6 cutoffs (predefined secondary analysis). Secondary endpoints were the effects of\nS44819 on the NIHSS and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, time needed to complete parts A and B of the Trail Making Test, and the Barthel index. Efficacy analyses were\ndone on all patients who received at least one dose of treatment and had at least one mRS score taken after day 5 (specifically, on or after day 30). Safety\nwas compared across treatment groups for all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02877615. FINDINGS: Between Dec 19, 2016, and Nov\n16, 2018, 585 patients were enrolled in the study. Of these, 197 (34%) were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg S44819 twice a day, 195 (33%) to receive 300 mg\nS44819 twice a day, and 193 (33%) to receive placebo twice a day. 189 (96%) of 197 patients in the 150 mg S44819 group, 188 (96%) of 195 patients in\nthe 300 mg S44819 group, and 191 (99%) patients in the placebo group received at least one dose of treatment and had at least one mRS score taken after day\n5, and were included in efficacy analyses. 195 (99%) of 197 patients in the 150 mg S44819 group, 194 (99%) of 195 patients in the 300 mg S44819 group, and\n193 (100%) patients in the placebo group received at least one dose of treatment, and were included in safety analyses. The primary endpoint of mRS at day 90 did not\ndiffer between each of the two S44819 groups and the placebo group (OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.64-1.31]; p=0.80 for 150 mg S44819 compared with placebo and OR 1.17 [95% CI\n0.81-1.67]; p=0.80 for 300 mg S44819 compared with placebo). Likewise, dichotomised mRS scores at day 90 (mRS 0-2 vs 3-6 or mRS 0-1 vs 2-6) did not differ between groups.\nSecondary endpoints did not reveal any significant group differences. The median NIHSS score at day 90 did not differ between groups (4 [IQR 2-8] in 150 mg S44819 group, 4\n[2-7] in 300 mg S44819 group, and 4 [2-6] in placebo group), nor did the number of patients at day 90 with an NIHSS score of up to 5 (95\n[61%] of 156 in 150 mg S44819 group, 106 [66%] of 161 in 300 mg S44819 group, and 104 [66%] of 157 in placebo group) versus more than 5 (61\n[39%] in 150 mg S44819 group, 55 [34%] in 300 mg S44819 group, and 53 [34%] in placebo group). Likewise, the median MoCA score (22.0 [IQR 17.0-26.0] in 150 mg\nS44819 group, 23.0 [19.0-26.5] in 300 mg S44819 group, and 22.0 [17.0-26.0] in placebo group), time needed to complete parts A (50 s [IQR 42-68] in 150 mg S44819 group,\n49 s [36-63] in 300 mg S44819 group, and 50 s [38-68] in placebo group) and B (107 s [81-144] in 150 mg S44819 group, 121 s [76-159] in 300\nmg S44819 group, and 130 s [86-175] in placebo group) of the Trail Making Test, and the Barthel index (90 [IQR 60-100] in 150 mg S44819 group, 90 [70-100] in\n300 mg S44819 group, and 90 [70-100] in placebo group) were similar in all groups. Number and type of adverse events were similar between the three groups. There were no\ndrug-related adverse events and no drug-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: There was no evidence that S44819 improved clinical outcome in patients after ischaemic stroke, and thus S44819 cannot be recommended for stroke\ntherapy. The concept of tonic inhibition after stroke should be re-evaluated in humans.

Approaches that force HIV transcription from these cells, making them susceptible to killing-termed\nkick and kill regimens-have been explored as a strategy towards an HIV cure. RIVER is the first randomised trial to determine the effect of ART-only versus ART plus kick and\nkill on markers of the HIV reservoir. METHODS: This phase 2, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial was undertaken at six clinical sites in the UK. Patients aged 18-60 years who\nwere confirmed as HIV-positive within a maximum of the past 6 months and started ART within 1 month from confirmed diagnosis were randomly assigned by a computer generated randomisation list\nto receive ART-only (control) or ART plus the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat (the kick) and replication-deficient viral vector T-cell inducing vaccines encoding conserved HIV sequences ChAdV63. HIVconsv-prime and MVA.HIVconsv-boost (the\nkill; ART + V + V; intervention). The primary endpoint was total HIV DNA isolated from peripheral blood CD4(+) T-cells at weeks 16 and 18 after randomisation. Analysis was by\nintention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02336074. FINDINGS: Between June 14, 2015 and Jul 11, 2017, 60 men with HIV were randomly assigned to receive either an\nART-only (n=30) or an ART + V + V (n=30) regimen; all 60 participants completed the study, with no loss-to-follow-up. Mean total HIV DNA at weeks 16 and 18 after\nrandomisation was 3.02 log10 copies HIV DNA per 10(6) CD4(+) T-cells in the ART-only group versus 3.06 log10 copies HIV DNA per 10(6) CD4(+) T-cells in ART + V +\nV group, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (mean difference of 0.04 log10 copies HIV DNA per 10(6) CD4(+) T-cells [95% CI -0.03 to 0.11; p=0.26]). There\nwere no intervention-related serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: This kick and kill approach conferred no significant benefit compared with ART alone on measures of the HIV reservoir. Although this does not\ndisprove the efficacy kick and kill strategy, for future trials enhancement of both kick and kill agents will be required.

Psychiatry", "Creation Date": "2020/03/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies with behavioural and neuropsychological tests have supported the developmental taxonomy theory of antisocial behaviour, which specifies abnormal brain development as a fundamental aspect of life-course-persistent antisocial behaviour, but\nno study has characterised features of brain structure associated with life-course-persistent versus adolescence-limited trajectories, as defined by prospective data. We aimed to determine whether life-course-persistent antisocial behaviour is associated with\nneurocognitive abnormalities by testing the hypothesis that it is also associated with brain structure abnormalities. METHODS: We used structural MRI data collected at 45 years of age from participants in\nthe Dunedin Study, a population-representative longitudinal birth cohort of 1037 individuals born between April 1, 1972, and March 31, 1973, in Dunedin, New Zealand, who were resident in the province\nand who participated in the first assessment at 3 years of age. Participants underwent MRI, and mean global cortical surface area and cortical thickness were extracted for each participant. Participants\nhad been previously subtyped as exhibiting life-course-persistent, adolescence-limited, or no history of persistent antisocial behaviour (ie, a low trajectory group) based on informant-reported and self-reported conduct problems from the ages\nof 7 years to 26 years. Study personnel who processed the MRI images were masked to antisocial group membership. We used linear estimated ordinary least squares regressions to compare each\nantisocial trajectory group (life-course persistent and adolescence limited) with the low trajectory group to examine whether antisocial behaviour was related to abnormalities in mean global surface area and mean cortical\nthickness. Next, we used parcel-wise linear regressions to identify antisocial trajectory group differences in surface area and cortical thickness. All results were controlled for sex and false discovery rate corrected.\nFINDINGS: Data from 672 participants were analysed, and 80 (12%) were classified as having life-course-persistent antisocial behaviour, 151 (23%) as having adolescence-limited antisocial behaviour, and 441 (66%) as having low\nantisocial behaviour. Individuals on the life-course-persistent trajectory had a smaller mean surface area (standardised beta=-0.18 [95% CI -0.24 to -0.11]; p<0.0001) and lower mean cortical thickness (standardised beta=-0.10 [95% CI\n-0.19 to -0.02]; p=0.020) than did those in the low group. Compared with the low group, the life-course-persistent group had reduced surface area in 282 of 360 anatomically defined parcels\nand thinner cortex in 11 of 360 parcels encompassing circumscribed frontal and temporal regions associated with executive function, affect regulation, and motivation. Widespread differences in brain surface morphometry were not\nobserved for the adolescence-limited group compared with either non-antisocial behaviour or life-course-persistent groups. INTERPRETATION: These analyses provide initial evidence that differences in brain surface morphometry are associated with life-course-persistent, but\nnot adolescence-limited, antisocial behaviour. As such, the analyses are consistent with the developmental taxonomy theory of antisocial behaviour and highlight the importance of using prospective longitudinal data to define different\npatterns of antisocial behaviour development.

HIV", "Creation Date": "2020/02/23 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 17", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current efficacy studies of a mosaic HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine require four vaccination visits over one year, which is a complex regimen that could prove challenging for vaccine delivery at\nthe community level, both for recipients and clinics. In this study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of shorter, simpler regimens of trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV expressing mosaic HIV-1 Env/Gag/Pol antigens\ncombined with aluminium phosphate-adjuvanted clade C gp140 protein. METHODS: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial (IPCAVD010/HPX1002) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA. We\nincluded healthy, HIV-uninfected participants (aged 18-50 years) who were considered at low risk for HIV infection and had not received any vaccines in the 14 days before study commencement. We\nrandomly assigned participants via a computer-generated randomisation schedule and interactive web response system to one of three study groups (1:1:1) testing different regimens of trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV (5 x 10(10) viral\nparticles per 0.5 mL) combined with 250 mug adjuvanted clade C gp140 protein. They were then assigned to treatment or placebo subgroups (5:1) within each of the three main groups.\nParticipants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation until the end of the follow-up period. Group 1 received Ad26.Mos.HIV alone at weeks 0 and 12 and Ad26.Mos.HIV plus adjuvanted gp140\nat weeks 24 and 48. Group 2 received Ad26.Mos.HIV plus adjuvanted gp140 at weeks 0, 12, and 24. Group 3 received Ad26.Mos.HIV alone at week 0 and Ad26.Mos.HIV plus adjuvanted\ngp140 at weeks 8 and 24. Participants in the control group received 0.5 mL of 0.9% saline. All study interventions were administered intramuscularly. The primary endpoints were Env-specific binding antibody\nresponses at weeks 28, 52, and 72 and safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimens for 28 days after the injection. All participants who received at least one vaccine dose\nor placebo were included in the safety analysis; immunogenicity was analysed using the per-protocol population. The IPCAVD010/HPX1002 trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02685020. We also did a parallel preclinical study\nin rhesus monkeys to test the protective efficacy of the shortened group 3 regimen. FINDINGS: Between March 7, 2016, and Aug 19, 2016, we randomly assigned 36 participants to receive\nat least one dose of study vaccine or placebo, ten to each vaccine group and two to the corresponding placebo group. 30 (83%) participants completed the full study, and six\n(17%) discontinued it prematurely because of loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, investigator decision, and an unrelated death from a motor vehicle accident. The two shortened regimens elicited comparable antibody\ntitres against autologous clade C Env at peak immunity to the longer, 12-month regimen: geometric mean titre (GMT) 41 007 (95% CI 17 959-93 636) for group 2 and 49\n243 (29 346-82 630) for group 3 at week 28 compared with 44 590 (19 345-102 781) for group 1 at week 52). Antibody responses remained increased (GMT >5000) in\ngroups 2 and 3 at week 52 but were highest in group 1 at week 72. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, Env-specific IgG3, tier 1A neutralising activity, and broad cellular immune responses\nwere detected in all groups. All vaccine regimens were well tolerated. Mild-to-moderate pain or tenderness at the injection site was the most commonly reported solicited local adverse event, reported by\n28 vaccine recipients (93%) and two placebo recipients (33%). Grade 3 solicited systemic adverse events were reported by eight (27%) vaccine recipients and no placebo recipients; the most commonly reported\ngrade 3 systemic symptoms were fatigue, myalgia, and chills. The shortened group 3 regimen induced comparable peak immune responses in 30 rhesus monkeys as in humans and resulted in an\n83% (95% CI 38.7-95, p=0.004 log-rank test) reduction in per-exposure acquisition risk after six intrarectal challenges with SHIV-SF162P3 at week 54, more than 6 months after final vaccination. INTERPRETATION: Short,\n6-month regimens of a mosaic HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine elicited robust HIV-specific immune responses that were similar to responses elicited by a longer, 12-month schedule. Preclinical data showed partial protective efficacy\nof one of the short vaccine regimens in rhesus monkeys. Further clinical studies are required to test the suitability of the shortened vaccine regimens in humans. Such shortened regimens would\nbe valuable to increase vaccine delivery at the community level, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Pharmacological\ninhibition of MET signalling and aberrant angiogenesis has shown promising results in several preclinical models of Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. We aimed to investigate the activity of cabozantinib, an inhibitor\nof MET and VEGFR2, in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. METHODS: We did a multicentre, single-arm, two-stage, phase 2 trial in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma or osteosarcoma\nrecruited from ten centres in the French Sarcoma Group. Key eligibility criteria were aged 12 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and documented disease progression\n(according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1) before study entry. The number of previous lines of treatment was not limited. Patients received cabozantinib (adults 60 mg, children\n[<16 years] 40 mg/m(2)) orally once daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, the investigator's decision to discontinue, or participant withdrawal. The primary endpoint for Ewing sarcoma was\nbest objective response within 6 months of treatment onset; for osteosarcoma, a dual primary endpoint of 6-month objective response and 6-month non-progression was assessed. All enrolled patients who received at\nleast one dose of cabozantinib were included in the safety analysis, and all participants who received at least one complete or two incomplete treatment cycles were included in the efficacy\npopulation. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02243605. FINDINGS: Between April 16, 2015, and July 12, 2018, 90 patients (45 with Ewing sarcoma 45 with osteosarcoma) were recruited to\nthe study. Median follow-up was 31.3 months (95% CI 12.4-35.4) for patients with Ewing sarcoma and 31.1 months (24.4-31.7) for patients with osteosarcoma. 39 (87%) patients with Ewing sarcoma and\n42 (93%) patients with osteosarcoma were assessable for efficacy after histological and radiological review. In patients with Ewing sarcoma, ten (26%; 95% CI 13-42) of 39 patients had an objective\nresponse (all partial responses) by 6 months; in patients with osteosarcoma, five (12%; 4-26) of 42 patients had an objective response (all partial responses) and 14 (33%; 20-50) had 6-month\nnon-progression. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypophosphataemia (five [11%] for Ewing sarcoma, three [7%] for osteosarcoma), aspartate aminotransferase increase (two [4%] for Ewing sarcoma, three\n[7%] for osteosarcoma), palmar-plantar syndrome (three [7%] for Ewing sarcoma, two [4%] for osteosarcoma), pneumothorax (one [2%] for Ewing sarcoma, four [9%] for osteosarcoma), and neutropenia (two [4%] for Ewing\nsarcoma, four [9%] for osteosarcoma). At least one serious adverse event was reported in 61 (68%) of 90 patients. No patients died from drug-related toxic effects. INTERPRETATION: Cabozantinib has antitumor\nactivity in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma and was generally well tolerated. Cabozantinib could represent a new therapeutic option in this setting, and deserves further investigation.

Objective: To determine whether 0.40 mg/kg of tenecteplase safely improves reperfusion before endovascular\nthrombectomy vs 0.25 mg/kg of tenecteplase in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial at 27 hospitals in Australia and 1 in New\nZealand using open-label treatment and blinded assessment of radiological and clinical outcomes. Patients were enrolled from December 2017 to July 2019 with follow-up until October 2019. Adult patients (N =\n300) with ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid, \\basilar, or middle cerebral artery were included less than 4.5 hours after symptom onset using standard intravenous thrombolysis\neligibility criteria. Interventions: Open-label tenecteplase at 0.40 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg; n = 150) or 0.25 mg/kg (maximum, 25 mg; n = 150) given as a bolus before endovascular thrombectomy.\nMain Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was reperfusion of greater than 50% of the involved ischemic territory prior to thrombectomy, assessed by consensus of 2 blinded neuroradiologists. Prespecified secondary\noutcomes were level of disability at day 90 (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score; range, 0-6); mRS score of 0 to 1 (freedom from disability) or no change from baseline at\n90 days; mRS score of 0 to 2 (functional independence) or no change from baseline at 90 days; substantial neurological improvement at 3 days; symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours;\nand all-cause death. Results: All 300 patients who were randomized (mean age, 72.7 years; 141 [47%] women) completed the trial. The number of participants with greater than 50% reperfusion of\nthe previously occluded vascular territory was 29 of 150 (19.3%) in the 0.40 mg/kg group vs 29 of 150 (19.3%) in the 0.25 mg/kg group (unadjusted risk difference, 0.0% [95%\nCI, -8.9% to -8.9%]; adjusted risk ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.66-1.61]; P = .89). Among the 6 secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences in any of the 4 functional\noutcomes between the 0.40 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg groups nor in all-cause deaths (26 [17%] vs 22 [15%]; unadjusted risk difference, 2.7% [95% CI, -5.6% to 11.0%]) or symptomatic intracranial\nhemorrhage (7 [4.7%] vs 2 [1.3%]; unadjusted risk difference, 3.3% [95% CI, -0.5% to 7.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke, a dose of 0.40\nmg/kg, compared with 0.25 mg/kg, of tenecteplase did not significantly improve cerebral reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy. The findings suggest that the 0.40-mg/kg dose of tenecteplase does not confer an\nadvantage over the 0.25-mg/kg dose in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke in whom endovascular thrombectomy is planned.

Here we show that-for mixed bacterial populations that colonize nutrient patches-either population outcompetes the other when low in relative abundance. This\ninversion of the competitive hierarchy is caused by active segregation and spatial exclusion within the patch: a small fast-moving population can outcompete a large fast-growing population by impeding its migration\ninto the patch, while a small fast-growing population can outcompete a large fast-moving population by expelling it from the initial contact area.

Using this methodology, we rapidly identify high-cycle-life charging protocols among 224 candidates in 16 days (compared with over 500 days using exhaustive search\nwithout early prediction), and subsequently validate the accuracy and efficiency of our optimization approach. Our closed-loop methodology automatically incorporates feedback from past experiments to inform future decisions and can be\ngeneralized to other applications in battery design and, more broadly, other scientific domains that involve time-intensive experiments and multi-dimensional design spaces.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32076218", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32076217", "Title": "Fundamental symmetry tested using antihydrogen.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/05 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32076217", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32075796", "Title": "Hip replacements: do public or private providers do better?", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/23 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 19", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075796", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32075795", "Title": "Public health within local government, six years on.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/29 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 19", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075795", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32075794", "Title": "Maternal and fetal outcomes following exposure to duloxetine in pregnancy: cohort study.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/29 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 19", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes following in utero exposure to duloxetine. DESIGN: Cohort study nested in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract for 2004-13. SETTING: Publicly\ninsured pregnancies in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women 18 to 55 years of age and their liveborn infants. INTERVENTIONS: Duloxetine exposure during the etiologically relevant time window, compared with\nno exposure to duloxetine, exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, exposure to venlafaxine, and exposure to duloxetine before but not during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Congenital malformations overall, cardiac malformations,\npreterm birth, small for gestational age infant, pre-eclampsia, and postpartum hemorrhage. RESULTS: Cohort sizes ranged from 1.3 to 4.1 million, depending on the outcome. The number of women exposed to\nduloxetine varied by cohort and exposure contrast and was around 2500-3000 for early pregnancy exposure and 900-950 for late pregnancy exposure. The base risk per 1000 unexposed women was 36.6\n(95% confidence interval 36.3 to 36.9) for congenital malformations overall, 13.7 (13.5 to 13.9) for cardiovascular malformations, 107.8 (107.3 to 108.3) for preterm birth, 20.4 (20.1 to 20.6) for small\nfor gestational age infant, 33.6 (33.3 to 33.9) for pre-eclampsia, and 23.3 (23.1 to 23.4) for postpartum hemorrhage. After adjustment for measured potential confounding variables, all baseline characteristics were well\nbalanced for all exposure contrasts. In propensity score adjusted analyses versus unexposed pregnancies, the relative risk was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.33) for congenital malformations overall and 1.29\n(0.99 to 1.68) for cardiovascular malformations. For preterm birth, the relative risk was 1.01 (0.92 to 1.10) for early exposure and 1.19 (1.04 to 1.37) for late exposure. For small\nfor gestational age infants the relative risks were 1.14 (0.92 to 1.41) and 1.20 (0.83 to 1.72) for early and late pregnancy exposure, respectively, and for pre-eclampsia they were 1.12\n(0.96 to 1.31) and 1.04 (0.80 to 1.35). The relative risk for postpartum hemorrhage was 1.53 (1.08 to 2.18). Results from sensitivity analyses were generally consistent with the findings from\nthe main analyses. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the evidence available to date, duloxetine is unlikely to be a major teratogen but may be associated with an increased risk of\npostpartum hemorrhage and a small increased risk of cardiac malformations. While continuing to monitor the safety of duloxetine as data accumulate over time, these potential small increases in risk of\nrelatively uncommon outcomes must be weighed against the benefits of treating depression and pain during pregnancy in a given patient.

DESIGN: Population based\ncohort study. SETTING: The UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: The study cohort included 104 605 children born from 1990 to 2016 whose mothers were prescribed one macrolide monotherapy (erythromycin,\nclarithromycin, or azithromycin) or one penicillin monotherapy from the fourth gestational week to delivery. Two negative control cohorts consisted of 82 314 children whose mothers were prescribed macrolides or penicillins\nbefore conception, and 53 735 children who were siblings of the children in the study cohort. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risks of any major malformations and system specific major malformations (nervous,\ncardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genital, and urinary) after macrolide or penicillin prescribing during the first trimester (four to 13 gestational weeks), second to third trimester (14 gestational weeks to birth), or any\ntrimester of pregnancy. Additionally, risks of cerebral palsy, epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. RESULTS: Major malformations were recorded in 186 of 8632 children (21.55 per 1000)\nwhose mothers were prescribed macrolides and 1666 of 95 973 children (17.36 per 1000) whose mothers were prescribed penicillins during pregnancy. Macrolide prescribing during the first trimester was associated with\nan increased risk of any major malformation compared with penicillin (27.65 v 17.65 per 1000, adjusted risk ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.03) and specifically cardiovascular malformations (10.60\nv 6.61 per 1000, 1.62, 1.05 to 2.51). Macrolide prescribing in any trimester was associated with an increased risk of genital malformations (4.75 v 3.07 per 1000, 1.58, 1.14 to\n2.19, mainly hypospadias). Erythromycin in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of any major malformation (27.39 v 17.65 per 1000, 1.50, 1.13 to 1.99). No statistically significant\nassociations were found for other system specific malformations or for neurodevelopmental disorders. Findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing macrolide antibiotics during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated\nwith an increased risk of any major malformation and specifically cardiovascular malformations compared with penicillin antibiotics. Macrolide prescribing in any trimester was associated with an increased risk of genital malformations.\nThese findings show that macrolides should be used with caution during pregnancy and if feasible alternative antibiotics should be prescribed until further research is available.

DESIGN: Systematic analysis. DATA SOURCE: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017. METHODS: Mortality and DALYs\nfrom chronic respiratory diseases were estimated from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 using DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. The estimated annual percentage change of the age standardised\nmortality rate was calculated using a generalised linear model with a Gaussian distribution. Mortality and DALYs were stratified according to the Socio-demographic index. The strength and direction of the association\nbetween the Socio-demographic index and mortality rate were measured using the Spearman rank order correlation. Risk factors for chronic respiratory diseases were analysed from exposure data. RESULTS: Between 1990 and\n2017, the total number of deaths due to chronic respiratorydiseases increased by 18.0%, from 3.32 (95% uncertainty interval 3.01 to 3.43) million in 1990 to 3.91 (3.79 to 4.04) million\nin 2017. The age standardised mortality rate of chronic respiratory diseases decreased by an average of 2.41% (2.28% to 2.55%) annually. During the 27 years, the annual decline in mortality\nrates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 2.36%, uncertainty interval 2.21% to 2.50%) and pneumoconiosis (2.56%, 2.44% to 2.68%) has been slow, whereas the mortality rate for interstitial lung disease\nand pulmonary sarcoidosis (0.97%, 0.92% to 1.03%) has increased. Reductions in DALYs for asthma and pneumoconiosis have been seen, but DALYs due to COPD, and interstitial lung disease and pulmonary\nsarcoidosis have increased. Mortality and the annual change in mortality rate due to chronic respiratory diseases varied considerably across 195 countries. Assessment of the factors responsible for regional variations in\nmortality and DALYs and the unequal distribution of improvements during the 27 years showed negative correlations between the Socio-demographic index and the mortality rates of COPD, pneumoconiosis, and asthma. Regions\nwith a low Socio-demographic index had the highest mortality and DALYs. Smoking remained the major risk factor for mortality due to COPD and asthma. Pollution from particulate matter was the\nmajor contributor to deaths from COPD in regions with a low Socio-demographic index. Since 2013, a high body mass index has become the principal risk factor for asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Regions\nwith a low Socio-demographic index had the greatest burden of disease. The estimated contribution of risk factors (such as smoking, environmental pollution, and a high body mass index) to mortality\nand DALYs supports the need for urgent efforts to reduce exposure to

summarise existing indices for measuring multimorbidity beyond disease counts, to establish which indices include mental health comorbidities or outcomes, and to develop recommendations based on applicability,\nperformance, and usage. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Seven medical research databases (Medline, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus) from inception to October\n2018 and bibliographies and citations of relevant papers. Searches were limited to English language publications. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: Original articles describing a new multimorbidity index including more information\nthan disease counts and not focusing on comorbidity associated with one specific disease. Studies were of adults based in the community or at population level. RESULTS: Among 7128 search results,\n5560 unique titles were identified. After screening against eligibility criteria the review finally included 35 papers. As index components, 25 indices used conditions (weighted or in combination with other parameters),\nfive used diagnostic categories, four used drug use, and one used physiological measures. Predicted outcomes included mortality (18 indices), healthcare use or costs (13), hospital admission (13), and health related\nquality of life (7). 29 indices considered some aspect of mental health, with most including it as a comorbidity. 12 indices are recommended for use. CONCLUSIONS: 35 multimorbidity indices are\navailable, with differing components and outcomes. Researchers and clinicians should examine existing indices for suitability before creating new ones.

epithelial ovarian cancer risk. Objective: To evaluate the association of genetically proxied inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A\n(HMG-CoA) reductase (ie, genetic variants related to lower function of HMG-CoA reductase, target of statins) with epithelial ovarian cancer among the general population and in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Design, Setting,\nand Participants: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis (N </=196475) were used to proxy therapeutic\ninhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), respectively. Summary statistics were obtained for these SNPs from a GWAS meta-analysis of case-control analyses\nof invasive epithelial ovarian cancer in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC; N = 63347) and from a GWAS meta-analysis of retrospective cohort analyses of epithelial ovarian cancer among BRCA1/2\nmutation carriers in the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA; N = 31448). Across the 2 consortia, participants were enrolled between 1973 and 2014 and followed up through\n2015. OCAC participants came from 14 countries and CIMBA participants came from 25 countries. SNPs were combined into multi-allelic models and mendelian randomization estimates representing lifelong inhibition of targets were\ngenerated using inverse-variance weighted random-effects models. Exposures: Primary exposure was genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and secondary exposures were genetically proxied inhibition of NPC1L1 and PCSK9 and genetically proxied\ncirculating LDL cholesterol levels. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall and histotype-specific invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (general population) and epithelial ovarian cancer (BRCA1/2 mutation carriers), measured as ovarian cancer odds (general\npopulation) and hazard ratio (BRCA1/2 mutation carriers). Results: The OCAC sample included 22406 women with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer and 40941 control individuals and the CIMBA sample included 3887 women\nwith epithelial ovarian cancer and 27561 control individuals. Median ages for the cohorts ranged from 41.5 to 59.0 years and all participants were of European ancestry. In the primary analysis,\ngenetically proxied HMG-CoA reductase inhibition equivalent to a 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol was associated with lower odds of epithelial ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.43-0.83];\nP = .002). In BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, genetically proxied HMG-CoA reductase inhibition was associated with lower ovarian cancer risk (hazard ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51-0.93]; P = .01). In secondary\nanalyses, there were no significant associations of genetically proxied inhibition of NPC1L1 (OR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.53-1.75]; P = .91), PCSK9 (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.85-1.13]; P = .80), or\ncirculating LDL cholesterol (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.91-1.05]; P = .55) with epithelial ovarian cancer. Conclusions and Relevance: Genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase was significantly associated with lower odds\nof epithelial ovarian cancer. However, these findings do not indicate risk reduction from medications that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase; further research is needed to understand whether there is a similar association\nwith such medications.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32068819", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32068818", "Title": "Predictive Accuracy of a Polygenic Risk Score-Enhanced Prediction Model vs a Clinical Risk Score for Coronary Artery Disease.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/05 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 18", "Abstract": "Importance: The incremental value of polygenic risk scores in addition to well-established risk prediction models for coronary artery disease (CAD) is uncertain. Objective: To examine whether a polygenic risk score\nfor CAD improves risk prediction beyond pooled cohort equations. Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational study of UK Biobank participants enrolled from 2006 to 2010. A case-control sample of 15947 prevalent\nCAD cases and equal number of age and sex frequency-matched controls was used to optimize the predictive performance of a polygenic risk score for CAD based on summary statistics from\npublished genome-wide association studies. A separate cohort of 352660 individuals (with follow-up to 2017) was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the polygenic risk score, pooled cohort equations, and\nboth combined for incident CAD. Exposures: Polygenic risk score for CAD, pooled cohort equations, and both combined. Main Outcomes and Measures: CAD (myocardial infarction and its related sequelae). Discrimination, calibration,\nand reclassification using a risk threshold of 7.5% were assessed. Results: In the cohort of 352660 participants (mean age, 55.9 years; 205297 women [58.2%]) used to evaluate the predictive accuracy\nof the examined models, there were 6272 incident CAD events over a median of 8 years of follow-up. CAD discrimination for polygenic risk score, pooled cohort equations, and both combined\nresulted in C statistics of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.62), 0.76 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.77), and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.79), respectively. The change in C statistic\nbetween the latter 2 models was 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.03). Calibration of the models showed overestimation of risk by pooled cohort equations, which was corrected after recalibration. Using\na risk threshold of 7.5%, addition of the polygenic risk score to pooled cohort equations resulted in a net reclassification improvement of 4.4% (95% CI, 3.5% to 5.3%) for cases\nand -0.4% (95% CI, -0.5% to -0.4%) for noncases (overall net reclassification improvement, 4.0% [95% CI, 3.1% to 4.9%]). Conclusions and Relevance: The addition of a polygenic risk score for\nCAD to pooled cohort equations was associated with a statistically significant, yet modest, improvement in the predictive accuracy for incident CAD and improved risk stratification for only a small proportion\nof individuals.

The performance of the polygenic risk score was compared with that of the 2013 American College of Cardiology\nand American Heart Association pooled cohort equations. Exposures: Genetic risk was computed for each participant by summing the product of the weights and allele dosage across 6630149 SNPs. Weights were\nbased on an international genome-wide association study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prediction of 10-year first CHD events (including myocardial infarctions, fatal coronary events, silent infarctions, revascularization procedures, or resuscitated cardiac\narrest) assessed using measures of model discrimination, calibration, and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Results: The study population included 4847 adults from the ARIC study (mean [SD] age, 62.9 [5.6] years;\n56.4% women) and 2390 adults from the MESA cohort (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [9.6] years; 52.2% women). Incident CHD events occurred in 696 participants (14.4%) and 227 participants (9.5%), respectively,\nover median follow-up of 15.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 6.3 years) and 14.2 (IQR, 2.5 years) years. The polygenic risk score was significantly associated with 10-year CHD incidence in ARIC\nwith hazard ratios per SD increment of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.34) and in MESA, 1.38 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.58). Addition of the polygenic risk score to the\npooled cohort equations did not significantly increase the C statistic in either cohort (ARIC, change in C statistic, -0.001; 95% CI, -0.009 to 0.006; MESA, 0.021; 95% CI, -0.0004 to\n0.043). At the 10-year risk threshold of 7.5%, the addition of the polygenic risk score to the pooled cohort equations did not provide significant improvement in reclassification in either ARIC\n(NRI, 0.018, 95% CI, -0.012 to 0.036) or MESA (NRI, 0.001, 95% CI, -0.038 to 0.076). The polygenic risk score did not significantly improve calibration in either cohort. Conclusions and\nRelevance: In this analysis of 2 cohorts of US adults, the polygenic risk score was associated with incident coronary heart disease events but did not significantly improve discrimination, calibration, or\nrisk reclassification compared with conventional predictors.

HIV prevention cascades have been proposed to assist in the implementation and monitoring of HIV prevention programmes\nby identifying gaps in the steps required for effective use of prevention methods, similar to HIV treatment cascades. However, lack of a unifying framework impedes widespread use of prevention cascades.\nBuilding on a series of consultations, we propose an HIV prevention cascade consisting of three key domains of motivation, access, and effective use in a priority population. This three-step cascade\ncan be used for routine monitoring and advocacy, particularly by attaching 90-90-90-style targets. Further characterisation of reasons for gaps across motivation, access, or effective use allows for a comprehensive framework,\nguiding identification of relevant responses and platforms for interventions.

Known technologies-such as solar cells, thermoelectric devices and mechanical generators-have specific environmental requirements that restrict where\nthey can be deployed and limit their potential for continuous energy production(3-5). The ubiquity of atmospheric moisture offers an alternative. However, existing moisture-based energy-harvesting technologies can produce only intermittent, brief\n(shorter than 50 seconds) bursts of power in the ambient environment, owing to the lack of a sustained conversion mechanism(6-12). Here we show that thin-film devices made from nanometre-scale protein\nwires harvested from the microbe Geobacter sulfurreducens can generate continuous electric power in the ambient environment. The devices produce a sustained voltage of around 0.5 volts across a 7-micrometre-thick film,\nwith a current density of around 17 microamperes per square centimetre.

We aimed to describe\nchronic health conditions and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among survivors of early-adolescent and young adult cancer. METHODS: The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a retrospective cohort study with longitudinal\nfollow-up of 5-year survivors diagnosed with cancer before the age of 21 years at 27 academic institutions in the USA and Canada between 1970 and 1999. We evaluated outcomes among\nsurvivors of early-adolescent and young adult cancer (aged 15-20 years at diagnosis) and survivors diagnosed at age younger than 15 years (matched on primary cancer diagnosis, including leukaemia, lymphoma, CNS\ntumours, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumour, soft-tissue sarcomas, and bone cancer) by comparing both groups to siblings of the same age. Mortality was ascertained with the National Death Index. Chronic health conditions\nwere classified with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated with age-specific, sex-specific, and calendar year-specific US rates. Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard\nratios (HRs) for chronic health conditions and 95% CIs. FINDINGS: Among 5804 early-adolescent and young adult survivors (median age 42 years, IQR 34-50) the SMR compared to the general population\nfor all-cause mortality was 5.9 (95% CI 5.5-6.2) and among 5804 childhood cancer survivors (median age 34 years; 27-42), it was 6.2 (5.8-6.6). Early-adolescent and young adult survivors had lower\nSMRs for death from health-related causes (ie, conditions that exclude recurrence or progression of the primary cancer and external causes, but include the late effects of cancer therapy) than did\nchildhood cancer survivors (SMR 4.8 [95% CI 4.4-5.1] vs 6.8 [6.2-7.4]), which was primarily evident more than 20 years after cancer diagnosis. Early-adolescent and young adult cancer survivors and childhood\ncancer survivors were both at greater risk of developing severe and disabling, life-threatening, or fatal (grade 3-5) health conditions than siblings of the same age (HR 4.2 [95% CI 3.7-4.8]\nfor early adolescent and young adult cancer survivors and 5.6 [4.9-6.3] for childhood cancer survivors), and at increased risk of developing grade 3-5 cardiac (4.3 [3.5-5.4] and 5.6 [4.5-7.1]), endocrine\n(3.9 [2.9-5.1] and 6.4 [5.1-8.0]), and musculoskeletal conditions (6.5 [3.9-11.1] and 8.0 [4.6-14.0]) when compared with siblings of the same age, although all these risks were lower for early-adolescent and\nyoung adult survivors than for childhood cancer survivors. INTERPRETATION: Early-adolescent and young adult cancer survivors had higher risks of mortality and severe and life threatening chronic health conditions than the\ngeneral population. However, early-adolescent and young adult cancer survivors had lower non-recurrent, health-related SMRs and relative risks of developing grade 3-5 chronic health conditions than childhood cancer survivors, by comparison\nwith siblings of the same age, which were most notable more than 20 years after their original cancer. These results highlight the need for long-term screening of both childhood and\nearly-adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.

The dedifferentiated subgroup shows an aggressive course with resistance to pazopanib, whereas in the malignant subgroup, pazopanib\nshows higher activity than in previous studies with chemotherapy. We designed a trial to test pazopanib activity in two different cohorts of solitary fibrous tumour: the malignant-dedifferentiated cohort, which was\npreviously published, and the typical cohort, which is presented here. METHODS: In this single-arm, phase 2 trial, adult patients (aged >/=18 years) diagnosed with confirmed metastatic or unresectable typical solitary\nfibrous tumour of any location, who had progressed in the previous 6 months (by Choi criteria or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group\n(ECOG) performance status of 0-2 were enrolled at 11 tertiary hospitals in Italy, France, and Spain. Patients received pazopanib 800 mg once daily, taken orally, until progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal\nof consent, non-compliance, or a delay in pazopanib administration of longer than 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients achieving an overall response measured by Choi criteria in\npatients who received at least 1 month of treatment with at least one radiological assessment. All patients who received at least one dose of the study drug were included in\nthe safety analyses. This study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02066285, and with the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT 2013-005456-15. FINDINGS: From June 26, 2014, to Dec 13, 2018, of 40\npatients who were assessed, 34 patients were enrolled and 31 patients were included in the response analysis. Median follow-up was 18 months (IQR 14-34), and 18 (58%) of 31 patients\nhad a partial response, 12 (39%) had stable disease, and one (3%) showed progressive disease according to Choi criteria and central review. The proportion of overall response based on Choi\ncriteria was 58% (95% CI 34-69). There were no deaths caused by toxicity, and the most frequent adverse events were diarrhoea (18 [53%] of 34 patients), fatigue (17 [50%]), and\nhypertension (17 [50%]). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective trial of pazopanib for advanced typical solitary fibrous tumour. The manageable toxicity and activity shown by pazopanib in\nthis cohort suggest that this drug could be considered as first-line treatment for advanced typical solitary fibrous tumour.

Acute ovarian failure is defined as the permanent loss of ovarian function within 5 years of cancer diagnosis. We aimed to develop and\nvalidate risk prediction tools to provide accurate clinical guidance for paediatric patients with cancer. METHODS: In this cohort study, prediction models of acute ovarian failure risk were developed using eligible\nfemale US and Canadian participants in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort and validated in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) Study. 5-year survivors from the CCSS cohort were\nincluded if they were at least 18 years old at their most recent follow-up and had complete treatment exposure and adequate menstrual history (including age at menarche, current menstrual status,\nage at last menstruation, and menopausal aetiology) information available. Participants in the SJLIFE cohort were at least 10-year survivors. Participants were excluded from the prediction analysis if they had an\novarian hormone deficiency, had missing exposure information, or had indeterminate ovarian status. The outcome of acute ovarian failure was defined as permanent loss of ovarian function within 5 years of\ncancer diagnosis or no menarche after cancer treatment by the age of 18 years. Logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines were used as candidate methods to develop the\nrisk prediction models in the CCSS cohort. Prediction performance was evaluated internally (in the CCSS cohort) and externally (in the SJLIFE cohort) using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve (AUC) and the precision-recall curve (average precision [AP; average positive predictive value]). FINDINGS: Data from the CCSS cohort were collected for participants followed up between Nov 3, 1992, and\nNov 25, 2016, and from the SJLIFE cohort for participants followed up between Oct 17, 2007, and April 16, 2012. Of 11 336 female CCSS participants, 5886 (51.9%) met all\ninclusion criteria for analysis. 1644 participants were identified from the SJLIFE cohort, of whom 875 (53.2%) were eligible for analysis. 353 (6.0%) of analysed CCSS participants and 50 (5.7%) of\nanalysed SJLIFE participants had acute ovarian failure. The overall median follow-up for the CCSS cohort was 23.9 years (IQR 20.4-27.9), and for SJLIFE it was 23.9 years (19.0-30.0). The three\ncandidate methods (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines) yielded similar results, and a prescribed dose model with abdominal and pelvic radiation doses and an ovarian dose model with\novarian radiation dosimetry using logistic regression were selected. Common predictors in both models were history of haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, cumulative alkylating drug dose, and an interaction between age at cancer\ndiagnosis and haematopoietic stem-cell transplant. External validation of the model in the SJLIFE cohort produced an estimated AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.98) and AP of 0.68 (95% CI 0.53-0.81)\nfor the ovarian dose model, and AUC of 0.96 (0.94-0.97) and AP of 0.46 (0.34-0.61) for the prescribed dose model. Based on these models, an online risk calculator has been\ndeveloped for clinical use. INTERPRETATION: Both acute ovarian failure risk prediction models performed well. The ovarian dose model is preferred if ovarian radiation dosimetry is available. The models, along with\nthe online risk calculator, could help clinical discussions regarding the need for fertility preservation interventions in girls and young women newly diagnosed with cancer.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous reslizumab 110 mg in two trials in\npatients with uncontrolled severe asthma and increased blood eosinophils. The aim was to establish whether subcutaneous reslizumab 110 mg can reduce exacerbation rates in these patients (study 1) or reduce\nmaintenance oral corticosteroid dose in patients with corticosteroid-dependent asthma (study 2). METHODS: Both studies were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies. Entry criteria for study 1 were uncontrolled severe asthma,\ntwo or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year, a blood eosinophil count of 300 cells per muL or more (including no more than 30% patients with an eosinophil count\n<400 cells/muL), and at least a medium dose of inhaled corticosteroids with one or more additional asthma controllers. Patients in study 2 had severe asthma, a blood eosinophil count of\n300 cells per muL or more, daily maintenance oral corticosteroid (prednisone 5-40 mg, or equivalent), and high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another controller. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to subcutaneous reslizumab\n(110 mg) or placebo once every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in study 1 and 24 weeks in study 2. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Primary efficacy\noutcomes were frequency of exacerbations during 52 weeks in study 1 and categorised percentage reduction in daily oral corticosteroid dose from baseline to weeks 20-24 in study 2. Primary efficacy\nanalyses were by intention to treat, and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02452190 (study 1)\nand NCT02501629 (study 2). FINDINGS: Between Aug 12, 2015, and Jan 31, 2018, 468 patients in study 1 were randomly assigned to placebo (n=232) or subcutaneous reslizumab (n=236), and 177\nin study 2 to placebo (n=89) or subcutaneous reslizumab (n=88). In study 1, we found no significant difference in the exacerbation rate between reslizumab and placebo in the intention-to-treat population\n(rate ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.56-1.12; p=0.19). Subcutaneous reslizumab reduced exacerbation frequency compared with placebo in the subgroup of patients with blood eosinophil counts of 400 cells per muL or\nmore (0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.95). Greater reductions in annual exacerbation risk (p=0.0035) and longer time to first exacerbation were observed for patients with higher trough serum reslizumab concentrations. In study\n2, we found no difference between placebo and fixed-dose subcutaneous reslizumab in categorised percentage reduction in daily oral corticosteroid dose (odds ratio for a lower category of oral corticosteroid use\nin the reslizumab group vs the placebo group, 1.23, 95% CI 0.70-2.16; p=0.47). The frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events with reslizumab were similar to those with placebo\nin both studies. INTERPRETATION: Fixed-dose (110 mg) subcutaneous reslizumab was not effective in reducing exacerbation frequency in patients with uncontrolled asthma and increased blood eosinophils (>/=300 cells/muL), or in reducing\nthe daily maintenance oral corticosteroid dose in patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent severe eosinophilic asthma. Higher exposures than those observed with 110 mg subcutaneous reslizumab are required to achieve maximal efficacy.\nFUNDING: Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32066536", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32066535", "Title": "Evolution of e-cigarettes: vigilance is needed to protect adolescent health.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

We assessed the performance of Ultra compared with Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) in an HIV-endemic setting where\nprevious tuberculosis is frequent and current test performance is suboptimal. METHODS: In this two-cohort diagnostic accuracy study, we used sputum samples from patients in South Africa to evaluate the accuracy\nof Ultra and Xpert against a single culture reference standard. For the first cohort (cohort A), we recruited adults (aged >/=18 years) with symptoms of presumptive tuberculosis at Scottsdene clinic\nin Cape Town, South Africa. We collected three sputum samples from each patient in cohort A, two at the first visit of which one was tested using Xpert and the\nother was tested using culture, and one sample the next morning which was tested using Ultra. In a separate cohort of patients with presumptive tuberculosis and recent previous tuberculosis (</=2\nyears) who had submitted sputum samples to the National Health Laboratory Services (cohort B), decontaminated sediments were, after processing, randomly allocated (1:1) for testing with Ultra or Xpert. For both\ncohorts we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of Ultra and Xpert and evaluated the effects of different methods of interpreting Ultra trace results. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2016, and Feb\n2, 2018, we recruited 302 people into cohort A, all of whom provided sputum samples and 239 were included in the head-to-head analyses of Ultra and Xpert. For cohort B,\nwe collected sputum samples from eligible patients who had submitted samples between Dec 6, 2016, and Dec 21, 2017, to give a cohort of 831 samples, of which 352 were\neligible for inclusion in analyses and randomly assigned to Ultra (n=173) or Xpert (n=179). In cohort A, Ultra gave more non-actionable results (not positive or negative) than did Xpert (28\n[10%] 275 vs 14 [5%] 301; p=0.011). In the head-to-head analysis, in smear-negative patients, sensitivity of Ultra was 80% (95% CI 64-90) and of Xpert was 73% (57-85; p=0.45). Overall,\nspecificity of Ultra was lower than that of Xpert (90% [84-94] vs 99% [95-100]; p=0.001). In cohort B, overall sensitivity was 92% (81-98) for Xpert versus 86% (73-95; p=0.36) for\nUltra and overall specificity was 69% (60-77) for Ultra versus 84% (78-91; p=0.005) for Xpert. Ultra specificity estimates improved after reclassification of results with the lowest Ultra-positive semiquantitation category (trace)\nto negative (15% [8-22]). In cohort A, the positive predictive value (PPV) for Ultra was 78% (67-87) and for Xpert was 96% (87-99; p=0.004); in cohort B, the PPV for\nUltra was 50% (43-57) and for Xpert was 70% (61-78; p=0.014). Ultra PPV estimates in previously treated patients were low: at 15% tuberculosis prevalence, half of Ultra-positive patients with presumptive\ntuberculosis would be culture negative, increasing to approximately 70% in patients with recent previous tuberculosis. In cohort B, 21 (28%) of 76 samples that were Ultra positive were rifampicin indeterminate\n(all trace) and, like cohort A, most were culture negative (19 [90%] of 21). INTERPRETATION: In a setting with a high burden of previous tuberculosis, Ultra generated more non-actionable results\nand had diminished specificity compared with Xpert. In patients with recent previous tuberculosis, a quarter of Ultra-positive samples were indeterminate for rifampicin resistance and culture negative, suggesting that additional drug-resistance\ntesting will probably be unsuccessful.

Mobility-driven transmission can result in source-sink dynamics: one community\ncan sustain a micro-epidemic in another community in which transmission is too low to be self-sustaining. In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (R0) is used to specify the sustainability threshold.\nR0 represents the average number of secondary infections generated by one infected individual in a community in which everyone is susceptible. If R0 is greater than 1, transmission is high\nenough to sustain an epidemic; if R0 is less than 1, it is not. Here, we discuss the conditions that are needed (in terms of R0) for source-sink transmission dynamics\nto occur in generalised HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, present an example of where these conditions could occur (ie, Namibia), and discuss the necessity of considering mobility-driven transmission when designing\ncontrol strategies. Additionally, we discuss the need for a new generation of HIV transmission models that are more realistic than the current models. The new models should reflect not only\ngeographical variation in epidemiology and demography, but also the spatial-temporal complexity of population-level movement patterns.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32066532", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32066531", "Title": "Colorectal cancer in Crohn's disease: closing the gap.", "JournalName": "The lancet.

Gastroenterology & hepatology", "Creation Date": "2020/02/19 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 13", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, available studies reflect older treatment and surveillance strategies, and most have assessed risks for incident CRC without taking\nsurveillance and lead-time bias into account. Such biases can be accounted for by assessing CRC incidence by tumour stage and CRC mortality by tumour stage. We aimed to assess rates\nof incident CRC and CRC mortality among patients with Crohn's disease compared with the general population. METHODS: For this nationwide register-based cohort study, we used International Classification of Disease codes\nin national patient registers and pathology reports to identify incident cases of Crohn's disease. In Denmark we searched for incident cases between January, 1977, and December, 2011, and in Sweden\nbetween January, 1969, and December, 2017. For each patient with Crohn's disease, we identified up to ten reference individuals in national population registers and matched them by sex, age, calendar\nyear, and place of residence. Matched reference individuals had to be alive and free of inflammatory bowel disease at the start of follow-up of index patients with Crohn's disease, and\nstopped contributing to reference person-years if they were diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. Our main outcome was death from CRC (main or contributory cause of death) as captured in the\ncause-of-death registers. Our secondary outcome was incident CRC, as defined by the cancer registers. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for incident CRC and CRC mortality, taking\ntumour stage into account. We used a series of Cox models to estimate cause-specific HRs of the different competing outcomes (CRC diagnosis, CRC death, and other causes of death) and\nadjusted for tumour stage at CRC diagnosis. FINDINGS: During the 1969-2017 study period, we identified 47 035 patients with incident Crohn's disease (13 056 in Denmark and 33 979 in\nSweden) and 463 187 matched reference individuals. During follow-up, 296 (0.47 per 1000 person-years) CRC deaths occurred among individuals with Crohn's disease compared with 1968 (0.31 per 1000 person-years) in\nreference individuals, corresponding to an overall adjusted HR of 1.74 (1.54-1.96). 499 (0.82 per 1000 person-years) cases of incident CRC were diagnosed in patients with Crohn's disease compared with 4084\n(0.64 per 1000 person-years) cases in reference individuals, corresponding to an overall adjusted HR of 1.40 (95% CI 1.27-1.53). Patients with Crohn's disease who were diagnosed with CRC were at\nincreased risk of CRC mortality compared with reference individuals also diagnosed with CRC (HR 1.42 [1.16-1.75] when adjusted for tumour stage), and tumour stage at CRC diagnosis did not differ\nbetween groups (p=0.27). Patients with Crohn's disease who had follow-up of 8 years or longer or who were diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and hence were potentially eligible for\nCRC surveillance had an increased overall risk of CRC death (HR 1.40 [1.16-1.68]) or CRC diagnosis (HR 1.12 [0.98-1.28]). However, in patients potentially eligible for CRC surveillance we only found\nsignificantly increased risks in patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease before the age of 40 years, patients with disease activity in the colon only, or patients with PSC. INTERPRETATION: Patients with\nCrohn's disease are at increased risk of CRC diagnosis and CRC death. Patients with Crohn's disease who have CRC have a higher mortality than patients without Crohn's disease who are\nalso diagnosed with CRC. CRC surveillance should likely be focused on patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease before the age of 40 years, on patients with colon inflammation, and on those\nwho have PSC.

We estimated the association of the Brazilian conditional cash transfer programme, the Programa Bolsa Familia\n(PBF), on leprosy treatment adherence and cure in patients in Brazil. METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, we linked baseline demographic and socioeconomic information for individuals who entered the 100 Million\nBrazilian Cohort between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2014, with the PBF payroll database and the Information System for Notifiable Diseases, which includes nationwide leprosy registries. Individuals were eligible\nfor inclusion if they had a household member older than 15 years and had not received PBF aid or been diagnosed with leprosy before entering the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort;\nthey were excluded if they were partial receivers of PBF benefits, had missing data, or had a monthly per-capita income greater than BRL200 (US$50). Individuals who were PBF beneficiaries before\nleprosy diagnosis were matched to those who were not beneficiaries through propensity-score matching (1:1) with replacement on the basis of baseline covariates, including sex, age, race or ethnicity, education, work,\nincome, place of residence, and household characteristics. We used logistic regression to assess the average treatment effect on the treated of receipt of PBF benefits on leprosy treatment adherence (six\nor more multidrug therapy doses for paucibacillary cases or 12 or more doses for multibacillary cases) and cure in individuals of all ages. We stratified our analysis according to operational\ndisease classification (paucibacillary or multibacillary). We also did a subgroup analysis of paediatric leprosy restricted to children aged up to 15 years. FINDINGS: We included 11 456 new leprosy cases,\nof whom 8750 (76.3%) had received PBF before diagnosis and 2706 (23.6%) had not. Overall, 9508 (83.0%) patients adhered to treatment and 10 077 (88.0%) were cured. After propensity score\nmatching, receiving PBF before diagnosis was associated with adherence to treatment (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.48) and cure (1.26, 1.01-1.58). PBF receipt did not significantly improve treatment adherence (1.37, 0.98-1.91)\nor cure (1.12, 0.75-1.67) in patients with paucibacillary leprosy. For patients with multibacillary disease, PBF beneficiaries had better treatment adherence (1.37, 1.08-1.74) and cure (1.43, 1.09-1.90) than non-beneficiaries. In the\npropensity score-matched analysis in 2654 children younger than 15 years with leprosy, PBF exposure was not associated with leprosy treatment adherence (1.55, 0.89-2.68) or cure (1.57, 0.83-2.97). INTERPRETATION: Our results\nsuggest that being a beneficiary of the PBF, which facilitates cash transfers and improved access to health care, is associated with greater leprosy multidrug therapy adherence and cure in multibacillary\ncases. These results are especially relevant for patients with multibacillary disease, who are treated for a longer period and have lower cure rates than those with paucibacillary disease.

Recently, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) motifs have become\nvaluable as pharmaceutical bioisosteres of benzene rings, and in particular 1,3-disubstituted BCP moieties have become widely adopted in medicinal chemistry as para-phenyl ring replacements(2). These structures are often generated from\n[1.1.1]propellane via opening of the internal C-C bond through the addition of either radicals or metal-based nucleophiles(3-13). The resulting propellane-addition adducts are then transformed to the requisite polysubstituted BCP compounds\nvia a range of synthetic sequences that traditionally involve multiple chemical steps. Although this approach has been effective so far, a multicomponent reaction that enables single-step access to complex and\ndiverse polysubstituted BCP products would be more time efficient compared to current stepwise approaches. Here we report a one-step three-component radical coupling of [1.1.1]propellane to afford diverse functionalized bicyclopentanes using\nvarious radical precursors and heteroatom nucleophiles via a metallaphotoredox catalysis protocol. This copper-mediated reaction operates on short timescales (five minutes to one hour) across multiple (more than ten) nucleophile classes\nand can accommodate a diverse array of radical precursors, including those that generate alkyl, alpha-acyl, trifluoromethyl and sulfonyl radicals. This method has been used to rapidly prepare BCP analogues of\nknown pharmaceuticals, one of which is substantially more metabolically stable than its commercial progenitor.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32066140", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32065831", "Title": "Effect of Intravenous Interferon beta-1a on Death and Days Free From Mechanical Ventilation Among Patients With Moderate to Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/18 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 17", "Abstract": "Importance: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high mortality.

The radiological and partial pressure of oxygen, arterial (Pao2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) criteria for\nARDS had to be met within a 24-hour period, and the administration of the first dose of the study drug had to occur within 48 hours of the diagnosis of\nARDS.

Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous injection of 10 mug of IFN-beta-1a (144 patients) or placebo (152 patients)\nonce daily for 6 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a score combining death and number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (score ranged from -1 for\ndeath to 27 if the patient was off ventilator on the first day). There were 16 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality, which were tested hierarchically to control type I error.\nResults: Among 301 patients who were randomized (mean age, 58 years; 103 women [34.2%]), 296 (98.3%) completed the trial and were included in the primary analysis.

Exposures: POLST order for medical interventions (\"comfort\nmeasures only\" vs \"limited additional interventions\" vs \"full treatment\"), age, race/ethnicity, education, days from POLST completion to admission, histories of cancer or dementia, and admission for traumatic injury.

This study aimed to re-examine the hypothesis that airways are spared in IPF using a multiresolution imaging protocol that combines multidetector CT (MDCT), with micro-CT and histology.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study comparing explanted lungs from patients with severe IPF treated by lung transplantation with a cohort of unused donor (control) lungs. The donor control\nlungs had no known lung disease, comorbidities, or structural lung injury, and were deemed appropriate for transplantation on review of the clinical files. The diagnosis of IPF in the lungs\nfrom patients was established by a multidisciplinary consensus committee according to existing guidelines, and was confirmed by video-assisted thoracic surgical biopsy or by pathological examination of the contralateral lung. The\ncontrol and IPF groups were matched for age, sex, height, and bodyweight. Samples of lung tissue were compared using the multiresolution imaging approach: a cascade of clinical MDCT, micro-CT, and\nhistological imaging. We did two experiments: in experiment 1, all the lungs were randomly sampled; in experiment 2, samples were selected from regions of minimal and established fibrosis. The patients\nand donors were recruited from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) and the University of Pennsylvania Hospital (Philadelphia, PA, USA). The study took place at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, and\nthe University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC, Canada). FINDINGS: Between Oct 5, 2009, and July 22, 2016, explanted lungs from patients with severe IPF (n=11), were compared with a cohort\nof unused donor (control) lungs (n=10), providing 240 samples of lung tissue for comparison using the multiresolution imaging approach. The MDCT specimen scans show that the number of visible airways\nlocated between the ninth generation (control 69 [SD 22] versus patients with IPF 105 [33], p=0.0023) and 14th generation (control 9 [6] versus patients with IPF 49 [28], p<0.0001) of\nairway branching are increased in patients with IPF, which we show by micro-CT is due to thickening of their walls and distortion of their lumens. The micro-CT analysis showed that\ncompared with healthy (control) lung anatomy (mean 5.6 terminal bronchioles per mL [SD 1.6]), minimal fibrosis in IPF tissue was associated with a 57% loss of the terminal bronchioles (mean\n2.4 terminal bronchioles per mL [SD 1.0]; p<0.0001), the appearance of fibroblastic foci, and infiltration of the tissue by inflammatory immune cells capable of forming lymphoid follicles. Established fibrosis in\nIPF tissue had a similar reduction (66%) in the number of terminal bronchioles (mean 1.9 terminal bronchioles per mL [SD 1.4]; p<0.0001) and was dominated by increased airspace size, Ashcroft\nfibrosis score, and volume fractions of tissue and collagen. INTERPRETATION: Small airways disease is a feature of IPF, with significant loss of terminal bronchioles occuring within regions of minimal fibrosis.\nOn the basis of these findings, we postulate that the small airways could become a potential therapeutic target in IPF.

With increasing use of biological therapies, contemporary\ndata on IBD health-care costs are important for those responsible for allocating resources in Europe. To our knowledge, no prospective long-term analysis of the health-care costs of patients with IBD\nin the era of biologicals has been done in Europe. We aimed to investigate cost profiles of a pan-European, community-based inception cohort during 5 years of follow-up. METHODS: The Epi-IBD\ncohort is a community-based, prospective inception cohort of unselected patients with IBD diagnosed in 2010 at centres in 20 European countries plus Israel. Incident patients who were diagnosed with IBD\naccording to the Copenhagen Diagnostic Criteria between Jan 1, and Dec 31, 2010, and were aged 15 years or older the time of diagnosis were prospectively included. Data on clinical\ncharacteristics and direct costs (investigations and outpatient visits, blood tests, treatments, hospitalisations, and surgeries) were collected prospectively using electronic case-report forms. Patient-level costs incorporated procedures leading to the initial diagnosis\nof IBD and costs of IBD management during the 5-year follow-up period. Costs incurred by comorbidities and unrelated to IBD were excluded. We grouped direct costs into the following five\ncategories: investigations (including outpatient visits and blood tests), conventional medical treatment, biological therapy, hospitalisation, and surgery. FINDINGS: The study population consisted of 1289 patients with IBD, with 1073 (83%) patients\nfrom western Europe and 216 (17%) from eastern Europe. 488 (38%) patients had Crohn's disease, 717 (56%) had ulcerative colitis, and 84 (6%) had IBD unclassified. The mean cost per\npatient-year during follow-up for patients with IBD was euro2609 (SD 7389; median euro446 [IQR 164-1849]). The mean cost per patient-year during follow-up was euro3542 (8058; median euro717 [214-3512]) for patients\nwith Crohn's disease, euro2088 (7058; median euro408 [133-1161]) for patients with ulcerative colitis, and euro1609 (5010; median euro415 [92-1228]) for patients with IBD unclassified (p<0.0001). Costs were highest in the\nfirst year and then decreased significantly during follow-up. Hospitalisations and diagnostic procedures accounted for more than 50% of costs during the first year. However, in subsequent years there was a\nsteady increase in expenditure on biologicals, which accounted for 73% of costs in Crohn's disease and 48% in ulcerative colitis, in year 5. The mean annual cost per patient-year for\nbiologicals was euro866 (SD 3056). The mean yearly costs of biological therapy were higher in patients with Crohn's disease (euro1782 [SD 4370]) than in patients with ulcerative colitis (euro286 [1427])\nor IBD unclassified (euro521 [2807]; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Overall direct expenditure on health care decreased over a 5-year follow-up period. This period was characterised by increasing expenditure on biologicals and decreasing\nexpenditure on conventional medical treatments, hospitalisations, and surgeries. In light of the expenditures associated with biological therapy, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed to reduce the economic burden of inflammatory bowel\ndisease.

We aimed to develop a network transmission model, calibrated to capture age-specific and sex-specific gaps in the scale-up of ART, to estimate the historical\nand future effect of attaining and surpassing the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets on HIV-1 incidence and mortality, and to assess whether these interventions will be enough to achieve epidemic control\n(incidence of 1 infection per 1000 person-years) by 2030. METHODS: We used eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) as a case study to develop our model. We used data on HIV prevalence by\n5-year age bins, sex, and year from the 2007 Swaziland Demographic Health Survey (SDHS), the 2011 Swaziland HIV Incidence Measurement Survey, and the 2016 Swaziland Population Health Impact Assessment (PHIA)\nsurvey. We estimated the point prevalence of ART coverage among all HIV-infected individuals by age, sex, and year. Age-specific data on the prevalence of male circumcision from the SDHS and\nPHIA surveys were used as model inputs for traditional male circumcision and scale-up of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). We calibrated our model using publicly available data on demographics; HIV\nprevalence by 5-year age bins, sex, and year; and ART coverage by age, sex, and year. We modelled the effects of five scenarios (historical scale-up of ART and VMMC [status\nquo], no ART or VMMC, no ART, age-targeted 90-90-90, and 100% ART initiation) to quantify the contribution of ART scale-up to declines in HIV incidence and mortality in individuals aged\n15-49 by 2016, 2030, and 2050. FINDINGS: Between 2010 and 2016, status-quo ART scale-up among adults (aged 15-49 years) in eSwatini (from 34.0% in 2010 to 74.1% in 2016) reduced\nHIV incidence by 43.57% (95% credible interval 39.71 to 46.36) and HIV mortality by 56.17% (54.06 to 58.92) among individuals aged 15-49 years, with larger reductions in incidence among men\nand mortality among women. Holding 2016 ART coverage levels by age and sex into the future, by 2030 adult HIV incidence would fall to 1.09 (0.87 to 1.29) per 100\nperson-years, 1.42 (1.13 to 1.71) per 100 person-years among women and 0.79 (0.63 to 0.94) per 100 person-years among men. Achieving the 90-90-90 targets evenly by age and sex would\nfurther reduce incidence beyond status-quo ART, primarily among individuals aged 15-24 years (an additional 17.37% [7.33 to 26.12] reduction between 2016 and 2030), with only modest additional incidence reductions in\nadults aged 35-49 years (1.99% [-5.09 to 7.74]). Achieving 100% ART initiation among all people living with HIV within an average of 6 months from infection-an upper bound of plausible\ntreatment effect-would reduce adult HIV incidence to 0.73 infections (0.55 to 0.92) per 100 person-years by 2030 and 0.46 (0.33 to 0.59) per 100 person-years by 2050. INTERPRETATION: Scale-up of\nART over the last decade has already contributed to substantial reductions in HIV-1 incidence and mortality in eSwatini. Focused ART targeting would further reduce incidence, especially in younger individuals, but\neven the most aggressive treatment campaigns would be insufficient to end the epidemic in high-burden settings without a renewed focus on expanding preventive measures.

We\nestimated the global, regional, and national burden of CKD, as well as the burden of cardiovascular disease and gout attributable to impaired kidney function, for the Global Burden of Diseases,\nInjuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017. We use the term CKD to refer to the morbidity and mortality that can be directly attributed to all stages of CKD, and we\nuse the term impaired kidney function to refer to the additional risk of CKD from cardiovascular disease and gout. METHODS: The main data sources we used were published literature, vital\nregistration systems, end-stage kidney disease registries, and household surveys. Estimates of CKD burden were produced using a Cause of Death Ensemble model and a Bayesian meta-regression analytical tool, and included\nincidence, prevalence, years lived with disability, mortality, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). A comparative risk assessment approach was used to estimate the proportion of cardiovascular diseases and\ngout burden attributable to impaired kidney function. FINDINGS: Globally, in 2017, 1.2 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.2 to 1.3) people died from CKD. The global all-age mortality rate from\nCKD increased 41.5% (95% UI 35.2 to 46.5) between 1990 and 2017, although there was no significant change in the age-standardised mortality rate (2.8%, -1.5 to 6.3). In 2017, 697.5\nmillion (95% UI 649.2 to 752.0) cases of all-stage CKD were recorded, for a global prevalence of 9.1% (8.5 to 9.8). The global all-age prevalence of CKD increased 29.3% (95%\nUI 26.4 to 32.6) since 1990, whereas the age-standardised prevalence remained stable (1.2%, -1.1 to 3.5). CKD resulted in 35.8 million (95% UI 33.7 to 38.0) DALYs in 2017, with\ndiabetic nephropathy accounting for almost a third of DALYs. Most of the burden of CKD was concentrated in the three lowest quintiles of Socio-demographic Index (SDI). In several regions, particularly\nOceania, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, the burden of CKD was much higher than expected for the level of development, whereas the disease burden in western, eastern, and central sub-Saharan\nAfrica, east Asia, south Asia, central and eastern Europe, Australasia, and western Europe was lower than expected. 1.4 million (95% UI 1.2 to 1.6) cardiovascular disease-related deaths and 25.3 million\n(22.2 to 28.9) cardiovascular disease DALYs were attributable to impaired kidney function. INTERPRETATION: Kidney disease has a major effect on global health, both as a direct cause of global morbidity\nand mortality and as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. CKD is largely preventable and treatable and deserves greater attention in global health policy decision making, particularly in locations\nwith low and middle SDI.

Neurology", "Creation Date": "2020/02/16 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral treatment options for disease-modifying therapy in relapsing multiple sclerosis have substantially increased over the past decade with four approved oral compounds now available: fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, and\ncladribine. Although these immunomodulating therapies are all orally administered, and thus convenient for patients, they have different modes of action. These distinct mechanisms of action allow better adaption of treatments\naccording to individual comorbidities and offer different mechanisms of treatment such as inhibition of immune cell trafficking versus immune cell depletion, thereby substantially expanding the available treatment options. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:\nNew sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulators with more specific S1PR target profiles and potentially better safety profiles compared with fingolimod were tested in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. For example, siponimod,\nwhich targets S1PR1 and S1PR5, was approved in March, 2019, by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis including active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.\nOzanimod, another S1P receptor modulator in the approval stage that also targets S1PR1 and S1PR5, reduced relapse rates and MRI activity in two phase 3 trials of patients with relapsing\nmultiple sclerosis. Blocking of matrix metalloproteinases or tyrosine kinases are novel modes of action in the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis, which are exhibited by minocycline and evobrutinib, respectively. Minocycline\nreduced conversion to multiple sclerosis in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome. Evobrutinib reduced MRI activity in a phase 2 trial, and a phase 3 trial is underway, in patients\nwith relapsing multiple sclerosis. Diroximel fumarate is metabolised to monomethyl fumarate, the active metabolite of dimethyl fumarate, reduces circulating lymphocytes and modifies the activation profile of monocytes, and is being\ntested in this disease with the aim to improve gastrointestinal tolerability. The oral immunomodulator laquinimod did not reach the primary endpoint of reduction in confirmed disability progression in a phase\n3 trial of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In a phase 2 trial of patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, laquinimod also did not reach the primary endpoint of a\nreduction in brain volume loss, as a consequence the development of this drug will probably not be continued in multiple sclerosis. WHERE NEXT?: Several new oral compounds are in late-stage\nclinical development. With new modes of action introduced to the treatment of multiple sclerosis, the question of how to select and sequence different treatments in individual patients arises. Balancing risks\nwith the expected efficacy of disease-modifying therapies will still be key for treatment selection. However, risks as well as efficacy can change when moving from the controlled clinical trial setting\nto clinical practice. Because some oral treatments, such as cladribine, have long-lasting effects on the immune system, the cumulative effects of sequential monotherapies can resemble the effects of a concurrent\ncombination therapy. This treatment scheme might lead to higher efficacy but also to new safety concerns. These sequential treatments were largely excluded in phase 2 and 3 trials; therefore, monitoring\nboth short-term and long-term effects of sequential disease-modifying therapies in phase 4 studies, cohort studies, and registries will be necessary.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32059809", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32059805", "Title": "Correction to Lancet Glob Health 2020; 8: e76-91.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

Self-report data suggest that physical activity and sedentary behaviour might be associated with depressive symptoms in adolescents.\nWe examined associations between depressive symptoms and objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour in adolescents. METHODS: From a population-based cohort of adolescents whose mothers were invited to participate in\nthe Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) study, we included participants with at least one accelerometer recording and a Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) depression score at age 17.8\nyears (reported as age 18 years hereafter). Amounts of time spent in sedentary behaviour and physical activity (light or moderate-to-vigorous) were measured with accelerometers at around 12 years, 14 years,\nand 16 years of age. Total physical activity was also recorded as count per minute (CPM), with raw accelerometer counts averaged over 60 s epochs. Associations between the physical activity\nand sedentary behaviour variables and depression (CIS-R) scores at age 18 years were analysed with regression and group-based trajectory modelling. FINDINGS: 4257 adolescents from the 14 901 enrolled in the\nALSPAC study had a CIS-R depression score at age 18 years. Longitudinal analyses included 2486 participants at age 12 years, 1938 at age 14 years, and 1220 at age 16\nyears. Total follow-up time was 6 years. Total physical activity decreased between 12 years and 16 years of age, driven by decreasing durations of light activity (mean 325.66 min/day [SD\n58.09] at 12 years; 244.94 min/day [55.08] at 16 years) and increasing sedentary behaviour (430.99 min/day [65.80]; 523.02 min/day [65.25]). Higher depression scores at 18 years were associated with a\n60 min/day increase in sedentary behaviour at 12 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.111 [95% CI 1.051-1.176]), 14 years (1.080 [1.012-1.152]), and 16 years of age (1.107 [1.015-1.208]). Depression scores\nat 18 years were lower for every additional 60 min/day of light activity at 12 years (0.904 [0.850-0.961]), 14 years (0.922 [0.857-0.992]), and 16 years of age (0.889 [0.809-0.974]). Group-based\ntrajectory modelling across 12-16 years of age identified three latent subgroups of sedentary behaviour and activity levels. Depression scores were higher in those with persistently high (IRR 1.282 [95% CI\n1.061-1.548]) and persistently average (1.249 [1.078-1.446]) sedentary behaviour compared with those with persistently low sedentary behaviour, and were lower in those with persistently high levels of light activity (0.804 [0.652-0.990])\ncompared with those with persistently low levels of light activity. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (per 15 min/day increase) at age 12 years (0.910 [0.857-0.966]) and total physical activity (per 100 CPM\nincrease) at ages 12 years (0.941 [0.910-0.972]) and 14 years (0.965 [0.932-0.999]), were negatively associated with depressive symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Sedentary behaviour displaces light activity throughout adolescence, and is associated with\na greater risk of depressive symptoms at 18 years of age.

Public health", "Creation Date": "2020/02/15 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 10", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Funding for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Japan began in 2010 for girls aged 12-16 years, with three-dose coverage initially reaching more than 70%. On June 14, 2013, 2\nmonths after formal inclusion in Japan's national immunisation programme, proactive recommendations for the HPV vaccine were suspended following reports of adverse events since found to be unrelated to vaccination, but\nwhich were extensively covered in the media. Vaccine coverage subsequently dropped to less than 1% and has remained this low to date. We aimed to quantify the impact of this\nvaccine hesitancy crisis, and the potential health gains if coverage can be restored. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used the Policy1-Cervix modelling platform. We adapted the model for Japan\nwith use of data on HPV prevalence, screening practices and coverage, and cervical cancer incidence and mortality. We evaluated the expected number of cervical cancer cases and deaths over the\nlifetime of cohorts born from 1994 to 2007 in the context of the vaccine hesitancy crisis. We assessed a range of recovery scenarios from 2020 onwards, including a scenario in\nwhich routine coverage is restored to 70%, with 50% catch-up coverage for the missed cohorts (aged 13-20 years in 2020). To estimate the impact of the vaccine crisis to date,\nwe also modelled a counterfactual scenario in which 70% coverage had been maintained in 12-year-olds from 2013 onwards. FINDINGS: The vaccine crisis from 2013 to 2019 is predicted to result\nin an additional 24 600-27 300 cases and 5000-5700 deaths over the lifetime of cohorts born between 1994 and 2007, compared with if coverage had remained at around 70% since\n2013. However, restoration of coverage in 2020, including catch-up vaccination for missed cohorts, could prevent 14 800-16 200 of these cases and 3000-3400 of these deaths. If coverage is not\nrestored in 2020, an additional 3400-3800 cases and 700-800 deaths will occur over the lifetime of individuals who are 12 years old in 2020 alone. If the crisis continues, 9300-10\n800 preventable deaths due to cervical cancer will occur in the next 50 years (2020-69). INTERPRETATION: The HPV vaccine crisis to date is estimated to result in around 5000 deaths\nfrom cervical cancer in Japan. Many of these deaths could still be prevented if vaccination coverage with extended catch-up can be rapidly restored.

METHODS: In this modelling study, we used two independently-developed cervical cancer microsimulation models-Harvard and Policy1-Cervix-to estimate changes in the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cervical cancer over\ntime in the USA, including herd effects from vaccination. We compared nine alternative scenarios for prophylactic HPV vaccination and cervical screening scale-up with a status quo scenario that involved no\nadditional interventions in the context of a threshold for cervical cancer elimination of four or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years. We also estimated the number of cervical cancer cases\nthat could be averted between 2019 and 2100 associated with the adoption of ambitious goals for cervical cancer screening and vaccination coverage, and other potential strategies. FINDINGS: Under status quo\nassumptions, the Havard and Policy1-Cervix models projected that cervical cancer incidence would decrease to less than four or fewer new cases per 100 000 women-years by the 2038 and 2046,\nrespectively. Scaling up screening coverage to 90% in 2020, was the most effective intervention to expedite time to elimination (10-13-year reduction), averting a mean of 1400-2088 additional cases annually between\n2019 and 2100. Increasing HPV vaccination coverage to 90% or vaccinating adults aged 26-45 years had relatively little effect on cervical cancer incidence. Sensitivity analysis using different population structures resulted\nin differences in time to elimination (range -10 years to +27 years) compared with status quo predictions. INTERPRETATION: The USA is on track to eliminate cervical cancer as a public\nhealth problem in the next two to three decades. Time to elimination could be expedited by 10-13 years by achieving higher screening coverage. Targeting of underscreened and under-vaccinated women remains\nkey to achieving cervical cancer elimination for all women.

In this study, we\naimed to determine the frequency and distribution of paediatric demyelinating and encephalitic syndromes with MOG antibodies, their response to treatment, and the phenotypes associated with poor prognosis. METHODS: In this\nprospective observational study, children with demyelinating syndromes and with encephalitis other than acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) recruited from 40 secondary and tertiary centres in Spain were investigated for MOG antibodies.\nAll MOG antibody-positive cases were included in our study, which assessed syndromes, treatment and response to treatment (ie, number of relapses), outcomes (measured with the modified Rankin scale [mRS]), and\nphenotypes associated with poor prognosis. We used Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests to analyse clinical features, and survival Cox regression to analyse time to antibody negativity. FINDINGS: Between\nJune 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2018, 239 children with demyelinating syndromes (cohort A) and 296 with encephalitis other than ADEM (cohort B) were recruited. 116 patients had MOG antibodies,\nincluding 94 (39%) from cohort A and 22 (7%) from cohort B; 57 (49%) were female, with a median age of 6.2 years (IQR 3.7-10.0). Presenting syndromes in these 116\npatients included ADEM (46 [68%]), encephalitis other than ADEM (22 [19%]), optic neuritis (20 [17%]), myelitis (13 [11%]), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (six [5%]), and other disorders (nine [8%]). Among\nthe patients with autoimmune encephalitis in cohort B (n=64), MOG antibodies were more common than all neuronal antibodies combined (22 [34%] vs 21 [33%]). After a median follow-up of 42\nmonths (IQR 22-67), 33 (28%) of the 116 patients had relapses, including 17 (17%) of 100 diagnosed at first episode. Steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange were used in 100\n(86%) patients at diagnosis, and 32 (97%) of 33 at relapses. Rituximab was mainly used at relapses (11 [33%]). 99 (85%) of 116 patients had substantial recovery (mRS <2) and\n17 (15%) moderate to severe deficits (mRS >2; one died). Phenotypes of poor prognosis included ADEM-like relapses progressing to leukodystrophy-like features, and extensive cortical encephalitis evolving to atrophy. Time to\nantibody negativity was longer in patients with relapses (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.59). INTERPRETATION: The spectrum of paediatric MOG antibody-associated syndromes is wider than previously reported and includes demyelinating syndromes\nand encephalitis. Recognition of these disorders has important clinical and prognostic implications.

At different stages in the disease, hepatitis flares might occur, which can be challenging to predict and manage.\nFlares are believed to be primarily immune-mediated and might mark transitions to inactive disease or clearance of infection, but in certain scenarios they might also lead to hepatic decompensation or\ndeath. As such, understanding of the clinical significance of flares in different patient populations and different scenarios is important for optimal management. In this Review, we summarise what is known\nabout flares in different stages of chronic HBV infection; describe flares in the context of the natural history of chronic infection; summarise the immunological mechanisms underlying flares, and describe flares\nin different clinical scenarios. Each section reviews existing knowledge and highlights key unanswered questions that need to be addressed to improve the understanding of flares, hopefully providing insights into their\npathogenesis that can be used to improve current clinical management and ideally to further develop new curative therapeutic approaches for HBV infection.

Air quality can also be affected by distant emission sources, however,\nincluding emissions from neighbouring federal states(5,6). This cross-state exchange of pollution poses additional regulatory challenges. Here we quantify the exchange of air pollution among the contiguous United States, and assess\nits impact on premature mortality that is linked to increased human exposure to PM2.5 and ozone from seven emission sectors for 2005 to 2018. On average, we find that 41\nto 53 per cent of air-quality-related premature mortality resulting from a state's emissions occurs outside that state. We also find variations in the cross-state contributions of different emission sectors and\nchemical species to premature mortality, and changes in these variations over time. Emissions from electric power generation have the greatest cross-state impacts as a fraction of their total impacts, whereas\ncommercial/residential emissions have the smallest. However, reductions in emissions from electric power generation since 2005 have meant that, by 2018, cross-state premature mortality associated with the commercial/residential sector was twice\nthat associated with power generation. In terms of the chemical species emitted, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions caused the most cross-state premature deaths in 2005, but by 2018 primary\nPM2.5 emissions led to cross-state premature deaths equal to three times those associated with sulfur dioxide emissions.

Unlike topological lasers that rely on large-scale features to impart topological protection, our compact design makes use of the valley degree of freedom in photonic\ncrystals(10,11), analogous to two-dimensional gapped valleytronic materials(12). Lasing with regularly spaced emission peaks occurs in a sharp-cornered triangular cavity, even if perturbations are introduced into the underlying structure, owing to\nthe existence of topologically protected valley edge states that circulate around the cavity without experiencing localization.

Here we report that a homologue\nof the claustrum, identified by single-cell transcriptomics and viral tracing of connectivity, also exists in a reptile-the Australian bearded dragon Pogona vitticeps. In Pogona, the claustrum underlies the generation of\nsharp waves during slow-wave sleep. The sharp waves, together with superimposed high-frequency ripples(2), propagate to the entire neighbouring pallial dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR). Unilateral or bilateral lesions of the claustrum\nsuppress the production of sharp-wave ripples during slow-wave sleep in a unilateral or bilateral manner, respectively, but do not affect the regular and rapidly alternating sleep rhythm that is characteristic\nof sleep in this species(3). The claustrum is thus not involved in the generation of the sleep rhythm itself. Tract tracing revealed that the reptilian claustrum projects widely to a\nvariety of forebrain areas, including the cortex, and that it receives converging inputs from, among others, areas of the mid- and hindbrain that are known to be involved in wake-sleep\ncontrol in mammals(4-6). Periodically modulating the concentration of serotonin in the claustrum, for example, caused a matching modulation of sharp-wave production there and in the neighbouring DVR. Using transcriptomic approaches,\nwe also identified a claustrum in the turtle Trachemys scripta, a distant reptilian relative of lizards. The claustrum is therefore an ancient structure that was probably already present in the\nbrain of the common vertebrate ancestor of reptiles and mammals.

Overexpression of IL-15 in both the epithelium and the lamina propria is required for the development\nof villous atrophy, which demonstrates the location-dependent central role of IL-15 in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. In addition, CD4(+) T cells and HLA-DQ8 have a crucial role in the\nlicensing of cytotoxic T cells to mediate intestinal epithelial cell lysis. We also demonstrate a role for the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in tissue destruction.\nBy reflecting the complex interaction between gluten, genetics and IL-15-driven tissue inflammation, this mouse model provides the opportunity to both increase our understanding of coeliac disease, and develop new therapeutic\nstrategies.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32051586", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32051585", "Title": "Mechanical regulation of glycolysis via cytoskeleton architecture.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/14 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "The mechanics of the cellular microenvironment continuously modulates cell functions such as growth, survival, apoptosis, differentiation and morphogenesis via cytoskeletal remodelling and actomyosin contractility(1-3). Although all of these processes consume\nenergy(4,5), it is unknown whether and how cells adapt their metabolic activity to variable mechanical cues. Here we report that the transfer of human bronchial epithelial cells from stiff to\nsoft substrates causes a downregulation of glycolysis via proteasomal degradation of the rate-limiting metabolic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK). PFK degradation is triggered by the disassembly of stress fibres, which releases the\nPFK-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing protein 21 (TRIM21). Transformed non-small-cell lung cancer cells, which maintain high glycolytic rates regardless of changing environmental mechanics, retain PFK expression by downregulating\nTRIM21, and by sequestering residual TRIM21 on a stress-fibre subset that is insensitive to substrate stiffness. Our data reveal a mechanism by which glycolysis responds to architectural features of the\nactomyosin cytoskeleton, thus coupling cell metabolism to the mechanical properties of the surrounding tissue. These processes enable normal cells to tune energy production in variable microenvironments, whereas the resistance of\nthe cytoskeleton in response to mechanical cues enables the persistence of high glycolytic rates in cancer cells despite constant alterations of the tumour tissue.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32051585", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32051584", "Title": "TLR9 and beclin 1 crosstalk regulates muscle AMPK activation in exercise.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/14 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "The activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle coordinates systemic metabolic responses to exercise(1). Autophagy-a lysosomal degradation pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis(2)-is upregulated during exercise, and a\ncore autophagy protein, beclin 1, is required for AMPK activation in skeletal muscle(3).

Mice that lack TLR9 are deficient in both exercise-induced activation of AMPK and plasma membrane localization of the GLUT4\nglucose transporter in skeletal muscle, but are not deficient in autophagy. TLR9 binds beclin 1, and this interaction is increased by energy stress (glucose starvation and endurance exercise) and decreased\nby a BCL2 mutation(3,5) that blocks the disruption of BCL2-beclin 1 binding. TLR9 regulates the assembly of the endolysosomal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (PI3KC3-C2)-which contains beclin 1 and UVRAG-in skeletal muscle\nduring exercise, and knockout of beclin 1 or UVRAG inhibits the cellular AMPK activation induced by glucose starvation.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study alongside individual participant meta-analysis of other cohort studies. SETTING: United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Analytical sample of 499 701 people (response rate\n5.5%) in analyses in UK Biobank; pooled data from the Health Surveys for England (HSE) and the Scottish Health Surveys (SHS), including 18 studies and 89 895 people (mean response\nrate 68%). Both study populations were linked to the same nationwide mortality registries, and the baseline age range was aligned at 40-69 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death from cardiovascular disease,\nselected malignancies, and suicide. To quantify the difference between hazard ratios in the two studies, a ratio of the hazard ratios was used with HSE-SHS as the referent. RESULTS: Risk\nfactor levels and mortality rates were typically more favourable in UK Biobank participants relative to the HSE-SHS consortium. For the associations between risk factors and mortality endpoints, however, close agreement\nwas seen between studies. Based on 14 288 deaths during an average of 7.0 years of follow-up in UK Biobank and 7861 deaths over 10 years of mortality surveillance in\nHSE-SHS, for cardiovascular disease mortality, for instance, the age and sex adjusted hazard ratio for ever having smoked cigarettes (versus never) was 2.04 (95% confidence interval 1.87 to 2.24) in\nUK Biobank and 1.99 (1.78 to 2.23) in HSE-SHS, yielding a ratio of hazard ratios close to unity (1.02, 0.88 to 1.19). The overall pattern of agreement between studies was\nessentially unchanged when results were compared separately by sex and when baseline years and censoring dates were aligned.

By histology,\nastrocytic plaques are diagnostic of CBD(7,8); by SDS-PAGE, so too are detergent-insoluble, 37 kDa fragments of tau(9).

How the intestine coordinates physiological and immune responses to food consumption to optimize nutrient uptake while maintaining barrier functions remains unclear. Here\nwe show in mice how a gut neuronal signal triggered by food intake is integrated with intestinal antimicrobial and metabolic responses that are controlled by type-3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3)(1-3).\nFood consumption rapidly activates a population of enteric neurons that express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)(4). Projections of VIP-producing neurons (VIPergic neurons) in the lamina propria are in close proximity to\nclusters of ILC3 that selectively express VIP receptor type 2 (VIPR2; also known as VPAC2). Production of interleukin (IL)-22 by ILC3, which is upregulated by the presence of commensal microorganisms\nsuch as segmented filamentous bacteria(5-7), is inhibited upon engagement of VIPR2. As a consequence, levels of antimicrobial peptide derived from epithelial cells are reduced but the expression of lipid-binding proteins\nand transporters is increased(8). During food consumption, the activation of VIPergic neurons thus enhances the growth of segmented filamentous bacteria associated with the epithelium, and increases lipid absorption. Our results\nreveal a feeding- and circadian-regulated dynamic neuroimmune circuit in the intestine that promotes a trade-off between innate immune protection mediated by IL-22 and the efficiency of nutrient absorption.

METHODS: HIP ATTACK was an international, randomised, controlled trial done at 69 hospitals in 17 countries. Patients with a hip fracture that required surgery and were aged\n45 years or older were eligible. Research personnel randomly assigned patients (1:1) through a central computerised randomisation system using randomly varying block sizes to either accelerated surgery (goal of surgery\nwithin 6 h of diagnosis) or standard care. The coprimary outcomes were mortality and a composite of major complications (ie, mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, sepsis, pneumonia,\nlife-threatening bleeding, and major bleeding) at 90 days after randomisation. Patients, health-care providers, and study staff were aware of treatment assignment, but outcome adjudicators were masked to treatment allocation.

Balancing risks and benefits of vasopressors is a challenge, particularly in older patients. Objective: To\ndetermine whether reducing exposure to vasopressors through permissive hypotension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] target, 60-65 mm Hg) reduces mortality at 90 days in ICU patients aged 65 years or older\nwith vasodilatory hypotension. Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicenter, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 65 ICUs in the United Kingdom and included 2600 randomized patients aged 65 years\nor older with vasodilatory hypotension (assessed by treating clinician). The study was conducted from July 2017 to March 2019, and follow-up was completed in August 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomized\n1:1 to vasopressors guided either by MAP target (60-65 mm Hg, permissive hypotension) (n = 1291) or according to usual care (at the discretion of treating clinicians) (n = 1307).\nMain Outcome and Measures: The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Results: Of 2600 randomized patients, after removal of those who declined or had withdrawn consent, 2463\n(95%) were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (mean [SD] age 75 years [7 years]; 1387 [57%] men). Patients randomized to the permissive hypotension group had lower exposure\nto vasopressors compared with those in the usual care group (median duration 33 hours vs 38 hours; difference in medians, -5.0; 95% CI, -7.8 to -2.2 hours; total dose in\nnorepinephrine equivalents median, 17.7 mg vs 26.4 mg; difference in medians, -8.7 mg; 95% CI, -12.8 to -4.6 mg). At 90 days, 500 of 1221 (41.0%) in the permissive hypotension\ncompared with 544 of 1242 (43.8%) in the usual care group had died (absolute risk difference, -2.85%; 95% CI, -6.75 to 1.05; P = .15) (unadjusted relative risk, 0.93; 95%\nCI, 0.85-1.03). When adjusted for prespecified baseline variables, the odds ratio for 90-day mortality was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.98). Serious adverse events were reported for 79 patients (6.2%)\nin the permissive care group and 75 patients (5.8%) in the usual care group. The most common serious adverse events were acute renal failure (41 [3.2%] vs 33 [2.5%]) and\nsupraventricular cardiac arrhythmia (12 [0.9%] vs 13 [1.0%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients 65 years or older receiving vasopressors for vasodilatory hypotension, permissive hypotension compared with usual care did not\nresult in a statistically significant reduction in mortality at 90 days. However, the confidence interval around the point estimate for the primary outcome should be considered when interpreting the clinical\nimportance of the study.

More than 6 million\nindividuals worldwide have Parkinson disease. Observations: Diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on history and examination. History can include prodromal features (eg, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, constipation),\ncharacteristic movement difficulty (eg, tremor, stiffness, slowness), and psychological or cognitive problems (eg, cognitive decline, depression, anxiety). Examination typically demonstrates bradykinesia with tremor, rigidity, or both. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission\ncomputed tomography can improve the accuracy of diagnosis when the presence of parkinsonism is uncertain. Parkinson disease has multiple disease variants with different prognoses. Individuals with a diffuse malignant subtype\n(9%-16% of individuals with Parkinson disease) have prominent early motor and nonmotor symptoms, poor response to medication, and faster disease progression. Individuals with mild motor-predominant Parkinson disease (49%-53% of individuals\nwith Parkinson disease) have mild symptoms, a good response to dopaminergic medications (eg, carbidopa-levodopa, dopamine agonists), and slower disease progression. Other individuals have an intermediate subtype. For all patients with\nParkinson disease, treatment is symptomatic, focused on improvement in motor (eg, tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and nonmotor (eg, constipation, cognition, mood, sleep) signs and symptoms. No disease-modifying pharmacologic treatments are available.\nDopamine-based therapies typically help initial motor symptoms. Nonmotor symptoms require nondopaminergic approaches (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for psychiatric symptoms, cholinesterase inhibitors for cognition). Rehabilitative therapy and exercise complement pharmacologic\ntreatments. Individuals experiencing complications, such as worsening symptoms and functional impairment when a medication dose wears off (\"off periods\"), medication-resistant tremor, and dyskinesias, benefit from advanced treatments such as therapy\nwith levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension or deep brain stimulation. Palliative care is part of Parkinson disease management. Conclusions and Relevance: Parkinson disease is a heterogeneous disease with rapidly and slowly progressive\nforms. Treatment involves pharmacologic approaches (typically with levodopa preparations prescribed with or without other medications) and nonpharmacologic approaches (such as exercise and physical, occupational, and speech therapies). Approaches such as\ndeep brain stimulation and treatment with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension can help individuals with medication-resistant tremor, worsening symptoms when the medication wears off, and dyskinesias.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32044947", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32044946", "Title": "Such Promise.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/05 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 11", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32044946", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32044944", "Title": "Medical Cannabis.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/05 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 11", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32044944", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32044943", "Title": "Effect of Vancomycin or Daptomycin With vs Without an Antistaphylococcal beta-Lactam on Mortality, Bacteremia, Relapse, or Treatment Failure in Patients With MRSA Bacteremia: A Randomized Clinical Trial.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/03/05 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 11", "Abstract": "Importance: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is associated with mortality of more than 20%. Combining standard therapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic has been associated with reduced mortality, although adequately powered\nrandomized clinical trials of this intervention have not been conducted. Objective: To determine whether combining an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam with standard therapy is more effective than standard therapy alone in patients\nwith MRSA bacteremia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 27 hospital sites in 4 countries from August 2015 to July 2018 among 352 hospitalized adults with\nMRSA bacteremia. Follow-up was complete on October 23, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomized to standard therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin) plus an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam (intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin) (n\n= 174) or standard therapy alone (n = 178). Total duration of therapy was determined by treating clinicians and the beta-lactam was administered for 7 days. Main Outcomes and Measures:\nThe primary end point was a 90-day composite of mortality, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, and microbiological treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included mortality at days 14, 42, and\n90; persistent bacteremia at days 2 and 5; acute kidney injury (AKI); microbiological relapse; microbiological treatment failure; and duration of intravenous antibiotics. Results: The data and safety monitoring board recommended\nearly termination of the study prior to enrollment of 440 patients because of safety. Among 352 patients randomized (mean age, 62.2 [SD, 17.7] years; 121 women [34.4%]), 345 (98%) completed\nthe trial. The primary end point was met by 59 (35%) with combination therapy and 68 (39%) with standard therapy (absolute difference, -4.2%; 95% CI, -14.3% to 6.0%). Seven of\n9 prespecified secondary end points showed no significant difference. For the combination therapy vs standard therapy groups, all-cause 90-day mortality occurred in 35 (21%) vs 28 (16%) (difference, 4.5%; 95%\nCI, -3.7% to 12.7%); persistent bacteremia at day 5 was observed in 19 of 166 (11%) vs 35 of 172 (20%) (difference, -8.9%; 95% CI, -16.6% to -1.2%); and, excluding\npatients receiving dialysis at baseline, AKI occurred in 34 of 145 (23%) vs 9 of 145 (6%) (difference, 17.2%; 95% CI, 9.3%-25.2%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with MRSA bacteremia,\naddition of an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam to standard antibiotic therapy with vancomycin or daptomycin did not result in significant improvement in the primary composite end point of mortality, persistent bacteremia, relapse,\nor treatment failure. Early trial termination for safety concerns and the possibility that the study was underpowered to detect clinically important differences in favor of the intervention should be considered\nwhen interpreting the findings.

It is not known if negative pressure wound therapy can reduce infection rates in this setting.\nObjective: To assess outcomes in patients who have incisions resulting from surgery for lower limb fractures related to major trauma and were treated with either incisional negative pressure wound therapy\nor standard wound dressing. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial conducted at 24 trauma hospitals representing the UK Major Trauma Network that included 1548 patients aged 16 years\nor older who underwent surgery for a lower limb fracture caused by major trauma from July 7, 2016, through April 17, 2018, with follow-up to December 11, 2018. Interventions: Incisional\nnegative pressure wound therapy (n = 785), which involved a specialized dressing used to create negative pressure over the wound, vs standard wound dressing not involving negative pressure (n =\n763). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was deep surgical site infection at 30 days diagnosed according to the criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention. A preplanned secondary analysis of the primary outcome was performed at 90 days. The secondary outcomes were patient-reported disability (Disability Rating Index), health-related quality of life (EuroQol 5-level EQ-5D),\nsurgical scar assessment (Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale), and chronic pain (Douleur Neuropathique Questionnaire) at 3 and 6 months, as well as other local wound healing complications at 30\ndays. Results: Among 1548 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [20.3] years; 561 [36%] were aged </=40 years; 583 [38%] women; and 881 [57%] had multiple injuries), 1519\n(98%) had data available for the primary outcome. At 30 days, deep surgical site infection occurred in 5.84% (45 of 770 patients) of the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group\nand in 6.68% (50 of 749 patients) of the standard wound dressing group (odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.57 to 1.33]; absolute risk difference, -0.77% [95% CI, -3.19% to 1.66%];\nP = .52). There was no significant difference in the deep surgical site infection rate at 90 days (11.4% [72 of 629 patients] in the incisional negative pressure wound therapy\ngroup vs 13.2% [78 of 590 patients] in the standard wound dressing group; odds ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.19]; absolute risk difference, -1.76% [95% CI, -5.41% to 1.90%];\nP = .32). For the 5 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, there were no significant differences at any time point. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients who underwent surgery for major trauma-related\nlower limb fractures, use of incisional negative pressure wound therapy, compared with standard wound dressing, resulted in no significant difference in the rate of deep surgical site infection. The findings\ndo not support the use of incisional negative pressure wound therapy in this setting, although the event rate at 30 days was lower than expected.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of claims data from a large US commercial insurer, representing 347356 patients who had undergone 1 of 7 common elective operations (arthroscopic meniscal\nrepair [116749]; laparoscopic cholecystectomy [82372]; hysterectomy [67452]; total knee replacement [42313]; breast lumpectomy [18018]; colectomy [14074]; coronary artery bypass graft surgery [6378]) by an in-network primary surgeon at an in-network\nfacility between January 1, 2012, and September 30, 2017. Follow-up ended November 8, 2017. Exposure: Patient, clinician, and insurance factors potentially related to out-of-network bills. Main Outcomes and Measures: The\nprimary outcome was the proportion of episodes with out-of-network bills. The secondary outcome was the estimated potential balance bill associated with out-of-network bills from each surgical procedure, calculated as total\nout-of-network charges less the typical in-network price for the same service. Results: Among 347356 patients (mean age, 48 [SD, 11] years; 66% women) who underwent surgery with in-network primary surgeons\nand facilities, 20.5% of episodes (95% CI, 19.4%-21.7%) had an out-of-network bill. In these episodes, the mean potential balance bill per episode was $2011 (95% CI, $1866-$2157) when present. Out-of-network\nbills were associated with surgical assistants in 37% of these episodes; when present, the mean potential balance bill was $3633 (95% CI, $3384-$3883). Out-of-network bills were associated with anesthesiologists in\n37% of episodes; when present, the mean potential balance bill was $1219 (95% CI, $1049-$1388). Membership in health insurance exchange plans, compared with nonexchange plans, was associated with a significantly\nhigher risk of out-of-network bills (27% vs 20%, respectively; risk difference, 6% [95% CI, 3.9%-8.9%]; P < .001). Surgical complications were associated with a significantly higher risk of out-of-network bills,\ncompared with episodes with no complications (28% vs 20%, respectively; risk difference, 7% [95% CI, 5.8%-8.8%]; P < .001). Among 83021 procedures performed at ambulatory surgery centers with in-network primary\nsurgeons, 6.7% (95% CI, 5.8%-7.7%) included an out-of-network facility bill and 17.2% (95% CI, 15.7%-18.8%) included an out-of-network professional bill. Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective analysis of commercially insured\npatients who had undergone elective surgery at in-network facilities with in-network primary surgeons, a substantial proportion of operations were associated with out-of-network bills.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32044941", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR

The efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS remains controversial. We aimed to assess the\neffects of dexamethasone in ARDS, which might change pulmonary and systemic inflammation and result in a decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality. METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised\ncontrolled trial in a network of 17 intensive care units (ICUs) in teaching hospitals across Spain in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of partial pressure of\narterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 200 mm Hg or less assessed with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm H2O or more and FiO2 of 0.5\nor more at 24 h after ARDS onset). Patients with brain death, terminal-stage disease, or receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs were excluded. Eligible patients were randomly assigned based on balanced\ntreatment assignments with a computerised randomisation allocation sequence using blocks of 10 opaque, sealed envelopes to receive immediate treatment with dexamethasone or continued routine intensive care (control group). Patients in\nthe dexamethasone group received an intravenous dose of 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, which was reduced to 10 mg once daily from day 6 to\nday 10. Patients in both groups were ventilated with lung-protective mechanical ventilation. Allocation concealment was maintained at all sites during the trial. Primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days\nat 28 days, defined as the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation from day of randomisation to day 28. Secondary outcome was all-cause mortality 60 days after\nrandomisation. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01731795. FINDINGS: Between March 28, 2013, and Dec 31, 2018, we enrolled 277 patients\nand randomly assigned 139 patients to the dexamethasone group and 138 to the control group. The trial was stopped by the data safety monitoring board due to low enrolment rate\nafter enrolling more than 88% (277/314) of the planned sample size. The mean number of ventilator-free days was higher in the dexamethasone group than in the control group (between-group difference\n4.8 days [95% CI 2.57 to 7.03]; p<0.0001). At 60 days, 29 (21%) patients in the dexamethasone group and 50 (36%) patients in the control group had died (between-group difference\n-15.3% [-25.9 to -4.9]; p=0.0047). The proportion of adverse events did not differ significantly between the dexamethasone group and control group. The most common adverse events were hyperglycaemia in the\nICU (105 [76%] patients in the dexamethasone group vs 97 [70%] patients in the control group), new infections in the ICU (eg, pneumonia or sepsis; 33 [24%] vs 35 [25%]),\nand barotrauma (14 [10%] vs 10 [7%]). INTERPRETATION: Early administration of dexamethasone could reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and overall mortality in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS.

Encouraging oncological results were noted at 3 years'\nfollow-up but needed to be corroborated with longer follow-up. In this study, we aimed to report the 5-year oncological outcomes, including local recurrence, metastatic disease, and survival. METHODS: Patients age\n18 years and older with T2T3 low rectal cancer, of maximum size 4 cm, who were clinically good responders after chemoradiotherapy (residual tumour </=2 cm) were randomly assigned before surgery\nto either local excision or total mesorectal excision. Randomisation was centralised and not stratified and used permuted blocks of size eight. In the local excision group, a completion total mesorectal\nexcision was performed if pathological tumour stage was ypT2-3. The primary objective of this study was to assess the 5-year oncological outcomes of local recurrence, metastatic disease, disease-free survival, overall\nsurvival, and cancer-specific mortality, which were the secondary endpoints of GRECCAR 2. We used Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox modelling to estimate and compare recurrence and survival in modified intention-to-treat and\nas-treated populations. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00427375. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2007, and Sept 24, 2012, 148 patients who were good clinical responders were randomly assigned to\ntreatment, three patients were excluded after randomisation (because they had metastatic disease, tumour >8 cm from anal verge, or withdrew consent), leaving 145 for analysis: 74 in the local excision\ngroup and 71 in the total mesorectal excision group. Median follow-up was 60 months (IQR 58-60) in the local excision group and 60 months (57-60) in the total mesorectal excision\ngroup. 23 patients died and five were lost to follow-up. In the local excision group, 26 had a completion total mesorectal excision for ypT2-3 tumour. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis,\nthere was no difference between the local excision and total mesorectal excision groups in 5-year local recurrence (7% [95% CI 3-16] vs 7% [3-16]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.71 [95%\nCI 0.19-2.58]; p=0.60), metastatic disease (18% [CI 11-30] vs 19% [11-31]; 0.86 [0.36-2.06]; p=0.73), overall survival (84% [73-91] vs 82% [71-90]; 0.92 [0.38-2.22]; p=0.85), disease-free survival (70% [58-79] vs 72%\n[60-82]; 0.87 [0.44-1.72]; p=0.68), or cancer-specific mortality (7% [3-17] vs 10% [5-20]; 0.65 [0.17-2.49]; p=0.53). INTERPRETATION: The 5-year results of this multicentre randomised trial corroborate the 3-year results, providing no\nevidence of difference in oncological outcomes between local excision and total mesorectal excision. Local excision can be proposed in selected patients having a small T2T3 low rectal cancer with a\ngood clinical response after chemoradiotherapy.

The reproducible generation and characterization of attosecond waveforms has been demonstrated so far only\nthrough the process of high-order harmonic generation(4-7). Several methods for shaping attosecond waveforms have been proposed, including the use of metallic filters(8,9), multilayer mirrors(10) and manipulation of the driving field(11).\nHowever, none of these approaches allows the flexible manipulation of the temporal characteristics of the attosecond waveforms, and they suffer from the low conversion efficiency of the high-order harmonic generation\nprocess. Free-electron lasers, by contrast, deliver femtosecond, extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray pulses with energies ranging from tens of microjoules to a few millijoules(12,13). Recent experiments have shown that they can generate\nsubfemtosecond spikes, but with temporal characteristics that change shot-to-shot(14-16).

DESIGN: Two stage time series analysis. SETTING: 406 cities in 20\ncountries, with overlapping periods between 1985 and 2015, collected from the database of Multi-City Multi-Country Collaborative Research Network. POPULATION: Deaths for all causes or for external causes only registered in\neach city within the study period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily total mortality (all or non-external causes only). RESULTS: A total of 45 165 171 deaths were analysed in the 406\ncities. On average, a 10 microg/m(3) increase in ozone during the current and previous day was associated with an overall relative risk of mortality of 1.0018 (95% confidence interval 1.0012\nto 1.0024). Some heterogeneity was found across countries, with estimates ranging from greater than 1.0020 in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Estonia, and Canada to less than 1.0008 in Mexico\nand Spain. Short term excess mortality in association with exposure to ozone higher than maximum background levels (70 microg/m(3)) was 0.26% (95% confidence interval 0.24% to 0.28%), corresponding to 8203\nannual excess deaths (95% confidence interval 3525 to 12 840) across the 406 cities studied. The excess remained at 0.20% (0.18% to 0.22%) when restricting to days above the WHO\nguideline (100 microg/m(3)), corresponding to 6262 annual excess deaths (1413 to 11 065). Above more lenient thresholds for air quality standards in Europe, America, and China, excess mortality was 0.14%,\n0.09%, and 0.05%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that ozone related mortality could be potentially reduced under stricter air quality standards.

DESIGN:\nSystematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CPCI, Zetoc, Science Citation Index, and online trial registers (from database inception to\n10 April 2019). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Studies of any design that evaluated algorithm based smartphone apps to assess images of skin lesions suspicious for skin cancer. Reference standards\nincluded histological diagnosis or follow-up, and expert recommendation for further investigation or intervention. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed validity using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2\ntool). Estimates of sensitivity and specificity were reported for each app. RESULTS: Nine studies that evaluated six different identifiable smartphone apps were included. Six verified results by using histology or\nfollow-up (n=725 lesions), and three verified results by using expert recommendations (n=407 lesions). Studies were small and of poor methodological quality, with selective recruitment, high rates of unevaluable images, and\ndifferential verification. Lesion selection and image acquisition were performed by clinicians rather than smartphone users. Two CE (Conformit Europenne) marked apps are available for download. SkinScan was evaluated in a\nsingle study (n=15, five melanomas) with 0% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the detection of melanoma. SkinVision was evaluated in two studies (n=252, 61 malignant or premalignant lesions) and achieved\na sensitivity of 80% (95% confidence interval 63% to 92%) and a specificity of 78% (67% to 87%) for the detection of malignant or premalignant lesions. Accuracy of the SkinVision\napp verified against expert recommendations was poor (three studies). CONCLUSIONS: Current algorithm based smartphone apps cannot be relied on to detect all cases of melanoma or other skin cancers. Test\nperformance is likely to be poorer than reported here when used in clinically relevant populations and by the intended users of the apps. The current regulatory process for awarding the\nCE marking for algorithm based apps does not provide adequate protection to the public.

Circadian release of melatonin at night from the pineal gland\nactivates melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, synchronizing the physiology and behaviour of animals to the light-dark cycle(1-4). The two receptors are established drug targets for aligning\ncircadian phase to this cycle in disorders of sleep(5,6) and depression(1-4,7-9). Despite their importance, few in vivo active MT1-selective ligands have been reported(2,8,10-12), hampering both the understanding of circadian biology\nand the development of targeted therapeutics. Here we docked more than 150 million virtual molecules to an MT1 crystal structure, prioritizing structural fit and chemical novelty. Of these compounds, 38\nhigh-ranking molecules were synthesized and tested, revealing ligands with potencies ranging from 470 picomolar to 6 micromolar. Structure-based optimization led to two selective MT1 inverse agonists-which were topologically unrelated to\npreviously explored chemotypes-that acted as inverse agonists in a mouse model of circadian re-entrainment. Notably, we found that these MT1-selective inverse agonists advanced the phase of the mouse circadian clock\nby 1.3-1.5 h when given at subjective dusk, an agonist-like effect that was eliminated in MT1- but not in MT2-knockout mice. This study illustrates the opportunities for modulating melatonin receptor\nbiology through MT1-selective ligands and for the discovery of previously undescribed, in vivo active chemotypes from structure-based screens of diverse, ultralarge libraries.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32040955", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32040185", "Title": "Microaxial Left Ventricular Assist Devices: In Search of an Appropriate Indication.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/11 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 10", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32040185", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32040163", "Title": "Association of Use of an Intravascular Microaxial Left Ventricular Assist Device vs Intra-aortic Balloon Pump With In-Hospital Mortality and Major Bleeding Among Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction Complicated by Cardiogenic Shock.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/11 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 10", "Abstract": "Importance: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although intravascular microaxial left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) provide greater hemodynamic support as compared\nwith intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABPs), little is known about clinical outcomes associated with intravascular microaxial LVAD use in clinical practice. Objective: To examine outcomes among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention\n(PCI) for AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock treated with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices. Design, Setting, and Participants: A propensity-matched registry-based retrospective cohort study of patients with AMI complicated by\ncardiogenic shock undergoing PCI between October 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017, who were included in data from hospitals participating in the CathPCI and the Chest Pain-MI registries, both part\nof the American College of Cardiology's National Cardiovascular Data Registry. Patients receiving an intravascular microaxial LVAD were matched with those receiving IABP on demographics, clinical history, presentation, infarct location, coronary\nanatomy, and clinical laboratory data, with final follow-up through December 31, 2017. Exposures: Hemodynamic support, categorized as intravascular microaxial LVAD use only, IABP only, other (such as use of a\npercutaneous extracorporeal ventricular assist system, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or a combination of MCS device use), or medical therapy only. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and\nin-hospital major bleeding. Results: Among 28304 patients undergoing PCI for AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock, the mean (SD) age was 65.0 (12.6) years, 67.0% were men, 81.3% had an ST-elevation\nmyocardial infarction, and 43.3% had cardiac arrest. Over the study period among patients with AMI, an intravascular microaxial LVAD was used in 6.2% of patients, and IABP was used in\n29.9%. Among 1680 propensity-matched pairs, there was a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death associated with use of an intravascular microaxial LVAD (45.0%) vs with an IABP (34.1% [absolute risk\ndifference, 10.9 percentage points {95% CI, 7.6-14.2}; P < .001) and also higher risk of in-hospital major bleeding (intravascular microaxial LVAD [31.3%] vs IABP [16.0%]; absolute risk difference, 15.4 percentage\npoints [95% CI, 12.5-18.2]; P < .001). These associations were consistent regardless of whether patients received a device before or after initiation of PCI. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients undergoing\nPCI for AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock from 2015 to 2017, use of an intravascular microaxial LVAD compared with IABP was associated with higher adjusted risk of in-hospital death and\nmajor bleeding complications, although study interpretation is limited by the observational design.

Functional bracing is an alternative\nnon-operative treatment that allows earlier mobilisation, but evidence on its effectiveness and safety is scarce. The aim of the UKSTAR trial was to compare functional and quality-of-life outcomes and resource\nuse in patients treated non-operatively with plaster cast versus functional brace. METHODS: UKSTAR was a pragmatic, superiority, multicentre, randomised controlled trial done at 39 hospitals in the UK. Patients (aged\n>/=16 years) who were being treated non-operatively for a primary Achilles tendon rupture at the participating centres were potentially eligible. The exclusion criteria were presenting more than 14 days after\ninjury, previous rupture of the same Achilles tendon, or being unable to complete the questionnaires. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a plaster cast or functional brace using\na centralised web-based system. Because the interventions were clearly visible, neither patients nor clinicians could be masked. Participants wore the intervention for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was patient-reported Achilles\ntendon rupture score (ATRS) at 9 months, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all patients in the groups to which they were allocated, excluding participants who withdrew or died before\nproviding any outcome data). The main safety outcome was the incidence of tendon re-rupture. Resource use was recorded from a health and personal social care perspective. The trial is registered\nwith ISRCTN, ISRCTN62639639. FINDINGS: Between Aug 15, 2016, and May 31, 2018, 1451 patients were screened, of whom 540 participants (mean age 48.7 years, 79% male) were randomly allocated to\nreceive plaster cast (n=266) or functional brace (n=274). 527 (98%) of 540 were included in the modified intention-to-treat population, and 13 (2%) were excluded because they withdrew or died before\nproviding any outcome data. There was no difference in ATRS at 9 months post injury (cast group n=244, mean ATRS 744 [SD 198]; functional brace group n=259, ATRS 728 [204];\nadjusted mean difference -138 [95% CI -49 to 21], p=0.44). There was no difference in the rate of re-rupture of the tendon (17 [6%] of 266 in the plaster cast\ngroup vs 13 [5%] of 274 in the functional brace group, p=0.40). The mean total health and personal social care cost was pound1181 for the plaster cast group and pound1078\nfor the functional bract group (mean between-group difference - pound103 [95% CI -289 to 84]). INTERPRETATION: Traditional plaster casting was not found to be superior to early weight-bearing in a\nfunctional brace, as measured by ATRS, in the management of patients treated non-surgically for Achilles tendon rupture. Clinicians may consider the use of early weight-bearing in a functional brace as\na safe and cost-effective alternative to plaster casting.

METHODS: BE ACTIVE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b study done at 41 sites in the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary,\nPoland, Russia, and the USA. Eligible patients aged 18 years or older with active adult-onset psoriatic arthritis and symptoms for at least 6 months were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to placebo,\n16 mg bimekizumab, 160 mg bimekizumab, 160 mg bimekizumab with a one-off 320 mg loading dose, or 320 mg bimekizumab, which were administered as subcutaneous injections every 4 weeks for\n12 weeks. After 12 weeks, patients assigned to the placebo and 16 mg bimekizumab groups were randomly reassigned (1:1) to either 160 mg or 320 mg bimekizumab, and all other\npatients remained on their originally assigned initial dose up to 48 weeks. Both participants and researchers were blinded to treatment allocation in the first 12 weeks, and blinded to the\ndose of bimekizumab thereafter. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least 50% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria at week 12, which was\nassessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had a valid measurement of the primary efficacy endpoint at baseline.

At 12 weeks, 24 (57%)\nof 42 patients in the placebo group and 68 (41%) of the 164 patients in the bimekizumab groups reported treatment-emergent adverse events. Most of these adverse events were mild or\nmoderate. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in nine patients, eight of whom were receiving bimekizumab. No deaths or cases of inflammatory bowel disease were reported.

METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial (ROCSS) done in 37 hospitals across\nthree European countries (35 UK, one Denmark, one Netherlands), patients aged 18 years or older undergoing elective ileostomy or colostomy closure were randomly assigned using a computer-based algorithm in a\n1:1 ratio to either biological mesh reinforcement or closure with sutures alone (control). Training in the novel technique was standardised across hospitals. Patients and outcome assessors were masked to treatment\nallocation. The primary outcome measure was occurrence of clinically detectable hernia 2 years after randomisation (intention to treat). A sample size of 790 patients was required to identify a 40%\nreduction (25% to 15%), with 90% power (15% drop-out rate). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02238964. FINDINGS: Between Nov 28, 2012, and Nov 11, 2015, of 1286 screened patients,\n790 were randomly assigned. 394 (50%) patients were randomly assigned to mesh closure and 396 (50%) to standard closure. In the mesh group, 373 (95%) of 394 patients successfully received\nmesh and in the control group, three patients received mesh. The clinically detectable hernia rate, the primary outcome, at 2 years was 12% (39 of 323) in the mesh group\nand 20% (64 of 327) in the control group (adjusted relative risk [RR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.90; p=0.012). In 455 patients for whom 1 year postoperative CT scans were available,\nthere was a lower radiologically defined hernia rate in mesh versus control groups (20 [9%] of 229 vs 47 [21%] of 226, adjusted RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.69; p<0.001). There\nwas also a reduction in symptomatic hernia (16%, 52 of 329 vs 19%, 64 of 331; adjusted relative risk 0.83, 0.60-1.16; p=0.29) and surgical reintervention (12%, 42 of 344 vs\n16%, 54 of 346: adjusted relative risk 0.78, 0.54-1.13; p=0.19) at 2 years, but this result did not reach statistical significance. No significant differences were seen in wound infection rate,\nseroma rate, quality of life, pain scores, or serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Reinforcement of the abdominal wall with a biological mesh at the time of stoma closure reduced clinically detectable\nincisional hernia within 24 months of surgery and with an acceptable safety profile. The results of this study support the use of biological mesh in stoma closure site reinforcement to\nreduce the early formation of incisional hernias.

HIV", "Creation Date": "2020/02/10 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 6", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The RV144 phase 3 vaccine trial in Thailand demonstrated that ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) and AIDSVAX B/E administration over 6 months resulted in a 31% efficacy in preventing HIV acquisition. In\nthis trial, we assessed the immunological effect of an additional vaccine boost to the RV144 regimen at varying intervals between the priming vaccine series and the boost. METHODS: RV306 is\na double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial done at three clinical sites in Thailand. Eligible volunteers were HIV-uninfected individuals aged 20-40 years who were at low risk for HIV infection and\nin good health. A randomisation schedule was centrally generated with fixed sized strata for Research Institute for Health Sciences Chiang Mai and combined Bangkok clinics. Participants were randomly assigned to\none of five groups and then further randomly assigned to either vaccine or placebo. All participants received the primary RV144 vaccine series at months 0, 1, 3, and 6. Group\n1 received no additional boost, group 2 received additional AIDSVAX B/E and ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) or placebo at month 12, group 3 received AIDSVAX B/E alone or placebo at month 12,\ngroup 4a received AIDSVAX B/E and ALVAC-HIV or placebo at month 15, and group 4b received AIDSVAX B/E and ALVAC-HIV or placebo at month 18. Primary outcomes were safety and\ntolerability of these vaccination regimens and cellular and humoral immune responses compared between the RV144 series alone and regimens with late boosts at different timepoints. Safety and tolerability outcomes were\nassessed by evaluating local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events in all participants. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01931358); clinical follow-up is now complete. FINDINGS: Between Oct 28, 2013,\nand April 29, 2014, 367 participants were enrolled, of whom 27 were assigned active vaccination in group 1, 102 in group 2, 101 in group 3, 52 in group 4a,\n51 in group 4b, and 34 combined placebo across all the groups. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. Occurrence and severity of local and systemic reactogenicity were similar across\nactive groups. Groups with late boosts (groups 2, 3, 4a, and 4b) had increased peak plasma IgG-binding antibody levels against gp70 V1V2 relative to group 1 vaccine recipients with no\nlate boost (gp70 V1V2 92TH023 adjusted p<0.02 for each; gp70 V1V2 CaseA2 adjusted p<0.0001 for each). Boosting at month 12 (groups 2 and 3) did not increase gp120 responses compared\nwith the peak responses after the RV144 priming regimen at month 6; however, boosting at month 15 (group 4a) improved responses to gp120 A244gD- D11 (p=0.0003), and boosting at month\n18 (group 4b) improved responses to both gp120 A244gD- D11 (p<0.0001) and gp120 MNgD- D11 (p=0.0016). Plasma IgG responses were significantly lower among vaccine recipients boosted at month 12 (pooled\ngroups 2 + 3) than at month 15 (group 4a; adjusted p<0.0001 for each, except for gp70 V1V2 CaseA2, p=0.0142) and at month 18 (group 4b; all adjusted p<0.001). Boosting\nat month 18 versus month 15 resulted in a significantly higher plasma IgG response to gp120 antigens (all adjusted p<0.01) but not gp70 V1V2 antigens. CD4 functionality and polyfunctionality scores\nafter stimulation with HIV-1 Env peptides (92TH023) increased with delayed boosting. Groups with late boosts had increased functionality and polyfunctionality scores relative to vaccine recipients with no late boost (all\nadjusted p<0.05, except for the polyfunctionality score in group 1 vs group 4b, p<0.01). INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these results suggest that additional boosting of the RV144 regimen with longer intervals\nbetween the primary vaccination series and late boost improved immune responses and might improve the efficacy of preventing HIV acquisition.

This\nongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02578680. FINDINGS: Between Feb 26, 2016, and March 6, 2017, 616 patients were enrolled; median follow-up was 10.5 months (range 0.2-20.4) as of\ndata cutoff on Nov 8, 2017. 402 (99%) of 405 patients in the pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum group and 200 (99%) of 202 patients in the placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum-treated group completed\nat least one PRO assessment. At baseline, 359 (89%) of 402 patients in the pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum group and 180 (90%) of 200 in the placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum group were\ncompliant with QLQ-C30; at week 12, 319 (90%) of 354 and 149 (89%) of 167 patients were compliant, respectively; and at week 21, 249 (76%) of 326 and 91 (64%)\nof 143 patients were compliant, respectively. From baseline to week 12, GHS/QOL scores were maintained with both pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum (least-squares mean change: 1.0 point [95% CI -1.3 to 3.2]\nincrease) and placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum (-2.6 points [-5.8 to 0.5] decrease; between-group difference: 3.6 points [-0.1 to 7.2]; p=0.053). From baseline to week 21, GHS/QOL scores were better maintained with\npembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum (least-squares mean change: 1.3 points [95% CI -1.2 to 3.6] increase) than with placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum (-4.0 points [-7.7 to -0.3] decrease; between-group difference: 5.3 points [1.1\nto 9.5]; p=0.014). Median time to deterioration in cough, chest pain, or dyspnoea was not reached (95% CI 10.2 months to not reached) with pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum, and was 7.0\nmonths (4.8 months to not reached) with placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum (hazard ratio 0.81 [95% CI 0.60-1.09], p=0.16).

WHO requested updated modelling results for its 2019 Antiretroviral Guidelines update, which was restricted to the choice of dolutegravir or efavirenz in new ART initiators. In\nresponse to this request, we modelled the risks and benefits of alternative policies for initial first-line ART regimens. METHODS: We updated an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission and progression\nin adults to consider information on the risk of neural tube defects in women taking dolutegravir at time of conception, as well as the effects of dolutegravir on weight gain.\nThe model accounted for drug resistance in determining viral suppression, with consequences for clinical outcomes and mother-to-child transmission. We sampled distributions of parameters to create various epidemic setting scenarios, which\nreflected the diversity of epidemic and programmatic situations in sub-Saharan Africa. For each setting scenario, we considered the situation in 2018 and compared ART initiation policies of an efavirenz-based regimen\nin women intending pregnancy, and a dolutegravir-based regimen in others, and a dolutegravir-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy. We considered predicted outcomes over a 20-year period from 2019 to\n2039, used a 3% discount rate, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$500 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. FINDINGS: Considering updated information on risks and benefits, a policy of ART initiation\nwith a dolutegravir-based regimen rather than an efavirenz-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy, is predicted to bring population health benefits (10 990 DALYs averted per year) and to be\ncost-saving (by $2.9 million per year), leading to a reduction in the overall population burden of disease of 16 735 net DALYs per year for a country with an adult\npopulation size of 10 million. The policy involving ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen in women intending pregnancy was cost-effective in 87% of our setting scenarios and this finding was\nrobust in various sensitivity analyses, including around the potential negative effects of weight gain. INTERPRETATION: In the context of a range of modelled setting scenarios in sub-Saharan Africa, we found\nthat a policy of ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy, was predicted to bring population health benefits and be cost-effective, supporting WHO's strong recommendation for\ndolutegravir as a preferred drug for ART initiators.

However, evaluations of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such interventions among people\nwith HIV are scarce. Our aim was to establish the effectiveness of group support psychotherapy (GSP) delivered by lay health workers for depression treatment among people living with HIV in\na rural area of Uganda on a large scale. METHODS: In this cluster-randomised trial, we included 30 health centres offering HIV care. These were randomly assigned to deliver either GSP\nor group HIV education (GHE). Randomisation, in a ratio of 1:1, was achieved by health centre managers separately picking a paper containing the intervention allocation from a basket. Participants were\npeople living with HIV, aged 19 years and older, with mild to moderate major depression assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview depression module, taking antiretroviral therapy, and antidepressant-naive. Group\nsessions were led by trained lay health workers once a week for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants with major depression and function scores at 6\nmonths post-treatment, analysed by intention to treat by means of multilevel random effect regression analyses adjusting for clustering in health centres. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical\nTrials Registry, PACTR201608001738234. FINDINGS: Between Sept 13 and Dec 15, 2016, we assessed 1473 individuals, of whom 1140 were recruited from health centres offering GSP (n=578 [51%]) or GHE (n=562\n[49%]). Two (<1%) participants in the GSP group were diagnosed with major depression 6 months post-treatment compared with 160 (28%) in the GHE group (adjusted odds ratio=0.01, 95% CI 0.003-0.012,\np<0.0001). The mean function scores 6 months post-treatment were 9.85 (SD 0.76) in the GSP group and 6.83 (2.85) in the GHE group (beta=4.12; 95% CI 3.75-4.49, p<0.0001). 36 individuals\nhad 63 serious adverse events, which included 25 suicide attempts and 22 hospital admissions for medical complications. The outcomes of these serious adverse events included 16 deaths, 4 of which\nwere completed suicides (GSP=2; GHE=2), and 12 of which were HIV-related medical complications (GSP=8; GHE=4). Cost-effectiveness estimates showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$13.0 per disability-adjusted life-year averted, which can\nbe considered very cost-effective in Uganda. INTERPRETATION: Integration of cost-effective psychological treatments such as group support psychotherapy into existing HIV interventions might improve the mental health of people living with\nHIV.

Global health", "Creation Date": "2020/02/09 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Four methods have previously been used to track aid for reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH). At a meeting of donors and stakeholders in May, 2018, a single,\nagreed method was requested to produce accurate, predictable, transparent, and up-to-date estimates that could be used for analyses from both donor and recipient perspectives. Muskoka2 was developed to meet these\nneeds. We describe Muskoka2 and present estimates of levels and trends in aid for RMNCH in 2002-17, with a focus on the latest estimates for 2017. METHODS: Muskoka2 is an\nautomated algorithm that generates disaggregated estimates of aid for reproductive health, maternal and newborn health, and child health at the global, donor, and recipient-country levels. We applied Muskoka2 to the\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Creditor Reporting System (CRS) aid activities database to generate estimates of RMNCH disbursements in 2002-17. The percentage of disbursements that benefit RMNCH was determined\nusing CRS purpose codes for all donors except Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the UN Population Fund; and UNICEF; for which fixed percentages of aid were considered to benefit RMNCH. We\nanalysed funding by donor for the 20 largest donors, by recipient-country income group, and by recipient for the 16 countries with the greatest RMNCH need, defined as the countries with\nthe worst levels in 2015 on each of seven health indicators. FINDINGS: After 3 years of stagnation, reported aid for RMNCH reached $15.9 billion in 2017, the highest amount ever\nreported. Among donors reporting in both 2016 and 2017, aid increased by 10% ($1.4 billion) to $15.4 billion between 2016 and 2017. Child health received almost half of RMNCH disbursements\nin 2017 (46%, $7.4 billion), followed by reproductive health (34%, $5.4 billion), and maternal and newborn health (19%, $3.1 billion). The USA ($5.8 billion) and the UK ($1.6 billion) were\nthe largest bilateral donors, disbursing 46% of all RMNCH funding in 2017 (including shares of their core contributions to multilaterals). The Global Fund and Gavi were the largest multilateral donors,\ndisbursing $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for RMNCH from their core budgets. The proportion of aid for RMNCH received by low-income countries increased from 31% in 2002 to 52%\nin 2017. Nigeria received 7% ($1.1 billion) of all aid for RMNCH in 2017, followed by Ethiopia (6%, $876 million), Kenya (5%, $754 million), and Tanzania (5%, $751 million). INTERPRETATION:\nMuskoka2 retains the speed, transparency, and donor buy-in of the G8's previous Muskoka approach and incorporates eight innovations to improve precision. Although aid for RMNCH increased in 2017, low-income and\nmiddle-income countries still experience substantial funding gaps and threats to future funding. Maternal and newborn health receives considerably less funding than reproductive health or child health, which is a persistent\nissue requiring urgent attention.

However, whether the risk is specific to\nparticular phases of pregnancy is unclear. The aim of this study was to characterise and compare longitudinal patterns of maternal serum concentrations of cytokines across pregnancy between offspring who were\nlater ascertained to have a psychotic disorder, non-psychotic siblings of these cases, and unrelated, non-psychotic individuals who served as controls. METHODS: The National Collaborative Perinatal Project was a large-scale prospective\nlongitudinal study that assessed the effects of perinatal factors on infant and child development. At sites across the USA, over 50 000 pregnant women were enrolled during prenatal clinical visits\nbetween 1959 and 1965. The present study draws from the Philadelphia cohort, which includes 9236 surviving offspring of 6753 pregnant women. Psychotic disorder diagnoses in adulthood were assessed with review\nof medical records and were confirmed with a validation study. Concentrations of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17a were assessed using a multiplex bead assay in archived maternal\nserum samples collected across prenatal visits and birth. We characterized cytokine patterns with linear mixed models. FINDINGS: Our final sample comprised 90 cases, 79 siblings (of 40 cases), and 273\nmatched controls. Concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were significantly higher in maternal serum of offspring who later developed psychosis compared with maternal serum of matched controls. These\ndifferences were greatest in the first half of pregnancy (7-20 weeks), with no difference observed during the second half of pregnancy. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that exposure to high maternal\nproinflammatory cytokine concentrations in early pregnancy might play a part in psychosis. These findings place the timing of risk associated with maternal inflammation much earlier in prenatal development than previously\ndocumented in humans and provide insight into a potential developmental pathway to the disorder.

The FAKTION trial investigated whether the addition of capivasertib to fulvestrant improved\nprogression-free survival in patients with aromatase inhibitor-resistant advanced breast cancer. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, postmenopausal women aged at least 18 years with an Eastern Cooperative\nOncology Group performance status of 0-2 and oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic or locally advanced inoperable breast cancer who had relapsed or progressed on an aromatase inhibitor were recruited from 19\nhospitals in the UK. Enrolled participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intramuscular fulvestrant 500 mg (day 1) every 28 days (plus a loading dose on day 15 of cycle\n1) with either capivasertib 400 mg or matching placebo, orally twice daily on an intermittent weekly schedule of 4 days on and 3 days off (starting on cycle 1 day\n15) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. Treatment allocation was done using an interactive web-response system using a minimisation method (with a 20% random\nelement) and the following minimisation factors: measurable or non-measurable disease, primary or secondary aromatase inhibitor resistance, PIK3CA status, and PTEN status. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival with a one-sided\nalpha of 0.20. Analyses were done by intention to treat. Recruitment is complete, and the trial is in follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01992952. FINDINGS: Between March\n16, 2015, and March 6, 2018, 183 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 140 (76%) were eligible and were randomly assigned to receive fulvestrant plus capivasertib (n=69) or fulvestrant\nplus placebo (n=71). Median follow-up for progression-free survival was 4.9 months (IQR 1.6-11.6). At the time of primary analysis for progression-free survival (Jan 30, 2019), 112 progression-free survival events had\noccurred, 49 (71%) in 69 patients in the capivasertib group compared with 63 (89%) of 71 in the placebo group. Median progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% CI 5.0-13.2) in\nthe capivasertib group versus 4.8 months (3.1-7.7) in the placebo group, giving an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (95% CI 0.39-0.84) in favour of the capivasertib group (two-sided p=0.0044;\none-sided log rank test p=0.0018). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (22 [32%] of 69 patients in the capivasertib group vs 17 [24%] of 71 in the\nplacebo group), diarrhoea (ten [14%] vs three [4%]), rash (14 [20%] vs 0), infection (four [6%] vs two [3%]), and fatigue (one [1%] vs three [4%]). Serious adverse reactions occurred\nonly in the capivasertib group, and were acute kidney injury (two), diarrhoea (three), rash (two), hyperglycaemia (one), loss of consciousness (one), sepsis (one), and vomiting (one). One death, due to\natypical pulmonary infection, was assessed as possibly related to capivasertib treatment. One further death in the capivasertib group had an unknown cause; all remaining deaths in both groups (19 in\nthe capivasertib group and 31 in the placebo group) were disease related. INTERPRETATION: Progression-free survival was significantly longer in participants who received capivasertib than in those who received placebo. The\ncombination of capivasertib and fulvestrant warrants further investigation in phase 3 trials.

PRIMVAC antibody titres reached a peak (geometric mean 11 843.0, optical density [OD] 1.0, 95% CI 7559.8-18 552.9 with 100 mug dose and GLA-SE) 1 week after the\nthird vaccination (day 63). Compared with Alhydrogel, GLA-SE tended to improve the PRIMVAC antibody response (geometric mean 2163.5, OD 1.0, 95% CI 1315.7-3557.7 with 100 mug dose and Alhydrogel at\nday 63). 1 year after the last vaccination, 20 (71%) of 28 women who were vaccinated with PRIMVAC/Alhydrogel and 26 (93%) of 28 women who were vaccinated with PRIMVAC/GLA-SE still\nhad anti-PRIMVAC antibodies, although antibody magnitude was markedly lower (452.4, OD 1.0, 95% CI 321.8-636.1 with 100 mug dose and GLA-SE). These antibodies reacted with native homologous VAR2CSA expressed by\nNF54-CSA infected erythrocytes (fold change from baseline at day 63 with 100 mug dose and GLA-SE: 10.74, 95% CI 8.36-13.79). Limited cross-recognition, restricted to sera collected from women that received\nthe 100 mug PRIMVAC dose, was observed against heterologous VAR2CSA variants expressed by FCR3-CSA (fold change from baseline at day 63: 1.49, 95% CI 1.19-1.88) and 7G8-CSA infected erythrocytes (1.2,\n1.08-1.34). INTERPRETATION: PRIMVAC adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or GLA-SE had an acceptable safety profile, was immunogenic, and induced functional antibodies reacting with the homologous VAR2CSA variant expressed by NF54-CSA infected erythrocytes.\nCross-reactivity against heterologous VAR2CSA variants was limited and only observed in the higher dose group. An alternate schedule of immunisation, antigen dose, and combinations with other VAR2CSA-based vaccines are envisaged\nto improve the cross-reactivity against heterologous VAR2CSA variants.

One understudied source of cost is violence perpetrated by\nindividuals with severe mental illness. Estimating this economic impact can inform budget planning across several government sectors and emphasise the importance of violence prevention. Therefore, we aimed to provide a\ncomprehensive estimate of the economic costs of violence perpetrated by people with severe mental illness. METHODS: For this retrospective analysis, we used a prevalence-based modelling approach to estimate the annual\neconomic cost of violent incidents committed by people with severe mental illness in England and Wales during 2015-16. The model was based on secondary data, including the association between violence\nand severe mental illness, illness prevalence, recidivism, absolute numbers of violent incidents in 2015-16, and costs to society per violent crime, by area of spending. Uncertainty was addressed with probabilistic\nand deterministic sensitivity analyses that tested the effect of underreporting of domestic violence and distributions of crime types in individuals with severe mental illness. OUTCOMES: The estimated annual economic impact\nof violence perpetrated by people with severe mental illness was pound2.5 (95% CI 1.4-4.5) billion in England and Wales in 2015-16, or 5.3% of the total estimated societal cost of\nviolence. The largest contributors to the cost of violent crime perpetrated by individuals with severe mental illness were the cost of physical and emotional harm to victims ( pound1.4 [95%\nCI 0.8-2.5] billion), followed by lost productivity of victims ( pound348.0 [190.0-628.8] million), while the combined cost to the police and criminal justice system was pound561.3 (305.9-1009.2) million and the\ncost to health services was pound136.7 [74.3-246.3] million. The additional cost to secure forensic care was estimated to be pound487.7 (302.0-709.1) million. INTERPRETATION: The economic impact of violence perpetrated by\nindividuals with severe mental illness is potentially important. Preventing violence, especially through services for individuals with comorbid substance misuse, and reducing recidivism might lead to cost savings at a governmental\nand individual level, in addition to the clinical and societal benefits.

The aim\nof this study was to assess the relationship between placement in solitary confinement and mortality in the 5 years following release among formerly incarcerated individuals. METHODS: In this population-based study\nwe used data from Danish administrative registers and administrative dataset from the Danish Prison and Probation Service. We linked information on all Danish individuals who had been incarcerated for more\nthan 7 days during 2006-11, with information on mortality for the 60 months following release. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between being placed in solitary\nconfinement and mortality (death and cause of death) among formerly incarcerated Danish individuals, controlling for several possible confounders (prison security level, release year, sentence length, reason for conviction, age at\nadmission, sex, ethnic minority background, and education level) and using a reference group of incarcerated Danish individuals who had been sanctioned for in-prison infractions but not placed in solitary confinement\nin some models. FINDINGS: Our study included 13 776 individuals, which translated to 812 374 person-months of exposure to the risk of mortality up to Dec 31, 2016. Formerly incarcerated\nDanish individuals who spent time in solitary confinement had higher overall mortality 5 years after release (4.5%) than did those who had not spent time in solitary confinement (2.8%; p<0.0001).\nAfter adjusting for possible confounders, our results suggested an association between solitary confinement and elevated mortality due to non-natural causes (hazard ratio 2.342, 95% CI 1.527-3.592). We did not identify\na significant association with natural causes. INTERPRETATION: The results from these analyses indicate that solitary confinement placement might be a key moderator of the association between a history of incarceration\nand post-release outcomes. Our findings suggest that incarcerated individuals ever placed in solitary confinement are a vulnerable population in need of interventions.

Diabetes & endocrinology", "Creation Date": "2020/02/08 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood (LADA) differs in clinical features from type 2 diabetes. Whether this difference translates into different risks of complications remains controversial. We examined the long-term\nrisk of microvascular complications in people enrolled in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), according to their diabetes autoimmunity status. METHODS: We did a post-hoc analysis of 30-year follow-up data\nfrom UKPDS (UKPDS 86). UKPDS participants with diabetes autoantibody measurements available and without previous microvascular events were included. Participants with at least one detectable autoantibody were identified as having latent\nautoimmune diabetes, and those who tested negative for all autoantibodies were identified as having type 2 diabetes. The incidence of the primary composite microvascular outcome (first occurrence of renal failure,\nrenal death, blindness, vitreous haemorrhage, or retinal photocoagulation) was compared between adults with latent autoimmune diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes. The follow-up ended on Sept 30, 2007. Baseline\nand updated 9-year mean values of potential confounders were tested in Cox models to adjust hazard ratios (HRs). UKPDS is registered at the ISRCTN registry, 75451837. FINDINGS: Among the 5028\nparticipants included, 564 had latent autoimmune diabetes and 4464 had type 2 diabetes. After median 17.3 years (IQR 12.6-20.7) of follow-up, the composite microvascular outcome occurred in 1041 (21%) participants.\nThe incidence for the composite microvascular outcome was 15.8 (95% CI 13.4-18.7) per 1000 person-years in latent autoimmune diabetes and 14.2 (13.3-15.2) per 1000 person-years in type 2 diabetes. Adults\nwith latent autoimmune diabetes had a lower risk of the composite outcome during the first 9 years of follow-up than those with type 2 diabetes (adjusted HR 0.45 [95% CI\n0.30-0.68], p<0.0001), whereas in subsequent years their risk was higher than for those with type 2 diabetes (1.25 [1.01-1.54], p=0.047). Correcting for the higher updated 9-year mean HbA1c seen in\nadults with latent autoimmune diabetes than in those with type 2 diabetes explained entirely their subsequent increased risk for the composite microvascular outcome (adjusted HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.80-1.23], p=0.93).\nINTERPRETATION: At diabetes onset, adults with latent autoimmune diabetes have a lower risk of microvascular complications followed by a later higher risk of complications than do adults with type 2\ndiabetes, secondary to worse glycaemic control. Implementing strict glycaemic control from the time of diagnosis could reduce the later risk of microvascular complications in adults with latent autoimmune diabetes.

06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "The anti-cancer drug target poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and its close homologue, PARP2, are early responders to DNA damage in human cells(1,2). After binding to genomic lesions, these enzymes use\nNAD(+) to modify numerous proteins with mono- and poly(ADP-ribose) signals that are important for the subsequent decompaction of chromatin and the recruitment of repair factors(3,4). These post-translational modifications are predominantly\nserine-linked and require the accessory factor HPF1, which is specific for the DNA damage response and switches the amino acid specificity of PARP1 and PARP2 from aspartate or glutamate to\nserine residues(5-10). Here we report a co-structure of HPF1 bound to the catalytic domain of PARP2 that, in combination with NMR and biochemical data, reveals a composite active site formed\nby residues from HPF1 and PARP1 or PARP2 . The assembly of this catalytic centre is essential for the addition of ADP-ribose moieties after DNA damage in human cells. In\nresponse to DNA damage and occupancy of the NAD(+)-binding site, the interaction of HPF1 with PARP1 or PARP2 is enhanced by allosteric networks that operate within the PARP proteins, providing\nan additional level of regulation in the induction of the DNA damage response.

This study was done to\nassess the long-term safety and activity of siltuximab over up to 6 years of treatment. METHODS: This study is a prespecified open-label extension analysis of a phase 1 trial (NCT00412321)\nand a phase 2 trial (NCT01024036), done at 26 hospitals worldwide. Patients in both studies were at least 18 years old with histologically confirmed, symptomatic Castleman disease. This extension study\nenrolled 60 patients who completed the previous trials without disease progression on siltuximab. Patients received siltuximab infusions of 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks (which could be extended to 6 weeks)\nfor up to 6 years. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data. No formal hypothesis testing was performed. The primary endpoint was the safety of siltuximab, assessed at each\ndosing cycle. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01400503 and with EudraCT, number 2010-022837-27. FINDINGS: Patient enrolment into the phase 1 trial was from June 20, 2005, to Sept\n15, 2009, and enrolment into the phase 2 trial was from Feb 9, 2010, to Feb 3, 2012. Patients were enrolled in this long-term extension from April 1, 2011, to\nJan 15, 2014. Median follow-up was 6 years (IQR 5.11-7.76). Median treatment duration, from the beginning of the previous trials to the end of the present study, was 5.5 years\n(IQR 4.26-7.14). Siltuximab was well tolerated; however, adverse events of grade 3 or worse were reported in 36 (60%) of 60 patients with the most common being hypertension (eight [13%]),\nfatigue (five [8%]), nausea (four [7%]), neutropenia (four [7%]), and vomiting (three [5%]). 25 (42%) patients reported at least one serious adverse event, which most commonly was an infection (eight\n[13%]). Only two serious adverse events, polycythaemia and urinary retention, were considered related to siltuximab treatment. 18 patients discontinued before study completion, either to receive siltuximab locally (eight) or because\nof progressive disease (two), adverse events (two), or other reasons (six). No deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: These results show that siltuximab is well tolerated long term and provides important evidence\nfor the feasibility of the life-long use required by patients with idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease.

Gastroenterology & hepatology", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing globally, and a major priority is to identify patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who are at greater risk of\nprogression to cirrhosis, and who will be candidates for clinical trials and emerging new pharmacotherapies. We aimed to develop a score to identify patients with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score\n(NAS>/=4), and advanced fibrosis (stage 2 or higher [F>/=2]). METHODS: This prospective study included a derivation cohort before validation in multiple international cohorts. The derivation cohort was a cross-sectional, multicentre\nstudy of patients aged 18 years or older, scheduled to have a liver biopsy for suspicion of NAFLD at seven tertiary care liver centres in England. This was a prespecified\nsecondary outcome of a study for which the primary endpoints have already been reported. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by vibration-controlled transient elastography and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measured by FibroScan\ndevice were combined with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or AST:ALT ratio. To identify those patients with NASH, an elevated NAS, and significant fibrosis, the best fitting multivariable logistic\nregression model was identified and internally validated using boot-strapping. Score calibration and discrimination performance were determined in both the derivation dataset in England, and seven independent international (France, USA, China,\nMalaysia, Turkey) histologically confirmed cohorts of patients with NAFLD (external validation cohorts). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01985009. FINDINGS: Between March 20, 2014, and Jan 17, 2017, 350\npatients with suspected NAFLD attending liver clinics in England were prospectively enrolled in the derivation cohort. The most predictive model combined LSM, CAP, and AST, and was designated FAST (FibroScan-AST).\nPerformance was satisfactory in the derivation dataset (C-statistic 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.85) and was well calibrated. In external validation cohorts, calibration of the score was satisfactory and discrimination was good\nacross the full range of validation cohorts (C-statistic range 0.74-0.95, 0.85; 95% CI 0.83-0.87 in the pooled external validation patients' cohort; n=1026). Cutoff was 0.35 for sensitivity of 0.90 or\ngreater and 0.67 for specificity of 0.90 or greater in the derivation cohort, leading to a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.83 (84/101) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of\n0.85 (93/110). In the external validation cohorts, PPV ranged from 0.33 to 0.81 and NPV from 0.73 to 1.0. INTERPRETATION: The FAST score provides an efficient way to non-invasively identify\npatients at risk of progressive NASH for clinical trials or treatments when they become available, and thereby reduce unnecessary liver biopsy in patients unlikely to have significant disease.

We examined associations between measured body-mass index (BMI) at age\n17 years and cancer incidence, and with mortality among those who developed cancer. METHODS: In a nationwide, population-based cohort of adolescents, height and weight were measured at pre-recruitment mandatory medical\nexamination during 1967-2010. BMI was classified according to US Center for Disease Control and Prevention percentiles. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%\nCIs for incident cases of cancer using the 5th-49th BMI percentile group as a reference. The primary outcome was any cancer diagnosis between Jan 1, 1967, and Dec 31, 2012,\nas recorded in the Israeli National Cancer Registry. Participants with a diagnosis of cancer at baseline (before military recruitment assessment) were excluded from this analysis. The secondary outcome of this\nstudy was all-cause mortality among cohort members who had cancer, between Jan 1, 1967, and Dec 31, 2017. FINDINGS: Of the 2 458 170 participants examined between Jan 1, 1967,\nand Dec 31, 2010, 160 040 were excluded. 2 298 130 participants of which 928 110 were women and 1 370 020 were men. During 29 542 735 person-years of\nfollow-up in men, 26 353 incident cases of cancer were recorded and in 18 044 863 person-years of follow-up in women, 29 488 incident cases of cancer were recorded. Cancer\nincidence increased gradually across BMI percentiles. The adjusted HR was 1.26 (95% CI 1.18-1.35) among men with adolescent obesity. Among women, we found no association between obesity and overall cancer,\ndriven by inverse associations of obesity with cervical and breast cancers. When these cancers were excluded, the adjusted HR for cancer was 1.27 (1.13-1.44) among women with adolescent obesity. In\nboth sexes, high BMI (>/=85th percentile) was associated with an increased cancer risk after 10 years. This association was accentuated in the late period of the cohort versus the early\nperiod of the cohort. BMI was positively associated with a higher risk of mortality. The projected population attributable risk for high BMI was 5.1% (4.2-6.1) for men and 5.7% (4.2-7.3)\nfor women. INTERPRETATION: The increasing prevalence of adolescent obesity and the possible association between adolescent BMI and cancer incidence might increase the future burden of obesity-related cancers. BMI among adolescents\ncould constitute an important intervention target for cancer prevention.

Phase 1 safety data\nof savolitinib (also known as AZD6094, HMPL-504, volitinib), a potent, selective MET TKI, plus osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, have provided recommended doses for study. Here, we report the assessment\nof osimertinib plus savolitinib in two global expansion cohorts of the TATTON study. METHODS: In this multi-arm, multicentre, open-label, phase 1b study, we enrolled adult patients (aged >/=18 years) with\nlocally advanced or metastatic, MET-amplified, EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, who had progressed on EGFR TKIs. We considered two expansion cohorts: parts B and D. Part B consisted of three\ncohorts of patients: those who had been previously treated with a third-generation EGFR TKI (B1) and those who had not been previously treated with a third-generation EGFR TKI who were\neither Thr790Met negative (B2) or Thr790Met positive (B3). In part B, patients received oral osimertinib 80 mg and savolitinib 600 mg daily; after a protocol amendment (March 12, 2018), patients\nwho weighed no more than 55 kg received a 300 mg dose of savolitinib. Part D enrolled patients who had not previously received a third-generation EGFR TKI and were Thr790Met\nnegative; these patients received osimertinib 80 mg plus savolitinib 300 mg. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, which were assessed in all dosed patients. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of\npatients who had an objective response per RECIST 1.1 and was assessed in all dosed patients and all patients with centrally confirmed MET amplification. Here, we present an interim analysis\nwith data cutoff on March 29, 2019. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02143466. FINDINGS: Between May 26, 2015, and Feb 14, 2019, we enrolled 144 patients into part B\nand 42 patients into part D. In part B, 138 patients received osimertinib plus savolitinib 600 mg (n=130) or 300 mg (n=8). In part D, 42 patients received osimertinib plus\nsavolitinib 300 mg. 79 (57%) of 138 patients in part B and 16 (38%) of 42 patients in part D had adverse events of grade 3 or worse. 115 (83%)\npatients in part B and 25 (60%) patients in part D had adverse events possibly related to savolitinib and serious adverse events were reported in 62 (45%) patients in part\nB and 11 (26%) patients in part D; two adverse events leading to death (acute renal failure and death, cause unknown) were possibly related to treatment in part B.

SPEN is dispensable for maintenance of XCI in neural progenitors, although it significantly decreases the expression of genes that escape XCI. We\nshow that SPEN is immediately recruited to the X chromosome upon the upregulation of Xist, and is targeted to enhancers and promoters of active genes. SPEN rapidly disengages from chromatin\nupon gene silencing, suggesting that active transcription is required to tether SPEN to chromatin. We define the SPOC domain as a major effector of the gene-silencing function of SPEN, and\nshow that tethering SPOC to Xist RNA is sufficient to mediate gene silencing. We identify the protein partners of SPOC, including NCoR/SMRT, the m(6)A RNA methylation machinery, the NuRD complex,\nRNA polymerase II and factors involved in the regulation of transcription initiation and elongation.

One prominent structure consists of 2-7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome\nstrung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and-in liver cancer-frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT.

In this dynamical environment, both the coma(3,4) and the nucleus(5,6) evolve\nduring the orbit, changing their physical and compositional properties. The environment around an active nucleus is populated by dust grains with complex and variegated shapes(7), lifted and diffused by gases\nfreed from the sublimation of surface ices(8,9). The visible colour of dust particles is highly variable: carbonaceous organic material-rich grains(10) appear red while magnesium silicate-rich(11,12) and water-ice-rich(13,14) grains appear blue,\nwith some dependence on grain size distribution, viewing geometry, activity level and comet family type. We know that local colour changes are associated with grain size variations, such as in\nthe bluer jets made of submicrometre grains on comet Hale-Bopp(15) or in the fragmented grains in the coma(16) of C/1999 S4 (LINEAR). Apart from grain size, composition also influences the\ncoma's colour response, because transparent volatiles can introduce a substantial blueing in scattered light, as observed in the dust particles ejected after the collision of the Deep Impact probe with\ncomet 9P/Tempel 1(17). Here we report observations of two opposite seasonal colour cycles in the coma and on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through its perihelion passage(18). Spectral analysis indicates\nan enrichment of submicrometre grains made of organic material and amorphous carbon in the coma, causing reddening during the passage. At the same time, the progressive removal of dust from\nthe nucleus causes the exposure of more pristine and bluish icy layers on the surface. Far from the Sun, we find that the abundance of water ice on the nucleus\nis reduced owing to redeposition of dust and dehydration of the surface layer while the coma becomes less red.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32025011", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32025010", "Title": "Heterogeneous integration of single-crystalline complex-oxide membranes.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "Complex-oxide materials exhibit a vast range of functional properties desirable for next-generation electronic, spintronic, magnetoelectric, neuromorphic, and energy conversion storage devices(1-4).

Moreover, key physical properties of complex-oxide thin films, such as piezoelectricity and magnetostriction, are\nseverely reduced by the substrate clamping effect.

We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds.

Chromothripsis, in which many clustered\nstructural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect\nseveral cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and\nrare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer\nbeyond those in the TERT promoter(4); identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural variation(5,6); analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution(7);\ndescribes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and promoter activity(8,9); and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of cancer genomes(8,10-18).", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32025007", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32025006", "Title": "Muon colliders come a step closer.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/11 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32025006", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32025005", "Title": "A platform for making and transferring oxide films.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/20 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32025005", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32025004", "Title": "Global genomics project unravels cancer's complexity at unprecedented scale.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/20 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32025004", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32024686", "Title": "Unhappy doctors: changing the status woe.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 5", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024686", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32024673", "Title": "Short term fixes have made parts of NHS financially unstable, auditors warn.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 5", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024673", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32024659", "Title": "Impact of blinding on estimated treatment effects in randomised clinical trials: meta-epidemiological study.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 5", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024659", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32024658", "Title": "Targeted measles and rubella vaccination campaign aims to stop global surge in cases.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 5", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024658", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32024657", "Title": "Updating insights into rosiglitazone and cardiovascular risk through shared data: individual patient and summary level meta-analyses.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/25 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 5", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of rosiglitazone treatment on cardiovascular risk and mortality using multiple data sources and varying analytical approaches with three aims\nin mind: to clarify uncertainties about the cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone; to determine whether different analytical approaches are likely to alter the conclusions of adverse event meta-analyses; and to inform\nefforts to promote clinical trial transparency and data sharing. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK's) ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com for individual patient level data (IPD) and\nGSK's Study Register platforms, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to January 2019 for summary level data. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nFOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomized, controlled, phase II-IV clinical trials that compared rosiglitazone with any control for at least 24 weeks in adults. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: For analyses of trials\nfor which IPD were available, a composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular related death, and non-cardiovascular related death was examined. These four events were examined independently as\nsecondary analyses. For analyses including trials for which IPD were not available, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular related death were examined, which were determined from summary level data. Multiple meta-analyses were\nconducted that accounted for trials with zero events in one or both arms with two different continuity corrections (0.5 constant and treatment arm) to calculate odds ratios and risk ratios\nwith 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: 33 eligible trials were identified from ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com for which IPD were available (21 156 patients). Additionally, 103 trials for which IPD were not available were\nincluded in the meta-analyses for myocardial infarction (23 683 patients), and 103 trials for which IPD were not available contributed to the meta-analyses for cardiovascular related death (22 772 patients).\nAmong 29 trials for which IPD were available and that were included in previous meta-analyses using GSK's summary level data, more myocardial infarction events were identified by using IPD instead\nof summary level data for 26 trials, and fewer cardiovascular related deaths for five trials. When analyses were limited to trials for which IPD were available, and a constant continuity\ncorrection of 0.5 and a random effects model were used to account for trials with zero events in only one arm, patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 33% increased risk\nof a composite event compared with controls (odds ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.61; rosiglitazone population: 274 events among 11 837 patients; control population: 219 events among 9319\npatients). The odds ratios for myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular related death, and non-cardiovascular related death were 1.17 (0.92 to 1.51), 1.54 (1.14 to 2.09), 1.15 (0.55 to 2.41), and\n1.18 (0.60 to 2.30), respectively. For analyses including trials for which IPD were not available, odds ratios for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular related death were attenuated (1.09, 0.88 to 1.35,\nand 1.12, 0.72 to 1.74, respectively). Results were broadly consistent when analyses were repeated using trials with zero events across both arms and either of the two continuity corrections was\nused. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that rosiglitazone is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, especially for heart failure events. Although increased risk of myocardial infarction was observed across analyses, the\nstrength of the evidence varied and effect estimates were attenuated when summary level data were used in addition to IPD. Because more myocardial infarctions and fewer cardiovascular related deaths were\nreported in the IPD than in the summary level data, sharing IPD might be necessary when performing meta-analyses focused on safety.

DESIGN: Quasi-experimental difference-in-difference analysis to examine out-of-pocket spending and financial burden among low income adults after Medicaid expansions. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: A nationally representative\nsample of individuals aged 19-64 years, with family incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level, from the 2010-17 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Four annual healthcare\nspending outcomes: out-of-pocket spending; premium contributions; out-of-pocket plus premium spending; and catastrophic financial burden (defined as out-of-pocket plus premium spending exceeding 40% of post-subsistence income). P values were adjusted for\nmultiple comparisons. RESULTS: 37 819 adults were included in the study. Healthcare spending did not change in the first two years, but Medicaid expansions were associated with lower out-of-pocket spending\n(adjusted percentage change -28.0% (95% confidence interval -38.4% to -15.8%); adjusted absolute change -$122 ( pound93; euro110); adjusted P<0.001), lower out-of-pocket plus premium spending (-29.0% (-40.5% to -15.3%); -$442; adjusted\nP<0.001), and lower probability of experiencing a catastrophic financial burden (adjusted percentage point change -4.7 (-7.9 to -1.4); adjusted P=0.01) in years three to four. No evidence was found to\nindicate that premium contributions changed after the Medicaid expansions. CONCLUSION: Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act were associated with lower out-of-pocket spending and a lower likelihood of catastrophic financial\nburden for low income adults in the third and fourth years of the act's implementation.

literature. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and Web\nof Science, up to 15 February 2019. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Articles discussing indoor tanning and health were eligible for inclusion, with no article type restrictions (original research, systematic reviews, review\narticles, case reports, editorials, commentaries, and letters were all eligible). Basic science studies, articles describing only indoor tanning prevalence, non-English articles, and articles without full text available were excluded. RESULTS:\n691 articles were included in analysis, including empiric articles (eg, original articles or systematic reviews) (357/691; 51.7%) and non-empiric articles letters (eg, commentaries, letters, or editorials) (334/691; 48.3%). Overall, 7.2%\n(50/691) of articles had financial links to the indoor tanning industry; 10.7% (74/691) articles favored indoor tanning, 3.9% (27/691) were neutral, and 85.4% (590/691) were critical of indoor tanning. Among\nthe articles without industry funding, 4.4% (27/620) favored indoor tanning, 3.5% (22/620) were neutral, and 92.1% (571/620) were critical of indoor tanning. Among the articles with financial links to the\nindoor tanning industry, 78% (39/50) favored indoor tanning, 10% (5/50) were neutral, and 12% (6/50) were critical of indoor tanning. Support from the indoor tanning industry was significantly associated with\nfavoring indoor tanning (risk ratio 14.3, 95% confidence interval 10.0 to 20.4). CONCLUSIONS: Although most articles in the indoor tanning literature are independent of industry funding, articles with financial links\nto the indoor tanning industry are more likely to favor indoor tanning. Public health practitioners and researchers need to be aware of and account for industry funding when interpreting the\nevidence related to indoor tanning.

Objective: To compare risks of hypophosphatemia and effects on biomarkers of mineral\nand bone homeostasis of intravenous iron isomaltoside (now known as ferric derisomaltose) vs ferric carboxymaltose. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between October 2017 and June 2018, 245 patients aged 18 years\nand older with iron-deficiency anemia (hemoglobin level </=11 g/dL; serum ferritin level </=100 ng/mL) and intolerance or unresponsiveness to 1 month or more of oral iron were recruited from 30\noutpatient clinic sites in the United States into 2 identically designed, open-label, randomized clinical trials. Patients with reduced kidney function were excluded. Serum phosphate and 12 additional biomarkers of mineral\nand bone homeostasis were measured on days 0, 1, 7, 8, 14, 21, and 35. The date of final follow-up was June 19, 2018, for trial A and May 29,\n2018, for trial B. Interventions: Intravenous administration of iron isomaltoside, 1000 mg, on day 0 or ferric carboxymaltose, 750 mg, infused on days 0 and 7. Main Outcomes and Measures:\nThe primary end point was the incidence of hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate level <2.0 mg/dL) between baseline and day 35. Results: In trial A, 123 patients were randomized (mean [SD] age,\n45.1 [11.0] years; 95.9% women), including 62 to iron isomaltoside and 61 to ferric carboxymaltose; 95.1% completed the trial. In trial B, 122 patients were randomized (mean [SD] age, 42.6\n[12.2] years; 94.1% women), including 61 to iron isomaltoside and 61 to ferric carboxymaltose; 93.4% completed the trial. The incidence of hypophosphatemia was significantly lower following iron isomaltoside vs ferric\ncarboxymaltose (trial A: 7.9% vs 75.0% [adjusted rate difference, -67.0% {95% CI, -77.4% to -51.5%}], P < .001; trial B: 8.1% vs 73.7% [adjusted rate difference, -65.8% {95% CI, -76.6%\nto -49.8%}], P < .001). Beyond hypophosphatemia and increased parathyroid hormone, the most common adverse drug reactions (No./total No.) were nausea (iron isomaltoside: 1/125; ferric carboxymaltose: 8/117) and headache (iron\nisomaltoside: 4/125; ferric carboxymaltose: 5/117). Conclusions and Relevance: In 2 randomized trials of patients with iron-deficiency anemia who were intolerant of or unresponsive to oral iron, iron isomaltoside (now called\nferric derisomaltose), compared with ferric carboxymaltose, resulted in lower incidence of hypophosphatemia over 35 days. However, further research is needed to determine the clinical importance of this difference.

Objective: To evaluate the association of home NIPPV\nvia bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) devices and noninvasive home mechanical ventilator (HMV) devices with clinical outcomes and adverse events in patients with COPD and hypercapnia. Data Sources: Search of\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Registrar of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Scopus for English-language articles published from January 1, 1995, to November 6,\n2019. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and comparative observational studies that enrolled adults with COPD with hypercapnia who used home NIPPV for more than 1 month were included. Data\nExtraction and Synthesis: Data extraction was completed by independent pairs of reviewers. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool for RCTs and select items\nfrom the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized studies.

Noninvasive HMV use compared with no device was significantly associated with fewer all-cause hospital admissions (rate ratio, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.35-0.71]; P <\n.001; 1 study; 93 patients; SOE, low), but not mortality (21.84% vs 34.09%; RD, -11.99% [95% CI, -24.77% to 0.79%]; OR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.29-1.08]; P = .49; 2 studies;\n175 patients; SOE, insufficient). There was no statistically significant difference in the total number of adverse events in patients using NIPPV compared with no device (0.18 vs 0.17 per patient;\nP = .84; 6 studies; 414 patients). Conclusions and Relevance: In this meta-analysis of patients with COPD and hypercapnia, home BPAP, compared with no device, was associated with lower risk\nof mortality, all-cause hospital admission, and intubation, but no significant difference in quality of life. Noninvasive HMV, compared with no device, was significantly associated with lower risk of hospital admission,\nbut there was no significant difference in mortality risk.

Objectives: To examine whether people with neurological disorders\ndie by suicide more often than other people and to assess for temporal associations. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nationwide, retrospective cohort study on all persons 15 years or older living\nin Denmark, from 1980 through 2016 (N = 7300395). Exposures: Medical contact for head injury, stroke, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, diseases of myoneural junction, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, central nervous system infections,\nmeningitis, encephalitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, dementia, intellectual disability, and other brain diseases from 1977 through 2016 (n = 1248252). Main Outcomes and Measures: Death by suicide during 1980-2016.\nAdjusted incidence rate ratio (IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regressions, adjusted for sociodemographics, comorbidity, psychiatric diagnoses, and self-harm. Results: Of the more than 7.3 million individuals observed over 161935233 person-years\n(49.1% males), 35483 died by suicide (median duration of follow-up, 23.6 years; interquartile range, 10.0-37.0 years; mean age, 51.9 years; SD, 17.9 years). Of those, 77.4% were males, and 14.7%\n(n = 5141) were diagnosed with a neurological disorder, equivalent to a suicide rate of 44.0 per 100000 person-years compared with 20.1 per 100000 person-years among individuals not diagnosed with\na neurological disorder. People diagnosed with a neurological disorder had an adjusted IRR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7-1.8) compared with those not diagnosed. The excess adjusted IRRs were 4.9 (95%\nCI, 3.5-6.9) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 4.9 (95% CI, 3.1-7.7) for Huntington disease, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.9-2.6) for multiple sclerosis, 1.7 (95% CI, 1.6-1.7) for head injury, 1.3 (95% CI,\n1.2-1.3) for stroke, and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.6-1.8) for epilepsy. The association varied according to time since diagnosis with an adjusted IRR for 1 to 3 months of 3.1 (95%\nCI, 2.7-3.6) and for 10 or more years, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.4 to 1.6, P < .001). Compared with those who were not diagnosed with a neurological disorder, those with\ndementia had a lower overall adjusted IRR of 0.8 (95% CI, 0.7-0.9), which was elevated during the first month after diagnosis to 3.0 (95% CI, 1.9-4.6; P < .001). The\nabsolute risk of suicide for people with Huntington disease was 1.6% (95% CI, 1.0%-2.5%).

metal deposition and stripping in a solid-state battery via Coble creep.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/06 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "Solid-state lithium metal batteries require accommodation of electrochemically generated mechanical stress inside the lithium: this stress can be(1,2) up to 1 gigapascal for an overpotential of 135 millivolts. Maintaining the\nmechanical and electrochemical stability of the solid structure despite physical contact with moving corrosive lithium metal is a demanding requirement. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we investigated the deposition\nand stripping of metallic lithium or sodium held within a large number of parallel hollow tubules made of a mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC). Here we show that these alkali metals-as\nsingle crystals-can grow out of and retract inside the tubules via mainly diffusional Coble creep along the MIEC/metal phase boundary. Unlike solid electrolytes, many MIECs are electrochemically stable in contact\nwith lithium (that is, there is a direct tie-line to metallic lithium on the equilibrium phase diagram), so this Coble creep mechanism can effectively relieve stress, maintain electronic and ionic\ncontacts, eliminate solid-electrolyte interphase debris, and allow the reversible deposition/stripping of lithium across a distance of 10 micrometres for 100 cycles. A centimetre-wide full cell-consisting of approximately 10(10) MIEC cylinders/solid\nelectrolyte/LiFePO4-shows a high capacity of about 164 milliampere hours per gram of LiFePO4, and almost no degradation for over 50 cycles, starting with a 1x excess of Li. Modelling shows\nthat the design is insensitive to MIEC material choice with channels about 100 nanometres wide and 10-100 micrometres deep. The behaviour of lithium metal within the MIEC channels suggests that\nthe chemical and mechanical stability issues with the metal-electrolyte interface in solid-state lithium metal batteries can be overcome using this architecture.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32015545", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32015519", "Title": "Early climate models successfully predicted global warming.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/06 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32015519", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32015517", "Title": "Tech tools to make research more open and inclusive.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/06 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32015517", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32015096", "Title": "I trained overseas, what do I need to do to work in the UK as a doctor?", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/06 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32015096", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32015053", "Title": "Equity of resource flows for reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health: are those most in need being left behind?", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/25 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32015053", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32015050", "Title": "Assisted dying: Belgian doctors are acquitted of unlawful poisoning.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/06 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32015050", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32014886", "Title": "We shouldn't recommend harmful foods \"in moderation\".", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32014886", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32014884", "Title": "Understanding personal health budgets.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/25 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32014884", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32014862", "Title": "GPs are risking own health to provide millions of extra appointments, BMA warns.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/06 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32014862", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32014854", "Title": "Tailored regimens for combined hormonal contraceptives.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32014854", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32014852", "Title": "Histology independent cancer drugs: the drug makers' responsibility.", "JournalName": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 3", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32014852", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32014851", "Title": "Sixty seconds on . . .

Patients were eligible if 18 years or older with early\nstage polycythaemia vera (no history of cytoreductive treatment or less than 3 years of previous hydroxyurea treatment) diagnosed by WHO's 2008 criteria. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to ropeginterferon alfa-2b\n(subcutaneously every 2 weeks, starting at 100 mug) or hydroxyurea (orally starting at 500 mg/day). After 1 year, patients could opt to enter the extension part of the trial, CONTINUATION-PV.\nThe primary endpoint in PROUD-PV was non-inferiority of ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus hydroxyurea regarding complete haematological response with normal spleen size (longitudinal diameter of </=12 cm for women and </=13 cm\nfor men) at 12 months; in CONTINUATION-PV, the coprimary endpoints were complete haematological response with normalisation of spleen size and with improved disease burden (ie, splenomegaly, microvascular disturbances, pruritus, and\nheadache). We present the final results of PROUD-PV and an interim analysis at 36 months of the CONTINUATION-PV study (per statistical analysis plan). Analyses for safety and efficacy were per-protocol.\nThe trials were registered on EudraCT, 2012-005259-18 (PROUD-PV) and 2014-001357-17 (CONTINUATION-PV, which is ongoing). FINDINGS: Patients were recruited from Sept 17, 2013 to March 13, 2015 with 306 enrolled. 257\npatients were randomly assigned, 127 were treated in each group (three patients withdrew consent in the hydroxyurea group), and 171 rolled over to the CONTINUATION-PV trial. Median follow-up was 182.1\nweeks (IQR 166.3-201.7) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 164.5 weeks (144.4-169.3) in the standard therapy group. In PROUD-PV, 26 (21%) of 122 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and 34\n(28%) of 123 patients in the standard therapy group met the composite primary endpoint of complete haematological response with normal spleen size. In CONTINUATION-PV, complete haematological response with improved disease\nburden was met in 50 (53%) of 95 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus 28 (38%) of 74 patients in the hydroxyurea group, p=0.044 at 36 months. Complete haematological\nresponse without the spleen criterion in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus standard therapy group were: 53 (43%) of 123 patients versus 57 (46%) of 125 patients, p=0.63 at 12 months\n(PROUD-PV), and 67 (71%) of 95 patients versus 38 (51%) of 74 patients, p=0.012 at 36 months (CONTINUATION-PV). The most frequently reported grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events\nwere increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (seven [6%] of 127 patients) and increased alanine aminotransferase (four [3%] of 127 patients) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group, and leucopenia (six [5%] of 127 patients) and\nthrombocytopenia (five [4%] of 127 patients) in the standard therapy group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in three (2%) of 127 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and five (4%)\nof 127 patients in the hydroxyurea group. One treatment-related death was reported in the standard therapy group (acute leukaemia). INTERPRETATION: In patients with early polycythaemia vera, who predominantly presented without\nsplenomegaly, ropeginterferon alfa-2b was effective in inducing haematological responses; non-inferiority to hydroxyurea regarding haematological response and normal spleen size was not shown at 12 months. However, response to ropeginterferon alfa-2b\ncontinued to increase over time with improved responses compared with hydroxyurea at 36 months. Considering the high and durable haematological and molecular responses and its good tolerability, ropeginterferon alfa-2b offers\na valuable and safe long-term treatment option with features distinct from hydroxyurea.

The focus of the present analysis was to assess the effect on overall survival. METHODS: New EPOC was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled,\nphase 3 trial. Adult patients (aged >/=18 years) with KRAS wild-type (codons 12, 13, and 61) resectable or suboptimally resectable colorectal liver metastases and a WHO performance status of 0-2\nwere randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chemotherapy with or without cetuximab before and after liver resection. Randomisation was done centrally with minimisation factors of surgical centre, poor prognosis cancer, and\nprevious adjuvant treatment with oxaliplatin. Chemotherapy consisted of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) administered intravenously over 2 h, l-folinic acid (175 mg flat dose administered intravenously over 2 h) or d,l-folinic acid\n(350 mg flat dose administered intravenously over 2 h), and fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m(2) administered intravenously over 5 min, followed by a 46 h infusion of fluorouracil 2400 mg/m(2) repeated\nevery 2 weeks (regimen one), or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) administered intravenously over 2 h and oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 repeated every 3 weeks (regimen two).\nPatients who had received adjuvant oxaliplatin could receive irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) intravenously over 30 min with fluorouracil instead of oxaliplatin (regimen three). Cetuximab was given intravenously, 500 mg/m(2) every 2\nweeks with regimen one and three or a loading dose of 400 mg/m(2) followed by a weekly infusion of 250 mg/m(2) with regimen two. The primary endpoint of progression-free survival\nwas published previously. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, preoperative response, pathological resection status, and safety. Trial recruitment was halted prematurely on the advice of the Trial Steering Committee on Nov\n1, 2012. All analyses (except safety) were done on the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses included all randomly assigned patients. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 22944367. FINDINGS: Between Feb\n26, 2007, and Oct 12, 2012, 257 eligible patients were randomly assigned to chemotherapy with cetuximab (n=129) or without cetuximab (n=128). This analysis was carried out 5 years after the\nlast patient was recruited, as defined in the protocol, at a median follow-up of 66.7 months (IQR 58.0-77.5). Median progression-free survival was 22.2 months (95% CI 18.3-26.8) in the chemotherapy\nalone group and 15.5 months (13.8-19.0) in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17, 95% CI 0.87-1.56; p=0.304). Median overall survival was 81.0 months (59.6 to not reached)\nin the chemotherapy alone group and 55.4 months (43.5-71.5) in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab group (HR 1.45, 1.02-2.05; p=0.036). There was no significant difference in the secondary outcomes of preoperative\nresponse or pathological resection status between groups. Five deaths might have been treatment-related (one in the chemotherapy alone group and four in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab group). The most common\ngrade 3-4 adverse events reported were: neutrophil count decreased (26 [19%] of 134 in the chemotherapy alone group vs 21 [15%] of 137 in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab group), diarrhoea\n(13 [10%] vs 14 [10%]), skin rash (one [1%] vs 22 [16%]), thromboembolic events (ten [7%] vs 11 [8%]), lethargy (ten [7%] vs nine [7%]), oral mucositis (three [2%] vs\n14 [10%]), vomiting (seven [5%] vs seven [5%]), peripheral neuropathy (eight [6%] vs five [4%]), and pain (six [4%] vs six [4%]). INTERPRETATION: Although the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy\nimproves the overall survival in some studies in patients with advanced, inoperable metastatic disease, its use in the perioperative setting in patients with operable disease confers a significant disadvantage in\nterms of overall survival. Cetuximab should not be used in this setting.

To date,\nestimating the effectiveness of PrEP has relied on clinical trials or mathematical models. We propose a novel and pragmatic metric to evaluate and compare programme effectiveness using routine implementation data.\nUsing South African and Zambian PrEP guidelines, we provide two examples of how to consistently measure PrEP-programme effectiveness with routinely collected data. PrEP effectiveness should account for HIV seroconversion, the\nvariable risk of HIV infection (seasons of risk) estimated with routine risk assessment at each clinic visit (when available), and the persistence of PrEP use. Three criteria should be met\nin order to be considered a successful outcome: first, a person who initiates PrEP must not seroconvert; second, there should be no more than one period at high risk of\nHIV infection during the follow-up period when not taking PrEP; and finally, an individual must continue to attend health-care visits or discontinue prophylaxis in consultation with a health-care provider within\na specified follow-up period. The number of PrEP successes could then be compared with the total number of people initiating PrEP to establish a success ratio. This outcome is a\nuseful and easily interpretable metric to monitor effectiveness of PrEP programmes with routinely collected clinical data and can be used in cost-effectiveness analyses.

Including clinical outcome assessments, such as patient- reported outcomes (PROs), to determine net clinical benefit of a treatment strategy is needed because\nof the substantial burden of symptoms and impaired functioning in this patient population. The US National Cancer Institute convened a meeting to review previous recommendations and existing PRO measures of\nsymptoms and function that can be applied to current trials and clinical practice for high-grade gliomas. Measures were assessed for relevance, relationship to disease and therapy, sensitivity to change, psychometric\nproperties, response format, patient acceptability, and use of self-report. The group also relied on patient input including the results of an online survey, a literature review on available clinical outcomes,\nexpert opinion, and alignment with work done by other organisations. A core set of priority constructs was proposed that allows more comprehensive evaluation of therapies and comparison of outcomes among\nstudies, and enhances efforts to improve the measurement of these core clinical outcomes.

The aim of the present study was to develop a\nbiomarker of patient outcome after primary colorectal cancer resection by directly analysing scanned conventional haematoxylin and eosin stained sections using deep learning. METHODS: More than 12 000 000 image tiles\nfrom patients with a distinctly good or poor disease outcome from four cohorts were used to train a total of ten convolutional neural networks, purpose-built for classifying supersized heterogeneous images.\nA prognostic biomarker integrating the ten networks was determined using patients with a non-distinct outcome. The marker was tested on 920 patients with slides prepared in the UK, and then\nindependently validated according to a predefined protocol in 1122 patients treated with single-agent capecitabine using slides prepared in Norway. All cohorts included only patients with resectable tumours, and a formalin-fixed,\nparaffin-embedded tumour tissue block available for analysis. The primary outcome was cancer-specific survival. FINDINGS: 828 patients from four cohorts had a distinct outcome and were used as a training cohort\nto obtain clear ground truth. 1645 patients had a non-distinct outcome and were used for tuning. The biomarker provided a hazard ratio for poor versus good prognosis of 3.84 (95%\nCI 2.72-5.43; p<0.0001) in the primary analysis of the validation cohort, and 3.04 (2.07-4.47; p<0.0001) after adjusting for established prognostic markers significant in univariable analyses of the same cohort, which\nwere pN stage, pT stage, lymphatic invasion, and venous vascular invasion. INTERPRETATION: A clinically useful prognostic marker was developed using deep learning allied to digital scanning of conventional haematoxylin and\neosin stained tumour tissue sections. The assay has been extensively evaluated in large, independent patient populations, correlates with and outperforms established molecular and morphological prognostic markers, and gives consistent results\nacross tumour and nodal stage. The biomarker stratified stage II and III patients into sufficiently distinct prognostic groups that potentially could be used to guide selection of adjuvant treatment by\navoiding therapy in very low risk groups and identifying patients who would benefit from more intensive treatment regimes.

Our primary aim was to compare conversion to sinus rhythm between pharmacological cardioversion followed by electrical\ncardioversion (drug-shock), and electrical cardioversion alone (shock-only). Our secondary aim was to compare the effectiveness of two pad positions for electrical cardioversion. METHODS: We did a partial factorial trial of\ntwo protocols for patients with acute atrial fibrillation at 11 academic hospital emergency departments in Canada. We enrolled adult patients with acute atrial fibrillation. Protocol 1 was a randomised, blinded,\nplacebo-controlled comparison of attempted pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous procainamide (15 mg/kg over 30 min) followed by electrical cardioversion if necessary (up to three shocks, each of >/=200 J), and placebo\ninfusion followed by electrical cardioversion. For patients having electrical cardioversion, we used Protocol 2, a randomised, open-label, nested comparison of anteroposterior versus anterolateral pad positions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1,\nstratified by study site) for Protocol 1 by on-site research personnel using an online electronic data capture system. Randomisation for Protocol 2 occurred 30 min after drug infusion for patients\nwho had not converted and was stratified by site and Protocol 1 allocation. Patients and all research and emergency department staff were masked to treatment allocation for Protocol 1. The\nprimary outcome was conversion to normal sinus rhythm for at least 30 min at any time after randomisation and up to a point immediately after three shocks. Protocol 1 was\nanalysed by intention to treat and Protocol 2 excluded patients who did not receive electrical cardioversion. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891058. FINDINGS: Between July 18, 2013, and\nOct 17, 2018, we enrolled 396 patients, and none were lost to follow-up. In the drug-shock group (n=204), conversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 196 (96%) patients and in the\nshock-only group (n=192), conversion occurred in 176 (92%) patients (absolute difference 4%; 95% CI 0-9; p=0.07). The proportion of patients discharged home was 97% (n=198) versus 95% (n=183; p=0.60). 106\n(52%) patients in the drug-shock group converted after drug infusion only. No patients had serious adverse events in follow-up. The different pad positions in Protocol 2 (n=244), had similar conversions\nto sinus rhythm (119 [94%] of 127 in anterolateral group vs 108 [92%] of 117 in anteroposterior group; p=0.68). INTERPRETATION: Both the drug-shock and shock-only strategies were highly effective, rapid,\nand safe in restoring sinus rhythm for patients in the emergency department with acute atrial fibrillation, avoiding the need for return to hospital. The drug infusion worked for about half\nof patients and avoided the resource intensive procedural sedation required for electrical cardioversion. We also found no significant difference between the anterolateral and anteroposterior pad positions for electrical cardioversion. Immediate\nrhythm control for patients in the emergency department with acute atrial fibrillation leads to excellent outcomes.

developing a global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem, which proposes an elimination threshold of four cases per 100 000 women and includes\n2030 triple-intervention coverage targets for scale-up of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to 90%, twice-lifetime cervical screening to 70%, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer to 90%. We assessed\nthe impact of achieving the 90-70-90 triple-intervention targets on cervical cancer mortality and deaths averted over the next century. We also assessed the potential for the elimination initiative to support\ntarget 3.4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030. METHODS: The WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) involves three\nindependent, dynamic models of HPV infection, cervical carcinogenesis, screening, and precancer and invasive cancer treatment. Reductions in age-standardised rates of cervical cancer mortality in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs)\nwere estimated for three core scenarios: girls-only vaccination at age 9 years with catch-up for girls aged 10-14 years; girls-only vaccination plus once-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up; and girls-only\nvaccination plus twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up. Vaccination was assumed to provide 100% lifetime protection against infections with HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and\nto scale up to 90% coverage in 2020. Cervical screening involved HPV testing at age 35 years, or at ages 35 years and 45 years, with scale-up to 45% coverage\nby 2023, 70% by 2030, and 90% by 2045, and we assumed that 50% of women with invasive cervical cancer would receive appropriate surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy by 2023, which\nwould increase to 90% by 2030. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions. FINDINGS: In 2020, the estimated cervical cancer mortality rate across all 78 LMICs was\n13.2 (range 12.9-14.1) per 100 000 women. Compared to the status quo, by 2030, vaccination alone would have minimal impact on cervical cancer mortality, leading to a 0.1% (0.1-0.5) reduction,\nbut additionally scaling up twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 34.2% (23.3-37.8), averting 300 000 (300 000-400 000) deaths by 2030 (with similar results for once-lifetime screening).\nBy 2070, scaling up vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 61.7% (61.4-66.1), averting 4.8 million (4.1-4.8) deaths. By 2070, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by\n88.9% (84.0-89.3), averting 13.3 million (13.1-13.6) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 92.3% (88.4-93.0), averting 14.6 million (14.1-14.6) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). By 2120, vaccination alone would reduce mortality by\n89.5% (86.6-89.9), averting 45.8 million (44.7-46.4) deaths. By 2120, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 97.9% (95.0-98.0), averting 60.8 million (60.2-61.2) deaths (with once-lifetime screening),\nor by 98.6% (96.5-98.6), averting 62.6 million (62.1-62.8) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). With the WHO triple-intervention strategy, over the next 10 years, about half (48% [45-55]) of deaths averted would\nbe in sub-Saharan Africa and almost a third (32% [29-34]) would be in South Asia; over the next 100 years, almost 90% of deaths averted would be in these regions.\nFor premature deaths (age 30-69 years), the WHO triple-intervention strategy would result in rate reductions of 33.9% (24.4-37.9) by 2030, 96.2% (94.3-96.8) by 2070, and 98.6% (96.9-98.8) by 2120. INTERPRETATION:\nThese findings emphasise the importance of acting immediately on three fronts to scale up vaccination, screening, and treatment for pre-invasive and invasive cervical cancer. In the next 10 years, a\none-third reduction in the rate of premature mortality from cervical cancer in LMICs is possible, contributing to the realisation of the 2030 UN SDGs. Over the next century, successful implementation\nof the WHO elimination strategy would reduce cervical cancer mortality by almost 99% and save more than 62 million women's lives.

To help inform global efforts, we modelled potential human papillomavirus (HPV)\nvaccination and cervical screening scenarios in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) to examine the feasibility and timing of elimination at different thresholds, and to estimate the number of cervical cancer\ncases averted on the path to elimination. METHODS: The WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC), which consists of three independent transmission-dynamic models identified by WHO according to predefined criteria,\nprojected reductions in cervical cancer incidence over time in 78 LMICs for three standardised base-case scenarios: girls-only vaccination; girls-only vaccination and once-lifetime screening; and girls-only vaccination and twice-lifetime screening. Girls\nwere vaccinated at age 9 years (with a catch-up to age 14 years), assuming 90% coverage and 100% lifetime protection against HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and\n58. Cervical screening involved HPV testing once or twice per lifetime at ages 35 years and 45 years, with uptake increasing from 45% (2023) to 90% (2045 onwards). The elimination\nthresholds examined were an average age-standardised cervical cancer incidence of four or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years and ten or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, and an 85%\nor greater reduction in incidence. Sensitivity analyses were done, varying vaccination and screening strategies and assumptions. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions. FINDINGS: Girls-only HPV vaccination\nwas predicted to reduce the median age-standardised cervical cancer incidence in LMICs from 19.8 (range 19.4-19.8) to 2.1 (2.0-2.6) cases per 100 000 women-years over the next century (89.4% [86.2-90.1]\nreduction), and to avert 61.0 million (60.5-63.0) cases during this period. Adding twice-lifetime screening reduced the incidence to 0.7 (0.6-1.6) cases per 100 000 women-years (96.7% [91.3-96.7] reduction) and averted\nan extra 12.1 million (9.5-13.7) cases. Girls-only vaccination was predicted to result in elimination in 60% (58-65) of LMICs based on the threshold of four or fewer cases per 100\n000 women-years, in 99% (89-100) of LMICs based on the threshold of ten or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, and in 87% (37-99) of LMICs based on the 85%\nor greater reduction threshold. When adding twice-lifetime screening, 100% (71-100) of LMICs reached elimination for all three thresholds. In regions in which all countries can achieve cervical cancer elimination with\ngirls-only vaccination, elimination could occur between 2059 and 2102, depending on the threshold and region. Introducing twice-lifetime screening accelerated elimination by 11-31 years. Long-term vaccine protection was required for elimination.\nINTERPRETATION: Predictions were consistent across our three models and suggest that high HPV vaccination coverage of girls can lead to cervical cancer elimination in most LMICs by the end of\nthe century. Screening with high uptake will expedite reductions and will be necessary to eliminate cervical cancer in countries with the highest burden.

Oncology", "Creation Date": "2020/02/03 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib reduced the risk of relapse versus placebo in patients with resected, BRAF(V600)-mutant, stage III melanoma in the phase 3 COMBI-AD trial. This prespecified exploratory biomarker\nanalysis aimed to evaluate potential prognostic or predictive factors and mechanisms of resistance to adjuvant targeted therapy. METHODS: COMBI-AD is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial comparing dabrafenib 150\nmg orally twice daily plus trametinib 2 mg orally once daily versus two matched placebos. Study participants were at least 18 years of age and underwent complete resection of stage\nIIIA (lymph node metastases >1 mm), IIIB, or IIIC cutaneous melanoma, per American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition criteria, with a BRAF(V600E) or BRAF(V600K) mutation. Patients were randomly assigned\n(1:1) to the two treatment groups by an interactive voice response system, stratified by mutation type and disease stage. Patients, physicians, and the investigators who analysed data were masked to\ntreatment allocation. The primary outcome was relapse-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to disease recurrence or death from any cause. Biomarker assessment was a prespecified exploratory outcome of\nthe trial. We assessed intrinsic tumour genomic features by use of next-generation DNA sequencing and characteristics of the tumour microenvironment by use of a NanoString RNA assay, which might provide\nprognostic and predictive information. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01682083, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants. FINDINGS: Between Jan 31, 2013, and Dec 11, 2014, 870\npatients were enrolled in the trial. Median follow-up at data cutoff (April 30, 2018) was 44 months (IQR 38-49) in the dabrafenib plus trametinib group and 42 months (21-49) in\nthe placebo group. Intrinsic tumour genomic features were assessed in 368 patients (DNA sequencing set) and tumour microenvironment characteristics were assessed in 507 patients (NanoString biomarker set). MAPK pathway genomic\nalterations at baseline did not affect treatment benefit or clinical outcome. An IFNgamma gene expression signature higher than the median was prognostic for prolonged relapse-free survival in both treatment groups.\nTumour mutational burden was independently prognostic for relapse-free survival in the placebo group (high TMB, top third; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85, p=0.0056), but not in the dabrafenib\nplus trametinib group (0.83, 95% CI 0.53-1.32, p=0.44). Patients with tumour mutational burden in the lower two terciles seem to derive a substantial long-term relapse-free survival benefit from targeted therapy\n(HR [versus placebo] 0.49, 95% CI 0.35-0.68, p<0.0001). However, patients with high tumour mutational burden seem to have a less pronounced benefit with targeted therapy (HR [versus placebo] 0.75, 95%\nCI 0.44-1.26, p=0.27), especially if they had an IFNgamma signature lower than the median (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.40-1.93], p=0.74). INTERPRETATION: Tumour mutational burden alone or in combination with IFNgamma\ngene expression signature or other markers for an adaptive immune response might be of relevance for identifying patients with stage III melanoma who might derive clinical benefit from targeted therapy.\nFurther validation in prospective clinical trials is warranted.

In Europe, according\nto the International Society of Paediatric Oncology guidelines, core needle biopsy is not routinely done unless the child is older than 10 years. Between age 6 months and 9 years,\nthe child is treated with a standard regimen of preoperative chemotherapy unless there are concerns about non-Wilms' tumour pathology. Atypical imaging findings could therefore stratify a child into a different\ntreatment protocol, and can prompt the need for pretreatment histology. This review details the latest protocols and techniques used in the assessment of paediatric renal tumours. Important imaging findings are\ndiscussed, especially the features that might prompt the need for a pretreatment biopsy. Local radiology practices vary, but both MRI and CT are widely used as routine imaging tests for\nthe assessment of paediatric renal tumours in Europe. Advances in imaging technology and MRI sequences are facilitating the development of new techniques, which might increase the utility of imaging in\nterms of predicting tumour histology and clinical behaviour.

Across the three socioeconomic position indicators and after adjustment for lifestyle factors, compared with more advantaged groups, low socioeconomic status was associated with increased risk for 18\n(32.1%) of the 56 conditions. 16 diseases formed a cascade of inter-related health conditions with a hazard ratio greater than 5. This sequence began with psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and\nself-harm, which were associated with later liver and renal diseases, ischaemic heart disease, cerebral infarction, chronic obstructive bronchitis, lung cancer, and dementia. INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight the importance of mental\nhealth and behavioural problems in setting in motion the development of a range of socioeconomically patterned physical illnesses. Policy and health-care practice addressing psychological health issues in social context and\nearly in the life course could be effective strategies for reducing health inequalities.

Some have argued that beta-cell mass in some patients with type 2 diabetes is normal and that the cause\nof the hyperglycaemia in these patients is a functional abnormality of insulin secretion. In this Personal View, we argue that a deficient beta-cell mass is essential for the development of\ntype 2 diabetes. The main point is that there are enormous (>/=10 fold) variations in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in the general population, with a very close correlation between\nthese two factors for any individual. Although beta-cell mass cannot be accurately measured in living patients, it is highly likely that it too is highly correlated with insulin sensitivity and\nsecretion. Thus, our argument is that a person with type 2 diabetes can have a beta-cell mass that is the same as a person without type 2 diabetes, but because\nthey are insulin resistant, the mass is inadequate and responsible for their diabetes. Because the abnormal insulin secretion of diabetes is caused by dysglycaemia and can be largely reversed with\nglycaemic control, it is a less serious problem than the reduction in beta-cell mass, which is far more difficult to restore.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32006519", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32006518", "Title": "Association of glucose-lowering medications with cardiovascular outcomes: an umbrella review and evidence map.", "JournalName": "The lancet.

We examined\nthe association between glucose-lowering medications and a broad range of cardiovascular outcomes, and assessed the strength of evidence for these associations. METHODS: For this umbrella review we searched PubMed, Embase,\nand the Cochrane Library to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials examining the cardiovascular safety of glucose-lowering medications. Cardiovascular outcomes examined included major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular\ndeath, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, unstable angina, and atrial fibrillation. For each meta-analysis, we estimated the relative risk (RR) and 95% CI. We also created an evidence map showing\nthe plausible benefits or harms of each intervention and the certainty of the evidence. FINDINGS: We examined 232 meta-analyses evaluating ten classes of diabetes drugs. We identified six risk and\n38 protective associations showing a high strength of evidence. Six associations increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, including glimepiride (stroke [RR 2.01; 95% CI 1.02-3.98]), rosiglitazone (myocardial infarction [1.28; 1.02-1.62]\nand heart failure [1.72, 1.31-2.27]), and pioglitazone (heart failure [1.40; 1.16-1.69]). 38 associations decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists as a class (major adverse cardiovascular\nevents [RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.84-0.92], death from cardiovascular disease [0.87; 0.81-0.94], myocardial infarction [0.92; 0.86-0.99], stroke [0.84; 0.77-0.93], and heart failure [0.90; 0.83-0.99]), albiglutide (major adverse cardiovascular events [0.81;\n0.68-0.96], myocardial infarction [0.77; 0.64-0.92], and heart failure [0.71; 0.55-0.93]), dulaglutide (stroke [0.78; 0.64-0.96]), exenatide (major adverse cardiovascular events [0.91; 0.83-1.00]), liraglutide (major adverse cardiovascular events [0.86; 0.77-0.96]), semaglutide (major\nadverse cardiovascular events [0.76; 0.62-0.92] and stroke [0.67; 0.45-1.00]), sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors as a class (major adverse cardiovascular events [0.87; 0.82-0.93], death from cardiovascular disease [0.82; 0.75-0.90], myocardial infarction [0.86;\n0.78-0.94], and heart failure [0.68; 0.63-0.73]), canagliflozin (major adverse cardiovascular events [0.84; 0.75-0.93], death from cardiovascular disease [0.82; 0.71-0.96], and heart failure [0.65; 0.54-0.78]), dapagliflozin (heart failure [0.70; 0.60-0.82]), empagliflozin\n(major adverse cardiovascular events [0.85; 0.77-0.94], death from cardiovascular disease [0.62; 0.50-0.78], and heart failure [0.64; 0.53-0.77]), and pioglitazone (major adverse cardiovascular events [0.84; 0.74-0.96], myocardial infarction [0.80; 0.67-0.95], and\nstroke [0.79; 0.65-0.95]).

The majority (17) of zoonoses were bacterial, with nine viruses, three protozoa, and one helminth also identified. Leptospira species and non-typhoidal salmonella serovars were the\nmost frequently reported pathogens. Despite evidence of profound data gaps, this Review reveals widespread distribution of multiple zoonoses that cause febrile illness.

For haematological malignancies, targeted therapies, such as small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies,\nhave a high anti-tumour activity, are well tolerated, and have a low incidence of associated tumour lysis syndrome. The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has a high anti-tumour activity in chronic lymphocytic\nleukaemia, achieving deep remissions by potently inducing apoptosis and increasing the risk for tumour lysis syndrome. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the pathophysiology, risk factors, monitoring, changes in laboratory parameters,\nand clinical manifestations of tumour lysis syndrome, and the prophylaxis and treatments available for this complication. Prophylaxis and treatment strategies have been implemented as standard of care in patients receiving\nvenetoclax to minimise the risk of both laboratory and clinical manifestations of tumour lysis syndrome.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32004486", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32004485", "Title": "Prophylaxis and management of graft versus host disease after stem-cell transplantation for haematological malignancies: updated consensus recommendations of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.", "JournalName": "The Lancet. Haematology", "Creation Date": "2020/02/14 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major factor contributing to mortality and morbidity after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Because of the small number of results from well designed, large-scale, clinical studies there\nis considerable variability in the prevention and treatment of GVHD worldwide. In 2014, to standardise treatment approaches the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation published recommendations on the management\nof GVHD in the setting of HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor transplantation in adult patients with haematological malignancies. Here we update these recommendations including the results of study published after\n2014. Evidence was searched in three steps: first, a widespread scan of published trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews; second, expert opinion was added for specific issues following several rounds of\ndebate; and third, a refined search to target debated or rapidly updating issues. On the basis of this evidence and the 2014 recommendations, five members of the EBMT Transplant Complications\nWorking Party created 38 statements on GVHD prophylaxis, drug management, and treatment of acute and chronic GVHD. Subsequently, they created the EBMT GVHD management recommendation expert panel by recruiting 20\nexperts with expertise in GVHD management. An email-based, two-round Delphi panel approach was used to manage the consensus. Modified National Comprehensive Cancer Network categories for evidence and consensus were applied\nto the approved statements. We reached 100% consensus for 29 recommendations and 95% consensus for nine recommendations. Key updates to these recommendations include a broader use of rabbit anti-T-cell globulin;\nlower steroid doses for the management of grade 2 acute GVHD with isolated skin or upper gastrointestinal tract manifestations; fluticasone, azithromycin, and montelukast should be used for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome;\nand the addition of newer treatment options for resteroid-refractory acute and chronic GVHD. In addition, we discuss specific aspects of GVHD prophylaxis and management in the setting of haploidentical transplantation\nand in paediatric patients, but no formal recommendations on those procedures have been provided in this Review. The European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation proposes to use these recommendations\nas a basis for the routine management of GVHD during stem-cell transplantation.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32004485", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "32004472", "Title": "Correction to Lancet HIV 2019; 6: e105-15.", "JournalName": "The lancet.

Despite this association, little is known about which treatments work best for survivors of developmental trauma\nwith psychosis. We sought to do the first review, to our knowledge, to investigate treatments for people with psychotic and dissociative symptoms who have a history of developmental trauma. We\nsearched MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Google Scholar for studies reporting psychological and pharmacological treatments of psychotic or dissociative symptoms in adult survivors of developmental trauma. We identified 24 studies, most of\nwhich investigated various modalities of psychotherapy with two case reports of pharmacological treatments. There is preliminary evidence in favour of third wave cognitive therapies. However, because of low methodological quality\nand reporting in most of the studies found, it remains unknown which treatments are most effective in this clinical group. Nonetheless, our findings of potential treatment targets, including emotion regulation,\nacceptance, interpersonal skills, trauma re-processing, and the integration of dissociated ego states, could guide future work in this area.

Oncology", "Creation Date": "2020/01/31 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: TAS-102 (trifluridine-tipiracil) has shown a significant overall survival benefit compared with placebo in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Inspired by the encouraging results of a small phase 1-2\nstudy, C-TASK FORCE, which evaluated the combination of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer, we aimed to compare the efficacy of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab versus TAS-102\nmonotherapy in patients receiving refractory therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer . METHODS: This investigator-initiated, open-label, randomised, phase 2 study enrolled patients (aged >/=18 years) with metastatic colorectal from four cancer\ncentres in Denmark. The main inclusion criteria were histopathologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer refractory or intolerant to a fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and cetuximab or panitumumab (only for RAS wild-type), and\nWHO performance status of 0 or 1. Previous therapy with bevacizumab, aflibercept, ramucirumab, or regorafenib was allowed but not mandatory. Participants were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) in block sizes\nof two, four, or six by a web-based tool to receive oral TAS-102 (35 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 every 28 days) alone or combined with intravenous\nbevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15) until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient decision to withdraw. Treatment assignment was not masked, and randomisation was stratified by institution and RAS\nmutation status. The primary endpoint was investigator-evaluated progression-free survival. All analyses were based on intention to treat. This trial is registered with EudraCT, 2016-005241-23. FINDINGS: From Aug 24, 2017, to\nOct 31, 2018, 93 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to TAS-102 (n=47) or TAS-102 plus bevacizumab (n=46). The clinical cut-off date was Feb 15, 2019, after a median follow-up\nof 10.0 months (IQR 6.8-14.0). Median progression-free survival was 2.6 months (95% CI 1.6-3.5) in the TAS-102 group versus 4.6 months (3.5-6.5) in the TAS-102 plus bevacizumab group (hazard ratio\n0.45 [95% CI 0.29-0.72]; p=0.0015). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse event was neutropenia (18 [38%] of 47 in the TAS-102 monotherapy group vs 31 [67%] of 46\nin the TAS-102 plus bevacizumab group). Serious adverse events were observed in 21 (45%) patients in the TAS-102 group and 19 (41%) in the TAS-102 plus bevacizumab group. No deaths\nwere deemed treatment related. INTERPRETATION: In patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer, TAS-102 plus bevacizumab, as compared with TAS-102 monotherapy, was associated with a significant and clinically relevant improvement in\nprogression-free survival with tolerable toxicity. The combination of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab could be a new treatment option for patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer and could be a practice-changing development.\nFUNDING: Servier.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31999946", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31999945", "Title": "TAS-102 plus bevacizumab: a new standard for metastatic colorectal cancer?", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

Neurology", "Creation Date": "2020/01/31 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: beta-adrenoceptors are widely expressed in different human organs, mediate important body functions and are targeted by medications for various diseases (such as coronary heart disease and heart attack) and\nmany beta-adrenoceptor acting drugs are listed on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are used by billions of patients with neurological disorders, primarily for the treatment of\nmigraine and action tremor (mainly essential tremor), worldwide. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: An observational study reported a link between the chronic use of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and an increased risk of\nParkinson's disease, while the chronic use of the beta-adrenoceptor agonists was associated with a decreased risk. Further support of this association was provided by a dose-dependent decrease in the risk\nof Parkinson's disease with chronic beta-adrenoceptor agonist (eg, salbutamol) use, and by functional data indicating a possible underlying molecular mechanism. Five additional epidemiological studies have examined the modulation of the\nrisk of Parkinson's disease as a result of the use of beta-adrenoceptor-acting drugs in different populations. Overall, similar estimates but different interpretations of the associations were provided. Several findings suggest\nthat the increase in risk of Parkinson's disease associated with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists use can be explained by reverse causation because prodromal Parkinson's disease is often associated with non-specific action tremor,\nwhich is usually treated with propranolol. The lower risk of Parkinson's disease seen in patients receiving beta-adrenoceptor agonists is likely to be indirectly mediated by smoking because smoking has a\nstrong inverse association with Parkinson's disease (people that smoke have a reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease). Smoking also causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is treated with beta-adrenoceptor-agonist medications.\nEven if causal, the effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the risk of Parkinson's disease would be small compared with other Parkinson's disease risk factors and would be similar to the\nrisk evoked by pesticide exposure. The estimated risk of Parkinson's disease because of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists use corresponds to one case in 10 000 patients after 5 years of propranolol use,\nand would be considered a very rare adverse effect. Thus, not using beta-adrenoceptor antagonists would severely harm patients with recommended indications, such as heart disease or migraine. Similarly, 50 000\npeople would have to be treated for 5 years with salbutamol to prevent Parkinson's disease in one patient, suggesting that primary preventive therapy studies on disease modification are not warranted.\nWHERE NEXT?: Epidemiological evidence for a causal relationship between use of beta2-adrenoceptor antagonists and the increased risk of Parkinson's disease is weak, with other explanations for the association being more\nprobable. Future observational studies are warranted to clarify this association. However, given the very low risk associated with propranolol, most clinicians are unlikely to change their treatment approach.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31999942", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31999307", "Title": "The Novel Coronavirus Originating in Wuhan, China: Challenges for Global Health Governance.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/01/31 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 30", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31999307", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31999301", "Title": "First-line Psychotherapies for Military-Related PTSD.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/01/31 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 30", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31999301", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31999298", "Title": "The Need to Incorporate Additional Patient Information Into Risk Adjustment for Medicare Beneficiaries.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/01/31 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 30", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31999298", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31996853", "Title": "Cell stress in cortical organoids impairs molecular subtype specification.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/01/31 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "Cortical organoids are self-organizing three-dimensional cultures that model features of the developing human cerebral cortex(1,2).

We identify a genetically determined circuit-extending from the accessory olfactory bulb to the posterior medial amygdala-that is necessary for all behavioural responses to darcin.

Here we sequenced whole genomes of 632 colonies derived from single bronchial epithelial\ncells across 16 subjects. Tobacco smoking was the major influence on mutational burden, typically adding from 1,000 to 10,000 mutations per cell; massively increasing the variance both within and between\nsubjects; and generating several distinct mutational signatures of substitutions and of insertions and deletions. A population of cells in individuals with a history of smoking had mutational burdens that were\nequivalent to those expected for people who had never smoked: these cells had less damage from tobacco-specific mutational processes, were fourfold more frequent in ex-smokers than current smokers and had\nconsiderably longer telomeres than their more-mutated counterparts. Driver mutations increased in frequency with age, affecting 4-14% of cells in middle-aged subjects who had never smoked. In current smokers, at least\n25% of cells carried driver mutations and 0-6% of cells had two or even three drivers.

Here, by following individual ClpB-substrate complexes in real time, we unambiguously demonstrate processive\ntranslocation of looped polypeptides. We integrate optical tweezers with fluorescent-particle tracking to show that ClpB translocates both arms of the loop simultaneously and switches to single-arm translocation when encountering obstacles.\nClpB is notably powerful and rapid; it exerts forces of more than 50 pN at speeds of more than 500 residues per second in bursts of up to 28 residues.\nRemarkably, substrates refold while exiting the pore, analogous to co-translational folding.

In the biogenesis of piRNAs, PIWI\nproteins are first loaded with 5'-monophosphorylated RNA fragments called pre-pre-piRNAs, which then undergo endonucleolytic cleavage to produce pre-piRNAs(1,2). Subsequently, the 3'-ends of pre-piRNAs are trimmed by the exonuclease Trimmer (PNLDC1\nin mouse)(3-6) and 2'-O-methylated by the methyltransferase Hen1 (HENMT1 in mouse)(7-9), generating mature piRNAs. It is assumed that the endonuclease Zucchini (MitoPLD in mouse) is a major enzyme catalysing the\ncleavage of pre-pre-piRNAs into pre-piRNAs(10-13). However, direct evidence for this model is lacking, and how pre-piRNAs are generated remains unclear. Here, to analyse pre-piRNA production, we established a Trimmer-knockout silkworm\ncell line and derived a cell-free system that faithfully recapitulates Zucchini-mediated cleavage of PIWI-loaded pre-pre-piRNAs. We found that pre-piRNAs are generated by parallel Zucchini-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

By contrast, slicing of pre-pre-piRNAs with weak Zucchini motifs is\nachieved by downstream complementary piRNAs, producing pre-piRNAs without 2'-O-methylation.

Nevertheless, engineered PfHT1 mutations made to match GLUT sugar-binding sites did not\nshift sugar preferences. The extracellular substrate-gating helix TM7b in PfHT1 was positioned in a fully occluded conformation, providing a unique glimpse into how sugar binding and gating are coupled. We\ndetermined that polar contacts between TM7b and TM1 (located about 15 A from D-glucose) are just as critical for transport as the residues that directly coordinate D-glucose, which demonstrates a\nstrong allosteric coupling between sugar binding and gating.

Although the last\ninterglaciation (LIG) experienced stronger boreal summer insolation forcing than the present interglaciation(7), understanding why LIG global mean sea level may have been six to nine metres higher than today has\nproven particularly challenging(2). Extensive areas of polar ice sheets were grounded below sea level during both glacial and interglacial periods, with grounding lines and fringing ice shelves extending onto continental\nshelves(8). This suggests that oceanic forcing by subsurface warming may also have contributed to ice-sheet loss(9-12) analogous to ongoing changes in the Antarctic(13,14) and Greenland(15) ice sheets. Such forcing would\nhave been especially effective during glacial periods, when the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) experienced large variations on millennial timescales(16), with a reduction of the AMOC causing subsurface warming throughout\nmuch of the Atlantic basin(9,12,17). Here we show that greater subsurface warming induced by the longer period of reduced AMOC during the penultimate deglaciation can explain the more-rapid sea-level rise\ncompared with the last deglaciation. This greater forcing also contributed to excess loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets during the LIG, causing global mean sea level to rise\nat least four metres above modern levels. When accounting for the combined influences of penultimate and LIG deglaciation on glacial isostatic adjustment, this excess loss of polar ice during the\nLIG can explain much of the relative sea level recorded by fossil coral reefs and speleothems at intermediate- and far-field sites.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31996820", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31996819", "Title": "Synchrotron infrared spectroscopic evidence of the probable transition to metal hydrogen.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/01/31 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan", "Abstract": "Hydrogen has been an essential element in the development of atomic, molecular and condensed matter physics(1). It is predicted that hydrogen should have a metal state(2); however, understanding the properties\nof dense hydrogen has been more complex than originally thought, because under extreme conditions the electrons and protons are strongly coupled to each other and ultimately must both be treated\nas quantum particles(3,4). Therefore, how and when molecular solid hydrogen may transform into a metal is an open question. Although the quest for metal hydrogen has pushed major developments in\nmodern experimental high-pressure physics, the various claims of its observation remain unconfirmed(5-7). Here a discontinuous change of the direct bandgap of hydrogen, from 0.6 electronvolts to below 0.1 electronvolts, is\nobserved near 425 gigapascals. This result is most probably associated with the formation of the metallic state because the nucleus zero-point energy is larger than this lowest bandgap value. Pressures\nabove 400 gigapascals are achieved with the recently developed toroidal diamond anvil cell(8), and the structural changes and electronic properties of dense solid hydrogen at 80 kelvin are probed using\nsynchrotron infrared absorption spectroscopy. The continuous downward shifts of the vibron wavenumber and the direct bandgap with increased pressure point to the stability of phase-III hydrogen up to 425 gigapascals.\nThe present data suggest that metallization of hydrogen proceeds within the molecular solid, in good agreement with previous calculations that capture many-body electronic correlations(9).", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31996819", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31996818", "Title": "Fully hardware-implemented memristor convolutional neural network.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/01/31 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan", "Abstract": "Memristor-enabled neuromorphic computing systems provide a fast and energy-efficient approach to training neural networks(1-4). However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-one of the most important models for image recognition(5)-have not yet been\nfully hardware-implemented using memristor crossbars, which are cross-point arrays with a memristor device at each intersection. Moreover, achieving software-comparable results is highly challenging owing to the poor yield, large variation\nand other non-ideal characteristics of devices(6-9). Here we report the fabrication of high-yield, high-performance and uniform memristor crossbar arrays for the implementation of CNNs, which integrate eight 2,048-cell memristor arrays\nto improve parallel-computing efficiency. In addition, we propose an effective hybrid-training method to adapt to device imperfections and improve the overall system performance. We built a five-layer memristor-based CNN to\nperform MNIST(10) image recognition, and achieved a high accuracy of more than 96 per cent. In addition to parallel convolutions using different kernels with shared inputs, replication of multiple identical\nkernels in memristor arrays was demonstrated for processing different inputs in parallel. The memristor-based CNN neuromorphic system has an energy efficiency more than two orders of magnitude greater than that\nof state-of-the-art graphics-processing units, and is shown to be scalable to larger networks, such as residual neural networks.

DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: National private insurer covering all 50 US states and Washington DC.\nPARTICIPANTS: An annual average of 669 495 providers prescribing 8.9 million opioid prescriptions to 3.9 million patients from 2003 through 2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized doses of opioids in morphine\nmilligram equivalents (MMEs) and number of opioid prescriptions. RESULTS: In 2017, the top 1% of providers accounted for 49% of all opioid doses and 27% of all opioid prescriptions. In\nabsolute terms, the top 1% of providers prescribed an average of 748 000 MMEs-nearly 1000 times more than the middle 1%. At least half of all providers in the top\n1% in one year were also in the top 1% in adjacent years. More than two fifths of all prescriptions written by the top 1% of providers were for more\nthan 50 MMEs a day and over four fifths were for longer than seven days. In contrast, prescriptions written by the bottom 99% of providers were below these thresholds, with\n86% of prescriptions for less than 50 MMEs a day and 71% for fewer than seven days. Providers prescribing high amounts of opioids and patients receiving high amounts of opioids\npersisted over time, with over half of both appearing in adjacent years. CONCLUSIONS: Most prescriptions written by the majority of providers are under the recommended thresholds, suggesting that most US\nproviders are careful in their prescribing. Interventions focusing on this group of providers are unlikely to effect beneficial change and could induce unnecessary burden. A large proportion of providers have\nestablished relationships with their patients over multiple years.

EXPOSURES: Intake of total soy\nproducts, fermented soy products (natto and miso), non-fermented soy products, and tofu from a five year survey questionnaire.

DESIGN: National register based birth cohort study with a sibling\ncomparison design. SETTING: Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 1 680 307 people born in Sweden between 1983 and 2000 to women who smoked (n=377 367, 22.5%) and did not smoke (n=1 302 940)\nin early pregnancy. Follow-up was until 31 December 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Fractures by attained age up to 32 years. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 21.1 years, 377 970\nfractures were observed (the overall incidence rate for fracture standardised by calendar year of birth was 11.8 per 1000 person years). The association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk\nof fracture in offspring differed by attained age. Maternal smoking was associated with a higher rate of fractures in offspring before 1 year of age in the entire cohort (birth\nyear standardised fracture rates in those exposed and unexposed to maternal smoking were 1.59 and 1.28 per 1000 person years, respectively). After adjustment for potential confounders the hazard ratio for\nmaternal smoking compared with no smoking was 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.45). This association followed a dose dependent pattern (compared with no smoking, hazard ratios for 1-9 cigarettes/day\nand >/=10 cigarettes/day were 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.39) and 1.41 (1.18 to 1.69), respectively) and persisted in within-sibship comparisons although with wider confidence intervals (compared with no\nsmoking, 1.58 (1.01 to 2.46)). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was also associated with an increased fracture incidence in offspring from age 5 to 32 years in whole cohort analyses, but\nthese associations did not follow a dose dependent gradient. In within-sibship analyses, which controls for confounding by measured and unmeasured shared familial factors, corresponding point estimates were all close to\nnull. Maternal smoking was not associated with risk of fracture in offspring between the ages of 1 and 5 years in any of the models.

different individuals. This variability results from dynamic interactions between biological\nand non-biological risk factors, which result in increasing differentiation between individuals over time. Although this differentiation continues well into adulthood, the infancy period is when the brain and behavior develop\nrapidly, and when the first signs and symptoms of autism emerge. This review discusses advances in our understanding of the causal pathways leading to autism and overlapping neurodevelopmental conditions. Research\nis also mapping trajectories of brain and behavioral development for some risk groups, namely later born siblings of children with autism and/or infants referred because of developmental concerns. This knowledge\nhas been useful in improving early identification and establishing the feasibility of targeted interventions for infant risk groups before symptoms arise. However, key knowledge gaps remain, such as the discovery\nof protective factors (biological or environmental) that may mitigate the impact of risk. Also, the dynamic mechanisms that underlie the associations between risk factors and outcomes need further research. These\ninclude the processes of resilience, which may explain why some individuals at risk for autism achieve better than expected outcomes. Bridging these knowledge gaps would help to provide tools for\nearly identification and intervention that reflect dynamic developmental pathways from risk to outcomes.", "Link":

28", "Abstract": "Importance: The tort liability system is intended to serve 3 functions: compensate patients who sustain injury from negligence, provide corrective justice, and deter negligence. Deterrence, in theory, occurs because clinicians\nknow that they may experience adverse consequences if they negligently injure patients. Objective: To review empirical findings regarding the association between malpractice liability risk (ie, the extent to which clinicians\nface the threat of being sued and having to pay damages) and health care quality and safety. Data Sources and Study Selection: Systematic search of multiple databases for studies published\nbetween January 1, 1990, and November 25, 2019, examining the relationship between malpractice liability risk measures and health outcomes or structural and process indicators of health care quality. Data Extraction\nand Synthesis: Information on the exposure and outcome measures, results, and acknowledged limitations was extracted by 2 reviewers. Meta-analytic pooling was not possible due to variations in study designs; therefore,\nstudies were summarized descriptively and assessed qualitatively. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations between malpractice risk measures and health care quality and safety outcomes. Exposure measures included physicians' malpractice insurance premiums,\nstate tort reforms, frequency of paid claims, average claim payment, physicians' claims history, total malpractice payments, jury awards, the presence of an immunity from malpractice liability, the Centers for Medicare\n& Medicaid Services' Medicare malpractice geographic practice cost index, and composite measures combining these measures. Outcome measures included patient mortality; hospital readmissions, avoidable admissions, and prolonged length of stay; receipt\nof cancer screening; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality patient safety indicators and other measures of adverse events; measures of hospital and nursing home quality; and patient satisfaction. Results: Thirty-seven\nstudies were included; 28 examined hospital care only and 16 focused on obstetrical care. Among obstetrical care studies, 9 found no significant association between liability risk and outcomes (such as\nApgar score and birth injuries) and 7 found limited evidence for an association. Among 20 studies of patient mortality in nonobstetrical care settings, 15 found no evidence of an association\nwith liability risk and 5 found limited evidence. Among 7 studies that examined hospital readmissions and avoidable initial hospitalizations, none found evidence of an association between liability risk and outcomes.\nAmong 12 studies of other measures (eg, patient safety indicators, process-of-care quality measures, patient satisfaction), 7 found no association between liability risk and these outcomes and 5 identified significant associations\nin some analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review, most studies found no association between measures of malpractice liability risk and health care quality and outcomes. Although gaps in\nthe evidence remain, the available findings suggested that greater tort liability, at least in its current form, was not associated with improved quality of care.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31990319", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31990318", "Title": "A Call for Help-Reflections on Burnout, CABG Surgery, and the Super Bowl.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 28", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31990318", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31990317", "Title": "Nothing New Under the Sun.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/01/29 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 28", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31990317", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31990316", "Title": "Ketogenic Diets.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 28", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31990316", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31990315", "Title": "Yield of a Public Health Screening of Children for Islet Autoantibodies in Bavaria, Germany.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 28", "Abstract": "Importance: Public health screening for type 1 diabetes in its presymptomatic stages may reduce disease severity and burden on a population level. Objective: To determine the prevalence of presymptomatic type\n1 diabetes in children participating in a public health screening program for islet autoantibodies and the risk for progression to clinical diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Screening for islet autoantibodies\nwas offered to children aged 1.75 to 5.99 years in Bavaria, Germany, between 2015 and 2019 by primary care pediatricians during well-baby visits. Families of children with multiple islet autoantibodies\n(presymptomatic type 1 diabetes) were invited to participate in a program of diabetes education, metabolic staging, assessment of psychological stress associated with diagnosis, and prospective follow-up for progression to clinical\ndiabetes until July 31, 2019. Exposures: Measurement of islet autoantibodies. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was presymptomatic type 1 diabetes, defined by 2 or more islet autoantibodies, with\ncategorization into stages 1 (normoglycemia), 2 (dysglycemia), or 3 (clinical) type 1 diabetes. Secondary outcomes were the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis and parental psychological stress, assessed by the Patient Health\nQuestionnaire-9 (range, 0-27; higher scores indicate worse depression; </=4 indicates no to minimal depression; >20 indicates severe depression). Results: Of 90632 children screened (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 3.1 [2.1-4.2]\nyears; 48.5% girls), 280 (0.31%; 95% CI, 0.27-0.35) had presymptomatic type 1 diabetes, including 196 (0.22%) with stage 1, 17 (0.02%) with stage 2, 26 (0.03%) with stage 3, and\n41 who were not staged. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 2.4 (1.0-3.2) years, another 36 children developed stage 3 type 1 diabetes. The 3-year cumulative risk for stage 3\ntype 1 diabetes in the 280 children with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes was 24.9% ([95% CI, 18.5%-30.7%]; 54 cases; annualized rate, 9.0%). Two children had diabetic ketoacidosis. Median (IQR) psychological\nstress scores were significantly increased at the time of metabolic staging in mothers of children with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes (3 [1-7]) compared with mothers of children without islet autoantibodies\n(2 [1-4]) (P = .002), but declined after 12 months of follow-up (2 [0-4]) (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children aged 2 to 5 years in Bavaria, Germany,\na program of primary care-based screening showed an islet autoantibody prevalence of 0.31%.

The new diastolic BP threshold of 80 mm Hg was recommended based on expert opinion and changes the definition of\nisolated diastolic hypertension (IDH). Objective: To compare the prevalence of IDH in the United States, by 2017 ACC/AHA and 2003 Joint National Committee (JNC7) definitions, and to characterize cross-sectional and\nlongitudinal associations of IDH with outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2013-2016) and longitudinal analyses of the Atherosclerosis Risk in\nCommunities (ARIC) Study (baseline 1990-1992, with follow-up through December 31, 2017). Longitudinal results were validated in 2 external cohorts: (1) the NHANES III (1988-1994) and NHANES 1999-2014 and (2) the\nGive Us a Clue to Cancer and Heart Disease (CLUE) II cohort (baseline 1989). Exposures: IDH, by 2017 ACC/AHA (systolic BP <130 mm Hg, diastolic BP >/=80 mm Hg) and\nby JNC7 (systolic BP <140 mm Hg, diastolic BP >/=90 mm Hg) definitions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Weighted estimates for prevalence of IDH in US adults and prevalence of US\nadults recommended BP pharmacotherapy by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline based solely on the presence of IDH. Risk of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease\n(CKD) in the ARIC Study. Results: The study population included 9590 adults from the NHANES (mean [SD] baseline age, 49.6 [17.6] years; 5016 women [52.3%]) and 8703 adults from the\nARIC Study (mean [SD] baseline age, 56.0 [5.6] years; 4977 women [57.2%]). The estimated prevalence of IDH in the NHANES was 6.5% by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and 1.3% by\nthe JNC7 definition (absolute difference, 5.2% [95% CI, 4.7%-5.7%]). Among those newly classified as having IDH, an estimated 0.6% (95% CI, 0.5%-0.6%) also met the guideline threshold for antihypertensive therapy.\nCompared with normotensive ARIC participants, IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition was not significantly associated with incident ASCVD (n = 1386 events; median follow-up, 25.2 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.06\n[95% CI, 0.89-1.26]), HF (n = 1396 events; HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.76-1.09]), or CKD (n = 2433 events; HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.65-1.11]). Results were also null for cardiovascular\nmortality in the 2 external cohorts (eg, HRs of IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition were 1.17 [95% CI, 0.87-1.56] in the NHANES [n = 1012 events] and 1.02 [95%\nCI, 0.92-1.14] in CLUE II [n = 1497 events]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of US adults, the estimated prevalence of IDH was more common when defined by the\n2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline compared with the JNC7 guideline.

produced by a top-down approach, exfoliating graphite, which often requires large amounts of solvent with high-energy mixing, shearing, sonication or electrochemical treatment(1-3). Although chemical oxidation of\ngraphite to graphene oxide promotes exfoliation, it requires harsh oxidants and leaves the graphene with a defective perforated structure after the subsequent reduction step(3,4). Bottom-up synthesis of high-quality graphene is\noften restricted to ultrasmall amounts if performed by chemical vapour deposition or advanced synthetic organic methods, or it provides a defect-ridden structure if carried out in bulk solution(4-6). Here we\nshow that flash Joule heating of inexpensive carbon sources-such as coal, petroleum coke, biochar, carbon black, discarded food, rubber tyres and mixed plastic waste-can afford gram-scale quantities of graphene in\nless than one second. The product, named flash graphene (FG) after the process used to produce it, shows turbostratic arrangement (that is, little order) between the stacked graphene layers. FG\nsynthesis uses no furnace and no solvents or reactive gases. Yields depend on the carbon content of the source; when using a high-carbon source, such as carbon black, anthracitic coal\nor calcined coke, yields can range from 80 to 90 per cent with carbon purity greater than 99 per cent. No purification steps are necessary. Raman spectroscopy analysis shows a\nlow-intensity or absent D band for FG, indicating that FG has among the lowest defect concentrations reported so far for graphene, and confirms the turbostratic stacking of FG, which is\nclearly distinguished from turbostratic graphite. The disordered orientation of FG layers facilitates its rapid exfoliation upon mixing during composite formation. The electric energy cost for FG synthesis is only about\n7.2 kilojoules per gram, which could render FG suitable for use in bulk composites of plastic, metals, plywood, concrete and other building materials.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988511", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31988510", "Title": "Spin current from sub-terahertz-generated antiferromagnetic magnons.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/01/29 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb", "Abstract": "Spin dynamics in antiferromagnets has much shorter timescales than in ferromagnets, offering attractive properties for potential applications in ultrafast devices(1-3). However, spin-current generation via antiferromagnetic resonance and simultaneous electrical detection\nby the inverse spin Hall effect in heavy metals have not yet been explicitly demonstrated(4-6). Here we report sub-terahertz spin pumping in heterostructures of a uniaxial antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 crystal and\na heavy metal (Pt or Ta in its beta phase). At 0.240 terahertz, the antiferromagnetic resonance in Cr2O3 occurs at about 2.7 tesla, which excites only right-handed magnons. In the\nspin-canting state, another resonance occurs at 10.5 tesla from the precession of induced magnetic moments. Both resonances generate pure spin currents in the heterostructures, which are detected by the heavy\nmetal as peaks or dips in the open-circuit voltage. The pure-spin-current nature of the electrically detected signals is unambiguously confirmed by the reversal of the voltage polarity observed under two\nconditions: when switching the detector metal from Pt to Ta, reversing the sign of the spin Hall angle(7-9), and when flipping the magnetic-field direction, reversing the magnon chirality(4,5). The temperature\ndependence of the electrical signals at both resonances suggests that the spin current contains both coherent and incoherent magnon contributions, which is further confirmed by measurements of the spin Seebeck\neffect and is well described by a phenomenological theory. These findings reveal the unique characteristics of magnon excitations in antiferromagnets and their distinctive roles in spin-charge conversion in the high-frequency\nregime.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988510", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31988406", "Title": "Techniques converge to map the developing human heart at single-cell level.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988406", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31988405", "Title": "Remember what science owes to child refugees.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988405", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31988404", "Title": "Alone where seals bark in the mist.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/01/29 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988404", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31988403", "Title": "Suspect that modulates the heartbeat is ensnared.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988403", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31988402", "Title": "How the stress of fight or flight turns hair white.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/01/29 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988402", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31988401", "Title": "A watershed moment for protein structure prediction.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988401", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31986524", "Title": "A Disclosure Form for Work Submitted to Medical Journals: A Proposal From the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/01/28 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 27", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986524", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31986263", "Title": "Cultivating awareness of the Holocaust in medicine.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/06 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 1", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986263", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31986262", "Title": "Cultivating awareness of the Holocaust in medicine.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/01/28 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 1", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986262", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31986260", "Title": "Cultivating awareness of the Holocaust in medicine.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/01/28 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 1", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986260", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31986256", "Title": "Interpretation of risk loci from genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease.", "JournalName": "The Lancet. Neurology", "Creation Date": "2020/01/28 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Apr", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating and highly heritable neurological condition. As such, genetic studies have sought to understand the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease since the 1990s, with successively\nlarger genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses. These studies started with a small sample size of 1086 individuals in 2007, which was able to identify only the APOE locus. In\n2013, the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) did a meta-analysis of all existing GWAS using data from 74 046 individuals, which stood as the largest Alzheimer's disease GWAS until\n2018. This meta-analysis discovered 19 susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease in populations of European ancestry. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: Three new Alzheimer's disease GWAS published in 2018 and 2019, which used larger\nsample sizes and proxy phenotypes from biobanks, have substantially increased the number of known susceptibility loci in Alzheimer's disease to 40. The first, an updated GWAS from IGAP, included 94\n437 individuals and discovered 24 susceptibility loci. Although IGAP sought to increase sample size by recruiting additional clinical cases and controls, the two other studies used parental family history of\nAlzheimer's disease to define proxy cases and controls in the UK Biobank for a genome-wide association by proxy, which was meta-analysed with data from GWAS of clinical Alzheimer's disease to\nattain sample sizes of 388 324 and 534 403 individuals. These two studies identified 27 and 29 susceptibility loci, respectively. However, the three studies were not independent because of the\nlarge overlap in their participants, and interpretation can be challenging because different variants and genes were highlighted by each study, even in the same locus. Furthermore, neither the variant with\nthe strongest Alzheimer's disease association nor the nearest gene are necessarily causal. This situation presents difficulties for experimental studies, drug development, and other future research. WHERE NEXT?: The ultimate goal\nof understanding the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease is to characterise novel biological pathways that underly Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and to identify novel drug targets. GWAS have successfully contributed to\nthe characterisation of the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease, with the identification of 40 susceptibility loci; however, this does not equate to the discovery of 40 Alzheimer's disease genes. To\nidentify Alzheimer's disease genes, these loci need to be mapped to variants and genes through functional genomics studies that combine annotation of variants, gene expression, and gene-based or pathway-based analyses.\nSuch studies are ongoing and have validated several genes at Alzheimer's disease loci, but greater sample sizes and cell-type specific data are needed to map all GWAS loci.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986256", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31986255", "Title": "Correction to Lancet Glob Health 2019; 7: e1644-74.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

CSCR is a common visually disabling condition that develops in individuals up to 60 years of age,\nand there is no definitive treatment. Previous research suggests the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, eplerenone, is effective for treating CSCR; however, this drug is not licensed for the treatment of patients\nwith CSCR. We aimed to evaluate whether eplerenone was superior to placebo in terms of improving visual acuity in patients with chronic CSCR. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre placebo-controlled\ntrial was done at 22 hospitals in the UK. Participants were eligible if they were aged 18-60 years and had had treatment-naive CSCR for 4 months or more. Patients were\nrandomly assigned (1:1) to either the eplerenone or the placebo group by a trial statistician through a password-protected system online. Allocation was stratified by best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and hospital.\nPatients were given either oral eplerenone (25 mg/day for 1 week, increasing to 50 mg/day for up to 12 months) plus usual care or placebo plus usual care for up\nto 12 months. All participants, care teams, outcome assessors, pharmacists, and members of the trial management group were masked to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was BCVA, measured as\nletters read, at 12 months. All outcomes apart from safety were analysed on a modified intention-to-treat basis (participants who withdrew consent without contributing a post-randomisation BCVA measurement were excluded from\nthe primary analysis population and from most secondary analysis populations). The trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN92746680, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2017, and Feb 22, 2018, we\nenrolled and randomly assigned 114 patients to receive either eplerenone (n=57) or placebo (n=57). Three participants in the placebo group withdrew consent without contributing a post-randomisation BCVA measurement and were\nexcluded from the primary outcome analysis population. All patients from the eplerenone group and 54 patients from the placebo group were included in the primary outcome. Modelled mean BCVA at\n12 months was 79.5 letters (SD 4.5) in the placebo group and 80.4 letters (4.6) in the eplerenone group, with an adjusted estimated mean difference of 1.73 letters (95% CI\n-1.12 to 4.57; p=0.24) at 12 months. Hyperkalaemia occurred in eight (14%) patients in each group. No serious adverse events were reported in the eplerenone group and three unrelated serious\nadverse events were reported in the placebo group (myocardial infarction [anticipated], diverticulitis [unanticipated], and metabolic surgery [unanticipated]). INTERPRETATION: Eplerenone was not superior to placebo for improving BCVA in people with\nchronic CSCR after 12 months of treatment. Ophthalmologists who currently prescribe eplerenone for CSCR should discontinue this practice.

Meta-analyses of low-dose aspirin to prevent pre-eclampsia suggest that the\nincidence of preterm birth might also be decreased, particularly if initiated before 16 weeks of gestation. METHODS: ASPIRIN was a randomised, multicountry, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin (81 mg\ndaily) initiated between 6 weeks and 0 days of pregnancy, and 13 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy, in nulliparous women with an ultrasound confirming gestational age and a singleton\nviable pregnancy. Participants were enrolled at seven community sites in six countries (two sites in India and one site each in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan,\nand Zambia). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by site) to receive aspirin or placebo tablets of identical appearance, via a sequence generated centrally by the data coordinating centre at\nResearch Triangle Institute International (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). Treatment was masked to research staff, health providers, and patients, and continued until 36 weeks and 7 days of gestation or\ndelivery. The primary outcome of incidence of preterm birth, defined as the number of deliveries before 37 weeks' gestational age, was analysed in randomly assigned women with pregnancy outcomes at\nor after 20 weeks, according to a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) protocol. Analyses of our binary primary outcome involved a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by site, and generalised linear models to obtain\nrelative risk (RR) estimates and associated confidence intervals. Serious adverse events were assessed in all women who received at least one dose of drug or placebo. This study is registered\nwith ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02409680, and the Clinical Trial Registry-India, CTRI/2016/05/006970. FINDINGS: From March 23, 2016 to June 30, 2018, 14 361 women were screened for inclusion and 11 976 women aged\n14-40 years were randomly assigned to receive low-dose aspirin (5990 women) or placebo (5986 women). 5780 women in the aspirin group and 5764 in the placebo group were evaluable for\nthe primary outcome. Preterm birth before 37 weeks occurred in 668 (11.6%) of the women who took aspirin and 754 (13.1%) of those who took placebo (RR 0.89 [95% CI\n0.81 to 0.98], p=0.012). In women taking aspirin, we also observed significant reductions in perinatal mortality (0.86 [0.73-1.00], p=0.048), fetal loss (infant death after 16 weeks' gestation and before 7\ndays post partum; 0.86 [0.74-1.00], p=0.039), early preterm delivery (<34 weeks; 0.75 [0.61-0.93], p=0.039), and the incidence of women who delivered before 34 weeks with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (0.38\n[0.17-0.85], p=0.015). Other adverse maternal and neonatal events were similar between the two groups. INTERPRETATION: In populations of nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies from low-income and middle-income countries, low-dose aspirin\ninitiated between 6 weeks and 0 days of gestation and 13 weeks and 6 days of gestation resulted in a reduced incidence of preterm delivery before 37 weeks, and reduced\nperinatal mortality.

Most previous studies that identified genetic risks for ARDS focused on candidates with biological relevance.\nWe aimed to identify novel genetic variants associated with ARDS susceptibility and to provide complementary functional evidence of their effect in gene regulation. METHODS: We did a case-control genome-wide association\nstudy (GWAS) of 1935 European individuals, using patients with sepsis-associated ARDS as cases and patients with sepsis without ARDS as controls. The discovery stage included 672 patients admitted into a\nnetwork of Spanish intensive care units between January, 2002, and January, 2017. The replication stage comprised 1345 individuals from two independent datasets from the MESSI cohort study (Sep 22, 2008-Nov\n30, 2017; USA) and the VISEP (April 1, 2003-June 30, 2005) and MAXSEP (Oct 1, 2007-March 31, 2010) trials of the SepNet study (Germany). Results from discovery and replication stages\nwere meta-analysed to identify association signals. We then used RNA sequencing data from lung biopsies, in-silico analyses, and luciferase reporter assays to assess the functionallity of associated variants. FINDINGS: We\nidentified a novel genome-wide significant association with sepsis-associated ARDS susceptibility (rs9508032, odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.91, p=5.18 x 10(-8)) located within the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) gene,\nwhich encodes vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1). The region containing the sentinel variant and its best proxies acted as a silencer for the FLT1 promoter, and alleles with\nprotective effects in ARDS further reduced promoter activity (p=0.0047). A literature mining of all previously described ARDS genes validated the association of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA; OR 0.55,\n95% CI 0.41-0.73; p=4.69 x 10(-5)). INTERPRETATION: A common variant within the FLT1 gene is associated with sepsis-associated ARDS. Our findings support a role for the vascular endothelial growth factor\nsignalling pathway in ARDS pathogenesis and identify VEGFR-1 as a potential therapeutic target.

Haematology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/12 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycythaemia vera is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterised by excessive proliferation of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic components in the bone marrow due to mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)\ngene. Ruxolitinib, a JAK 1 and JAK 2 inhibitor, showed superiority over best available therapy in a phase 2 study in patients with polycythaemia vera who were resistant to or\nintolerant of hydroxyurea. We aimed to compare the long-term safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib with best available therapy in patients with polycythaemia vera who were resistant to or intolerant of\nhydroxyurea. METHODS: We report the 5-year results for a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (RESPONSE) that enrolled patients at 109 sites across North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific\nregion. Patients (18 years or older) with polycythaemia vera who were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either ruxolitinib or best available therapy. Patients\nrandomly assigned to the ruxolitinib group received the drug orally at a starting dose of 10 mg twice a day. Single-agent best available therapy comprised hydroxyurea, interferon or pegylated interferon,\npipobroman, anagrelide, approved immunomodulators, or observation without pharmacological treatment. The primary endpoint, composite response (patients who achieved both haematocrit control without phlebotomy and 35% or more reduction from baseline in\nspleen volume) at 32 weeeks was previously reported. Patients receiving best available therapy could cross over to ruxolitinib after week 32. We assessed the durability of primary composite response, complete\nhaematological remission, overall clinicohaematological response, overall survival, patient-reported outcomes, and safety after 5-years of follow-up. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01243944. FINDINGS: We enrolled patients between Oct 27, 2010,\nand Feb 13, 2013, and the study concluded on Feb 9, 2018. Of 342 individuals screened for eligibility, 222 patients were randomly assigned to receive ruxolitinib (n=110, 50%) or best\navailable therapy (n=112, 50%). The median time since polycythaemia vera diagnosis was 8.2 years (IQR 3.9-12.3) in the ruxolitinib group and 9.3 years (4.9-13.8) in the best available therapy group.\n98 (88%) of 112 patients initially randomly assigned to best available therapy crossed over to receive ruxolitinib and no patient remained on best available therapy after 80 weeks of study.\nAmong 25 primary responders in the ruxolitinib group, six had progressed at the time of final analysis. At 5 years, the probability of maintaining primary composite response was 74% (95%\nCI 51-88). The probability of maintaining complete haematological remission was 55% (95% CI 32-73) and the probability of maintaining overall clinicohaematological responses was 67% (54-77). In the intention-to-treat analysis not\naccounting for crossover, the probability of survival at 5 years was 91.9% (84.4-95.9) with ruxolitinib therapy and 91.0% (82.8-95.4) with best available therapy. Anaemia was the most common adverse event\nin patients receiving ruxolitinib (rates per 100 patient-years of exposure were 8.9 for ruxolitinib and 8.8 for the crossover population), though most anaemia events were mild to moderate in severity\n(grade 1 or 2 anaemia rates per 100 patient-years of exposure were 8.0 for ruxolitinib and 8.2 for the crossover population). Non-haematological adverse events were generally lower with long-term ruxolitinib\ntreatment than with best available therapy. Thromboembolic events were lower in the ruxolitinib group than the best available therapy group. There were two on-treatment deaths in the ruxolitinib group. One\nof these deaths was due to gastric adenocarcinoma, which was assessed by the investigator as related to ruxolitinib treatment. INTERPRETATION: We showed that ruxolitinib is a safe and effective long-term\ntreatment option for patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. Taken together, ruxolitinib treatment offers the first widely approved therapeutic alternative for this post-hydroxyurea patient\npopulation.

The clinical presentation and course of the disorder have been extensively characterised. Efficacious medication-based treatments are available and widely used, often alongside complementary psychosocial approaches. However, their\neffectiveness has been questioned because they might not address the broader clinical needs of many individuals with ADHD, especially over the longer term. Non-pharmacological approaches to treatment have proven less\neffective than previously thought, whereas scientific and clinical studies are starting to fundamentally challenge current conceptions of the causes of ADHD in ways that might have the potential to alter\nclinical approaches in the future. In view of this, we first provide an account of the diagnosis, epidemiology, and treatment of ADHD from the perspective of both the fifth edition\nof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Second, we review the progress in our understanding of the causes\nand pathophysiology of ADHD on the basis of science over the past decade or so. Finally, using these discoveries, we explore some of the key challenges to both the current\nmodels and the treatment of ADHD, and the ways in which these findings can promote new perspectives.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31982036", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31982035", "Title": "Department of Error.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/01/27 06:01", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 1", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31982035", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31982034", "Title": "Running thin: implications of a heparin shortage.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/03/14 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Feb 15", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31982034", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31982033", "Title": "Dasatinib versus imatinib for childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

We aimed to test our hypothesis that\nexposure to intimate partner violence would reduce intervention effectiveness for CMDs in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web\nof Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Cochrane, PubMed databases, trials registries, 3ie, Google Scholar, and forward and backward citations for studies published between database inception and Aug 16, 2019. All\nrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for CMDs in LMICs which measured intimate partner violence were included, without language or date restrictions. We approached study authors to obtain unpublished\naggregate subgroup data for women who did and did not report intimate partner violence. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychological distress outcomes.\nEvidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as differences between standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, comparing women who did and who did not report intimate partner violence\nvia random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42017078611. FINDINGS: Of 8122 records identified,\n21 were eligible and data were available for 15 RCTs, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. Anxiety (five interventions, 728 participants) showed a greater\nresponse to intervention among women reporting intimate partner violence than among those who did not (difference in standardised mean differences [dSMD] 0.31, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57, I(2)=49.4%). No differences\nin response to intervention were seen in women reporting intimate partner violence for PTSD (eight interventions, n=1436; dSMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.33, I(2)=42.6%), depression (12 interventions, n=2940; 0.10,\n-0.04 to 0.25, I(2)=49.3%), and psychological distress (four interventions, n=1591; 0.07, -0.05 to 0.18, I(2)=0.0%, p=0.681). INTERPRETATION: Psychological interventions treat anxiety effectively in women with current or recent intimate partner\nviolence exposure in LMICs when delivered by appropriately trained and supervised health-care staff, even when not tailored for this population or targeting intimate partner violence directly. Future research should investigate\nwhether adapting evidence-based psychological interventions for CMDs to address intimate partner violence enhances their acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness in LMICs.

Haematology", "Creation Date": "2020/03/12 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A previous dasatinib discontinuation (DADI) trial showed that 31 (49%) of 63 patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia who were treated with second-line or subsequent dasatinib could discontinue the\ndrug safely. However, the safety and efficacy of discontinuing first-line dasatinib remains unclear. In this trial (the first-line DADI trial) we aimed to assess molecular relapse-free survival at 6 months\nafter discontinuation of dasatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who had been treated with first-line dasatinib and had maintained deep molecular response for at least 1 year. METHODS: The\nfirst-line DADI trial was a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial done at 23 hospitals in Japan. Patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia without hepatosplenomegaly and extramedullary mass, who\nreceived at least 24-month dasatinib treatment and had a sustained deep molecular response (defined as BCR-ABL1/ABL1 international scale </=0.0069% in at least four successive samples spanning a 12 month period)\nwere enrolled. Other eligibility criteria were an age of 15 years or older, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-2, and no primary organ dysfunction. The primary\noutcome was molecular relapse-free survival (also known as treatment-free remission) after discontinuation of dasatinib at 6 months and was analysed in all patients who completed the 12-month consolidation phase. Safety\nwas assessed in all patients who received treatment. This study closed early due to accrual and is registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000011099). FINDINGS: Between Sept 20, 2013\nand July 12, 2016, 68 patients who had a deep molecular response after receiving first-line dasatinib for at least 24 months were enrolled and assigned to the consolidation phase. Nine\npatients were excluded during the consolidation phase and one patient was excluded after study completion because of meeting exclusion criteria. 58 patients discontinued dasatinib and were assessed. 32 (55%) of\n58 patients had treatment-free remission at 6 months after dasatinib discontinuation, and median follow-up was 23.3 months (IQR 11.7-31.0). Treatment-free remission at 6 months was 55.2% (95% CI 43.7-69.6). No\nnon-haematological adverse events worse than grade 2 occurred before dasatinib discontinuation. The most common haematological adverse event was anaemia (14 [21%] of 68 treated patients); three (4%) of 68 treated\npatients had grade 3 neutropenia and one (1%) had grade 4 lymphopenia. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that dasatinib could be safely discontinued after first-line treatment in patients with chronic myeloid\nleukaemia who had received at least 36 months of therapy and sustained deep molecular response; however, further confirmation in larger trials is needed.

However, variation in the risk of self-harm by specific psychiatric disorder and stratified by gender and age is rarely examined in\npopulation-representative samples. This study aimed to investigate the risk of self-harm following diagnosis of different psychiatric disorders in an Asian population, through a review of inpatient records retrieved from the\nHong Kong Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS). METHODS: For this nested case-control study, the inpatient data of people admitted for any reason to Hong Kong public hospitals, between\nJan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2010, were extracted from CDARS. Cases were people aged 10 years or older who had been admitted to inpatient care with a first-listed record\nof psychiatric disorder during the study period. The seven psychiatric disorders of interest were: depression, alcohol misuse or dependence, personality disorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and substance misuse or\ndependence. Two control patients were matched per case from a subsample of all individuals with the same gender, age, and admission time (ie, same calendar year and month), who did\nnot have any record of the psychiatric disorders of interest. Any patients with a history of self-harm diagnosis before, or at the same time as, the first diagnosis of psychiatric\ndisorder (cases) or admission (controls), were excluded. For each diagnostic category, a Cox proportional hazard regression model was fitted to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR; plus 95% CIs) of\nassociated self-harm, adjusting for gender, age, control-matched admission time, 20 districts of residence, physical comorbidities established as risk factors for self-harm (diabetes, asthma, migraine, epilepsy, HIV, and cancer), and presence\nof the six other psychiatric disorders. We repeated this analysis in subgroups stratified by gender (male and female) and by age (adolescent, 10-24 years; young adult, 25-44 years; middle-aged, 45-64\nyears; and older people, >/=65 years). FINDINGS: Between 2000 and 2010, we followed up a cohort of 86 353 people with a first-recorded diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder of interest,\nand 134 857 matched controls. The highest risk of self-harm was observed in patients with substance misuse or dependence (adjusted HR vs matched controls, 9.6 [95% CI 8.4-11.0]), followed by\nthose with personality disorders (3.7 [2.8-4.9]) and alcohol misuse or dependence (3.2 [2.9-3.7]). When stratified by gender and age, the highest risk of self-harm behaviour was found in the substance\nmisuse or dependence group for both genders (for female patients: adjusted HR vs matched controls, 7.7 [6.0-9.8]; and for male patients, 10.5 [8.9-12.4]), and for all age groups (adolescent: 9.6\n[7.2-12.7]; young adults: 10.2 [8.4-12.3]; middle-aged: 11.2 [8.0-15.6], and older people: 3.2 [1.7-6.1]). INTERPRETATION: First-recorded diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were significantly associated with an elevated risk of subsequent self-harm. The\nassociations varied considerably by diagnostic categories across gender and age subgroups. Our findings highlight the need to develop more efficient and targeted preventive measures in psychiatric care management, with specific\nattention to demographic characteristics linked to increased risk within the same diagnostic category.

DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Ovid Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar from\ninception to January 2018; reference lists of eligible studies and experts in the field. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Observational studies including cross sectional, cohort, case-control, interrupted time series, and\nbefore-after studies of patient groups reporting at least one of the following outcomes: prevalence of industry funding; proportion of industry funded patient groups that disclosed information about this funding; and\nassociation between industry funding and organisational positions on health and policy issues. Studies were included irrespective of language or publication type. REVIEW METHODS: Reviewers carried out duplicate independent data extraction\nand assessment of study quality. An amended version of the checklist for prevalence studies developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute was used to assess study quality. A DerSimonian-Laird estimate of\nsingle proportions with Freeman-Tukey arcsine transformation was used for meta-analyses of prevalence. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was used to assess the quality of the evidence for\neach outcome. RESULTS: 26 cross sectional studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 15 studies estimated the prevalence of industry funding, which ranged from 20% (12/61) to 83% (86/104). Among\npatient organisations that received industry funding, 27% (175/642; 95% confidence interval 24% to 31%) disclosed this information on their websites. In submissions to consultations, two studies showed very different disclosure\nrates (0% and 91%), which appeared to reflect differences in the relevant government agency's disclosure requirements. Prevalence estimates of organisational policies that govern corporate sponsorship ranged from 2% (2/125) to\n64% (175/274). Four studies analysed the relationship between industry funding and organisational positions on a range of highly controversial issues. Industry funded groups generally supported sponsors' interests. CONCLUSION: In general,\nindustry funding of patient groups seems to be common, with prevalence estimates ranging from 20% to 83%. Few patient groups have policies that govern corporate sponsorship. Transparency about corporate funding\nis also inadequate. Among the few studies that examined associations between industry funding and organisational positions, industry funded groups tended to have positions favourable to the sponsor. Patient groups have\nan important role in advocacy, education, and research, therefore strategies are needed to prevent biases that could favour the interests of sponsors above those of the public.

DESIGN:\nSelf controlled case series. SETTING: UK general practices contributing to Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: 9604 adults (>/=18 years) with a diagnosis of herpes zoster (in primary care or hospital\nrecords) between 1997 and 2018, who during their observation period lived with a child (<18 years) with a diagnosis of varicella. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative incidence of herpes zoster in\nthe 20 years after exposure to a child with varicella in the household compared with baseline time (all other time, excluding the 60 days before exposure). RESULTS: 6584 of the\n9604 adults with herpes zoster (68.6%) were women. Median age of exposure to a child with varicella was 38.3 years (interquartile range 32.3-48.8 years) and median observation period was 14.7\n(11.1-17.7) years. 4116 adults developed zoster in the baseline period, 433 in the 60 days before exposure and 5055 in the risk period. After adjustment for age, calendar time, and\nseason, strong evidence suggested that in the two years after household exposure to a child with varicella, adults were 33% less likely to develop zoster (incidence ratio 0.67, 95% confidence\ninterval 0.62 to 0.73) compared with baseline time. In the 10-20 years after exposure, adults were 27% less likely to develop herpes zoster (0.73, 0.62 to 0.87) compared with baseline\ntime. A stronger boosting effect was observed among men than among women after exposure to varicella. CONCLUSIONS: The relative incidence of zoster was lower in the periods after exposure to\na household contact with varicella, with modest but long lasting protective effects observed.

DESIGN: Meta-epidemiological study. DATA SOURCE: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013-14). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Meta-analyses with both blinded and non-blinded trials\non any topic. REVIEW METHODS: Blinding status was retrieved from trial publications and authors, and results retrieved automatically from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Bayesian hierarchical models estimated the\naverage ratio of odds ratios (ROR), and estimated the increases in heterogeneity between trials, for non-blinded trials (or of unclear status) versus blinded trials. Secondary analyses adjusted for adequacy of\nconcealment of allocation, attrition, and trial size, and explored the association between outcome subjectivity (high, moderate, low) and average bias. An ROR lower than 1 indicated exaggerated effect estimates in\ntrials without blinding. RESULTS: The study included 142 meta-analyses (1153 trials). The ROR for lack of blinding of patients was 0.91 (95% credible interval 0.61 to 1.34) in 18 meta-analyses\nwith patient reported outcomes, and 0.98 (0.69 to 1.39) in 14 meta-analyses with outcomes reported by blinded observers. The ROR for lack of blinding of healthcare providers was 1.01 (0.84\nto 1.19) in 29 meta-analyses with healthcare provider decision outcomes (eg, readmissions), and 0.97 (0.64 to 1.45) in 13 meta-analyses with outcomes reported by blinded patients or observers. The ROR\nfor lack of blinding of observers was 1.01 (0.86 to 1.18) in 46 meta-analyses with subjective observer reported outcomes, with no clear impact of degree of subjectivity. Information was insufficient\nto determine whether lack of blinding was associated with increased heterogeneity between trials. The ROR for trials not reported as double blind versus those that were double blind was 1.02\n(0.90 to 1.13) in 74 meta-analyses. CONCLUSION: No evidence was found for an average difference in estimated treatment effect between trials with and without blinded patients, healthcare providers, or outcome\nassessors.

Objective: To determine whether renal denervation when added to pulmonary vein isolation\nenhances long-term antiarrhythmic efficacy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Evaluate Renal Denervation in Addition to Catheter Ablation to Eliminate Atrial Fibrillation (ERADICATE-AF) trial was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, single-blind, randomized clinical\ntrial conducted at 5 referral centers for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in the Russian Federation, Poland, and Germany. A total of 302 patients with hypertension despite taking at least\n1 antihypertensive medication, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and plans for ablation were enrolled from April 2013 to March 2018. Follow-up concluded in March 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomized to either pulmonary\nvein isolation alone (n = 148) or pulmonary vein isolation plus renal denervation (n = 154). Complete pulmonary vein isolation to v an end point of elimination of all pulmonary\nvein potentials; renal denervation using an irrigated-tip ablation catheter delivering radiofrequency energy to discrete sites in a spiral pattern from distal to proximal in both renal arteries. Main Outcomes and\nMeasures: The primary end point was freedom from atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia at 12 months. Secondary end points included procedural complications within 30 days and blood pressure\ncontrol at 6 and 12 months. Results: Of the 302 randomized patients (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 55-65 years]; 182 men [60.3%]), 283 (93.7%) completed the trial. All successfully\nunderwent their assigned procedures. Freedom from atrial fibrillation, flutter, or tachycardia at 12 months was observed in 84 of 148 (56.5%) of those undergoing pulmonary vein isolation alone and in\n111 of 154 (72.1%) of those undergoing pulmonary vein isolation plus renal denervation (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.85; P = .006). Of 5 prespecified secondary end points,\n4 are reported and 3 differed between groups. Mean systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 months decreased from 151 mm Hg to 147 mm Hg in the isolation-only group\nand from 150 mm Hg to 135 mm Hg in the renal denervation group (between-group difference, -13 mm Hg; 95% CI, -15 to -11 mm Hg; P < .001). Procedural\ncomplications occurred in 7 patients (4.7%) in the isolation-only group and 7 (4.5%) of the renal denervation group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension, renal\ndenervation added to catheter ablation, compared with catheter ablation alone, significantly increased the likelihood of freedom from atrial fibrillation at 12 months. The lack of a formal sham-control renal denervation\nprocedure should be considered in interpreting the results of this trial.

Observational studies have suggested that earlier surgery could mitigate disease progression, providing\nbetter pain control and preserving pancreatic function. Objective: To determine whether early surgery is more effective than the endoscopy-first approach in terms of clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: The\nESCAPE trial was an unblinded, multicenter, randomized clinical superiority trial involving 30 Dutch hospitals participating in the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group. From April 2011 until September 2016, a total of\n88 patients with chronic pancreatitis, a dilated main pancreatic duct, and who only recently started using prescribed opioids for severe pain (strong opioids for </=2 months or weak opioids for\n</=6 months) were included. The 18-month follow-up period ended in March 2018. Interventions: There were 44 patients randomized to the early surgery group who underwent pancreatic drainage surgery within 6\nweeks after randomization and 44 patients randomized to the endoscopy-first approach group who underwent medical treatment, endoscopy including lithotripsy if needed, and surgery if needed. Main Outcomes and Measures: The\nprimary outcome was pain, measured on the Izbicki pain score and integrated over 18 months (range, 0-100 [increasing score indicates more pain severity]). Secondary outcomes were pain relief at the\nend of follow-up; number of interventions, complications, hospital admissions; pancreatic function; quality of life (measured on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]); and mortality. Results: Among 88 patients who\nwere randomized (mean age, 52 years; 21 (24%) women), 85 (97%) completed the trial. During 18 months of follow-up, patients in the early surgery group had a lower Izbicki pain\nscore than patients in the group randomized to receive the endoscopy-first approach group (37 vs 49; between-group difference, -12 points [95% CI, -22 to -2]; P = .02). Complete or\npartial pain relief at end of follow-up was achieved in 23 of 40 patients (58%) in the early surgery vs 16 of 41 (39%)in the endoscopy-first approach group (P =\n.10). The total number of interventions was lower in the early surgery group (median, 1 vs 3; P < .001). Treatment complications (27% vs 25%), mortality (0% vs 0%), hospital\nadmissions, pancreatic function, and quality of life were not significantly different between early surgery and the endoscopy-first approach. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with chronic pancreatitis, early surgery compared with\nan endoscopy-first approach resulted in lower pain scores when integrated over 18 months. However, further research is needed to assess persistence of differences over time and to replicate the study\nfindings.

Objective: To\nevaluate the effect of HES 130/0.4 compared with 0.9% saline for intravascular volume expansion on mortality and postoperative complications after major abdominal surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group,\nrandomized clinical trial of 775 adult patients at increased risk of postoperative kidney injury undergoing major abdominal surgery at 20 university hospitals in France from February 2016 to July 2018;\nfinal follow-up was in October 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive fluid containing either 6% HES 130/0.4 diluted in 0.9% saline (n = 389) or 0.9% saline alone (n\n= 386) in 250-mL boluses using an individualized hemodynamic algorithm during surgery and for up to 24 hours on the first postoperative day, defined as ending at 7:59 am the\nfollowing day.

Geometric mean maximum plasma concentrations of all 6 active ingredients were greater than 0.5 ng/mL, and this threshold\nwas surpassed on day 1 after a single application for all active ingredients. For avobenzone, the overall maximum plasma concentrations were 7.1 ng/mL (coefficient of variation [CV], 73.9%) for lotion,\n3.5 ng/mL (CV, 70.9%) for aerosol spray, 3.5 ng/mL (CV, 73.0%) for nonaerosol spray, and 3.3 ng/mL (CV, 47.8%) for pump spray.

In this trial of anti-thymocyte globulin, we measured treatment-independence at a long-term\ntimepoint as the primary endpoint. METHODS: This was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial done at ten centres in Canada and one in Australia. Eligible patients had a haematological\nmalignancy (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or lymphoma), were between 16 and 70 years of age, eligible for transplantation with a Karnofsky score of at least 60, and received an unrelated donor\n(fully matched or one-locus mismatched at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, or DRB1 loci) graft following myeloablative or non-myeloablative-reduced intensity conditioning. Patients were randomly assigned to receive anti-thymocyte globulin 4.5 mg/kg plus\nstandard GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporine or tacrolimus plus methotrexate or mycophenolate) or standard GVHD prophylaxis alone. The primary endpoint, freedom from immunosuppressive therapy without resumption at 12 months, was previously reported.\nHere we report on the prespecified 24-month analysis. Analyses were per-protocol, excluding those patients who did not proceed to transplantation. This trial is registered as ISRCTN 29899028 and NCT01217723, status\ncompleted. FINDINGS: Between June 9, 2010, and July 8, 2013, we recruited and randomly assigned 203 eligible patients to receive anti-thymocyte globulin (n=101) or no additional treatment (n=102) along with\nstandard GVHD prophylaxis. 7 (3%) patients did not receive a transplant and were excluded from the analysis. 38 (38%) of 99 evaluable patients in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis\ngroup were free from immunosuppressive therapy at 24 months compared with 18 (19%) of 97 patients in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.49 [95% CI 1.60-7.60];\np=0.0016). At 24 months, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 16.3% (95% CI 8.9-23.7) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group compared with 17.5 (9.9-25.1) in the standard GVHD\nprophylaxis group (p=0.73) and non-relapse mortality was 21.2% (95% CI 13.2-29.2) versus 31.3% (21.9-40.7; p=0.15). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 24 months was 26.3% (95% CI 17.5-35.1) in\nthe anti-thymocyte globulin group and 41.3% (31.3-51.3) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0.032). Overall survival at 24 months was 70.6% (95% CI 60.6-78.6) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD\nprophylaxis group compared with 53.3% (42.8-62.8) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI [0.35-0.90]; p=0.017). Symptoms of chronic GVHD by the Lee Scale were\nmore prevalent in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, with scores of 13.27 (SD 10.94) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group and 20.38 (SD 14.68) in the standard GVHD\nprophylaxis group (p=0.040). Depressive symptoms were more prominent in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, the mean Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) scores were 10.40 (SD 9.88) in the\nanti-thymocyte globulin group and 14.62 (SD 12.26) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0.034). Serious adverse events (CTCAE grade 4 or 5) occurred in 38 (38%) patients in the anti-thymocyte\nglobulin group and in 49 (51%) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, the most common being infection and GVHD. One patient in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group died\nof Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis, but no deaths were attributable to anti-thymocyte globulin. INTERPRETATION: The results of this prespecified 24-month analysis suggest that pretreatment with anti-thymocyte globulin provides clinically meaningful benefits\nwhen added to standard GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing unrelated donor transplantation, including decreases in use of immunosuppressive therapy, chronic GVHD and its symptoms, depressive symptoms, and improved overall survival.\nAnti-thymocyte globulin should be included in the preparative regimens of patients with haematological malignancies selected for unrelated donor transplantation.

The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) of 2007 now requires sponsors of applicable trials to report their results directly onto ClinicalTrials.gov within 1 year of completion.\nThe first trials covered by the Final Rule of this act became due to report results in January, 2018. In this cohort study, we set out to assess compliance. METHODS:\nWe downloaded data for all registered trials on ClinicalTrials.gov each month from March, 2018, to September, 2019. All cross-sectional analyses in this manuscript were performed on data extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov\non Sept 16, 2019; monthly trends analysis used archived data closest to the 15th day of each month from March, 2018, to September, 2019. Our study cohort included all applicable\ntrials due to report results under FDAAA. We excluded all non-applicable trials, those not yet due to report, and those given a certificate allowing for delayed reporting. A trial was\nconsidered reported if results had been submitted and were either publicly available, or undergoing quality control review at ClinicalTrials.gov. A trial was considered compliant if these results were submitted within\n1 year of the primary completion date, as required by the legislation. We described compliance with the FDAAA 2007 Final Rule, assessed trial characteristics associated with results reporting using logistic\nregression models, described sponsor-level reporting, examined trends in reporting, and described time-to-report using the Kaplan-Meier method. FINDINGS: 4209 trials were due to report results; 1722 (40.9%; 95% CI 39.4-42.2) did\nso within the 1-year deadline. 2686 (63.8%; 62.4-65.3) trials had results submitted at any time. Compliance has not improved since July, 2018. Industry sponsors were significantly more likely to be\ncompliant than non-industry, non-US Government sponsors (odds ratio [OR] 3.08 [95% CI 2.52-3.77]), and sponsors running large numbers of trials were significantly more likely to be compliant than smaller sponsors\n(OR 11.84 [9.36-14.99]). The median delay from primary completion date to submission date was 424 days (95% CI 412-435), 59 days higher than the legal reporting requirement of 1 year.\nINTERPRETATION: Compliance with the FDAAA 2007 is poor, and not improving. To our knowledge, this is the first study to fully assess compliance with the Final Rule of the FDAAA\n2007. Poor compliance is likely to reflect lack of enforcement by regulators.

Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) enables more precise ocular incisions and lens fragmentation than does phacoemulsification cataract\nsurgery (PCS). We hypothesised that FLACS might improve outcomes in cataract surgery compared with PCS despite having higher costs. METHODS: We did a participant-masked randomised superiority clinical trial comparing FLACS\nand PCS in two parallel groups (permuted block randomisation stratified on centres via a centralised web-based application, allocation ratio 1:1, block size of 2 or 4 for unilateral cases and\n2 or 6 for bilateral cases). Five French University Hospitals enrolled consecutive patients aged 22 years or older who were eligible for unilateral or bilateral cataract surgery. Participants, outcome assessors,\nand technicians carrying out examinations were masked to the surgical treatment allocation until the last follow-up visit and a sham laser procedure was set up for participants randomly assigned to\nthe PCS arm. The primary clinical endpoint was the success rate of surgery, defined as a composite of four outcomes at a 3-month postoperative visit: absence of severe perioperative complication,\na best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.0 LogMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) or better, an absolute refractive error of 0.75 dioptres or less, and unchanged postoperative corneal\nastigmatism power (</=0.5 dioptres) and axis (</=20 degrees ). The primary economic endpoint was the incremental cost per additional patient who had treatment success at 3 months. Primary outcomes were\nassessed in all randomly assigned patients who met all eligibility criteria (missing data considered as failure). We used mixed logistic regression models or mixed linear regression models for statistical comparisons,\nadjusted on centres and whether cataract surgery was bilateral or unilateral. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01982006. FINDINGS: Of the 907 patients (1476 eyes) randomly assigned between Oct 9,\n2013, and Oct 30, 2015, 870 (704 eyes in FLACS group and 685 eyes in the PCS group) were analysed. We identified no significant difference in the success rate of\nsurgery between the FLACS and PCS groups (FLACS: 41.1% [289 eyes]; PCS: 43.6% [299 eyes]); adjusted odds ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.64-1.12, p=0.250). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro10 703\nsaved per additional patient who had treatment success with PCS compared with FLACS. We observed no severe adverse events during the femtosecond laser procedure, and most of the complications in\nthe FLACS group related to the primary outcome measures occurred during the phacoemulsification phase or postoperatively. INTERPRETATION: Despite its advanced technology, femtosecond laser was not superior to phacoemulsification in cataract\nsurgery and, with higher costs, did not provide an additional benefit over phacoemulsification for patients or health-care systems.

It is considered a major cause of health loss, but data for the global burden of\nsepsis are limited. As a syndrome caused by underlying infection, sepsis is not part of standard Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) estimates. Accurate estimates are\nimportant to inform and monitor health policy interventions, allocation of resources, and clinical treatment initiatives. We estimated the global, regional, and national incidence of sepsis and mortality from this disorder\nusing data from GBD 2017. METHODS: We used multiple cause-of-death data from 109 million individual death records to calculate mortality related to sepsis among each of the 282 underlying causes\nof death in GBD 2017. The percentage of sepsis-related deaths by underlying GBD cause in each location worldwide was modelled using mixed-effects linear regression. Sepsis-related mortality for each age group,\nsex, location, GBD cause, and year (1990-2017) was estimated by applying modelled cause-specific fractions to GBD 2017 cause-of-death estimates. We used data for 8.7 million individual hospital records to calculate\nin-hospital sepsis-associated case-fatality, stratified by underlying GBD cause. In-hospital sepsis-associated case-fatality was modelled for each location using linear regression, and sepsis incidence was estimated by applying modelled case-fatality to sepsis-related\nmortality estimates. FINDINGS: In 2017, an estimated 48.9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 38.9-62.9) incident cases of sepsis were recorded worldwide and 11.0 million (10.1-12.0) sepsis-related deaths were reported, representing\n19.7% (18.2-21.4) of all global deaths. Age-standardised sepsis incidence fell by 37.0% (95% UI 11.8-54.5) and mortality decreased by 52.8% (47.7-57.5) from 1990 to 2017. Sepsis incidence and mortality varied\nsubstantially across regions, with the highest burden in sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, south Asia, east Asia, and southeast Asia. INTERPRETATION: Despite declining age-standardised incidence and mortality, sepsis remains a major cause\nof health loss worldwide and has an especially high health-related burden in sub-Saharan Africa.

Psychosocial interventions for these conditions might have a key role in their treatment, although applicability of findings to poor-resource settings\nmight be a challenge. We aimed to evaluate the strength and credibility of evidence generated in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) on the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for various mental\nhealth outcomes. METHODS: We did an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised studies done in LMICs. Literature searches were done in Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos from\nJan 1, 2010, until May 31, 2019. Systematic reviews of randomised studies investigating the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for mental health conditions in LMICs were included. Systematic reviews of promotion,\nprevention, and protection interventions were excluded, because the focus was on treatment interventions only. Information on first author, year of publication, outcomes, number of included studies, and reported summary meta-analytic\nestimates was extracted from included meta-analyses. Summary effects were recalculated using a common metric and random-effects models. We assessed between-study heterogeneity, predictive intervals, publication bias, small-study effects, and whether the\nresults of the observed positive studies were more than expected by chance. On the basis of these calculations, strength of associations was assessed using quantitative umbrella review criteria, and credibility\nof evidence using the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019135711. FINDINGS: 123 primary studies from ten systematic reviews were included. The evidence on the efficacy of\npsychosocial interventions in adults with depression in humanitarian settings (standardised mean difference 0.87, 95% CI 0.67-1.07; highly suggestive association, GRADE: moderate) and in adults with common mental disorders (0.49, 0.36-0.62;\nhighly suggestive association, GRADE: moderate) was supported by the most robust evidence. Highly suggestive strength of association was found for psychosocial interventions in adults with schizophrenia for functional outcomes, in\nadults with depression, and in adults with post-traumatic stress disorder in humanitarian settings. In children in humanitarian settings, and in children with disruptive behaviour, psychosocial interventions were supported by suggestive\nevidence of efficacy. INTERPRETATION: A relatively large amount of evidence suggests the benefit of psychosocial interventions on various mental health outcomes in LMICs. However, strength of associations and credibility of\nevidence were quite variable, depending on the target mental health condition, type of population and setting, and outcome of interest. This varied evidence should be considered in the development of\nclinical, policy, and implementation programmes in LMICs and should prompt further studies to improve the strength and credibility of the evidence base.

The aim of this study was to\ncompare the quality-adjusted effectiveness and costs of five modern treatment options for transplantation-eligible patients with newly diagnosed advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was developed using a 20-year\ntime horizon. Five of the most common treatment approaches were selected based on clinical experience and expert opinion: (1) six cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD), including data from\nthe HD2000 trial, Viviani and colleagues, and EORTC trial; (2) six cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP; from the HD15 trial or PET-adapted as in\nthe HD18 trial, two initial cycles of BEACOPP followed by four additional cycles for patients with a positive PET and either two or four additional cycles of BEACOPP for patients\nwith a negative PET); (3) PET-adapted escalation (as in the RATHL trial, two cycles of standard ABVD chemotherapy followed by an additional four cycles of ABVD or AVD in PET-negative\npatients and four cycles of BEACOPP in PET-positive patients); (4) six cycles of brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (A-AVD) or ABVD as in the Echelon-1 trial; and (5) PET-adapted de-escalation\n(as in the AHL2011 trial, two cycles of BEACOPP followed by PET2 scan; PET-positive patients received two additional BEACOPP cycles and PET-negative patients received two cycles of ABVD; at PET4,\nPET-negative patients completed two further cycles of either ABVD or BEACOPP depending on what they received after PET2, and PET-positive patients received salvage therapy). Note that all uses of BEACOPP\nin these strategies were BEACOPPescalated. The randomised groups of interest from these studies comprised 4255 patients enrolled between April, 2000, and January, 2016. Baseline probability estimates and utilities were derived\nfrom the included trials in addition to a systematic review of published studies. A Canadian public health payer's perspective was considered (CAN$1=US$0.74) and adjusted for inflation for 2018. All costs\nand benefits were discounted by 1.5% per year because life-years now are more valuable than future potential life-years. FINDINGS: Probabilistic analyses (10 000 simulations) showed that, for a willingness-to-pay threshold\nof CAN$50 000, a PET-adapted de-escalation strategy based on AHL2011 was more cost-effective 87% of the time. This strategy had the highest number of life-years (14.6 years [95% CI 13.7-15.1])\nand quality-adjusted life years (13.2 years [95% CI 10.2-14.4]), and the lowest direct costs ($53 129 [95% CI 31 914-94 446]) compared with the other treatment regimens. Sensitivity analyses showed\nthat the model was robust to key variables, including probability of treatment-related mortality, relapse, frequency of secondary malignancy, death from secondary malignancy, and probability of infertility after BEACOPP. INTERPRETATION: Our\nresults suggest that, when considering cost, effectiveness, and short and long-term toxicities, the preferred treatment strategy for patients with newly diagnosed advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma is the PET-adapted de-escalation regimen starting\nwith BEACOPP and de-escalating to ABVD as appropriate. Although our findings do not provide an absolute best treatment approach for clinicians to follow for all patients, they can contribute to\nshared decision making between patients and treating physicians.

Additionally, beta-arrestin directly regulates many cell signalling pathways that can induce\ncellular responses distinct from that of G proteins(2). In contrast to G proteins, for which there are many high-resolution structures in complex with GPCRs, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction\nof beta-arrestin with GPCRs are much less understood. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of beta-arrestin 1 (betaarr1) in complex with M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs.\nThe M2R-betaarr1 complex displays a multimodal network of flexible interactions, including binding of the N domain of betaarr1 to phosphorylated receptor residues and insertion of the finger loop of betaarr1\ninto the M2R seven-transmembrane bundle, which adopts a conformation similar to that in the M2R-heterotrimeric Go protein complex(3). Moreover, the cryo-electron microscopy map reveals that the C-edge of betaarr1 engages\nthe lipid bilayer. Through atomistic simulations and biophysical, biochemical and cellular assays, we show that the C-edge is critical for stable complex formation, betaarr1 recruitment, receptor internalization, and desensitization of\nG-protein activation.

DESIGN:\nRetrospective cohort study. SETTING: Medicare claims data for 2008-16 in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 or older admitted to hospital with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or pneumonia-conditions\nincluded in the US Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Post-discharge 30 day mortality according to patients' 30 day acute care utilization; acute care utilization in inpatient and observation\nunits and the emergency department during the 30 day and 31-90 day post-discharge period. RESULTS: 3 772 924 hospital admissions for heart failure, 1 570 113 for acute myocardial infarction,\nand 3 131 162 for pneumonia occurred. The overall post-discharge 30 day mortality was 8.7% for heart failure, 7.3% for acute myocardial infarction, and 8.4% for pneumonia. Risk adjusted mortality\nincreased annually by 0.05% (95% confidence interval 0.02% to 0.08%) for heart failure, decreased by 0.06% (-0.09% to -0.04%) for acute myocardial infarction, and did not significantly change for pneumonia.\nSpecifically, mortality increased for patients with heart failure who did not utilize any post-discharge acute care, increasing at a rate of 0.08% (0.05% to 0.12%) per year, exceeding the overall\nabsolute annual increase in post-discharge mortality in heart failure, without an increase in mortality in observation units or the emergency department. Concurrent with a reduction in 30 day readmission rates,\nstays for observation and visits to the emergency department increased across all three conditions during and beyond the 30 day post-discharge period. Overall 30 day post-acute care utilization did not\nchange significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The only condition with increasing mortality through the study period was heart failure; the increase preceded the policy and was not present among patients who received emergency\ndepartment or observation unit care without admission to hospital.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 27 institutions participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. PARTICIPANTS: 23 462 five year survivors (6193 (26.4%) treated in the 1970s, 9363 (39.9%)\ntreated in the 1980s, and 7906 (33.6%) treated in the 1990s) of leukemia, brain cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, renal tumors, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcomas, and bone sarcomas diagnosed prior\nto age 21 years between 1 January 1970 and 31 December 1999. Median age at diagnosis was 6.1 years (range 0-20.9) and 27.7 years (8.2-58.3) at last follow-up. A comparison\ngroup of 5057 siblings of cancer survivors were also included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence and 95% confidence intervals of reported heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, pericardial\ndisease, and arrhythmias by treatment decade. Events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Multivariable subdistribution hazard models were used to estimate hazard\nratios by decade, and mediation analysis examined risks with and without exposure to cardiotoxic treatments. RESULTS: The 20 year cumulative incidence of heart failure (0.69% for those treated in the\n1970s, 0.74% for those treated in the 1980s, 0.54% for those treated in the 1990s) and coronary artery disease (0.38%, 0.24%, 0.19%, respectively), decreased in more recent eras (P<0.01), though\nnot for valvular disease (0.06%, 0.06%, 0.05%), pericardial disease (0.04%, 0.02%, 0.03%), or arrhythmias (0.08%, 0.09%, 0.13%). Compared with survivors with a diagnosis in the 1970s, the risk of heart\nfailure, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease decreased in the 1980s and 1990s but only significantly for coronary artery disease (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.92\nand 0.53, 0.36 to 0.77, respectively). The overall risk of coronary artery disease was attenuated by adjustment for cardiac radiation (0.90, 0.78 to 1.05), particularly among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma\n(unadjusted for radiation: 0.77, 0.66 to 0.89; adjusted for radiation: 0.87, 0.69 to 1.10). CONCLUSIONS: Historical reductions in exposure to cardiac radiation have been associated with a reduced risk of\ncoronary artery disease among adult survivors of childhood cancer. Additional follow-up is needed to investigate risk reductions for other cardiac outcomes.

A major challenge for the US\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) is to achieve an appropriate balance between rigorous testing and the need for timely approval of drugs that have benefits that outweigh their risks. Objective:\nTo describe the evolution of laws and standards affecting drug testing, the use of new approval programs and standards, expansions of the role and authority of the FDA, and changes\nin the number of drugs approved from the 1980s to 2018. Evidence: Sources of evidence included principal federal laws and FDA regulations (1962-2018) and FDA databases of approved new drugs\n(1984-2018), generic drugs (1970-2018), biologics (1984-2018), and vaccines (1998-2018); special development and approval programs (Orphan drug [1984-2018], Fast-Track [1988-2018], Priority Review and its predecessors [1984-2018], Accelerated Approval [1992-2018], and Breakthrough\nTherapy [2012-2018]); expanded access (2010-2017) and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (2008-2018); and user fees paid to the FDA by industry (1993-2018). Findings: From 1983 to 2018, legislation and regulatory\ninitiatives have substantially changed drug approval at the FDA. The mean annual number of new drug approvals, including biologics, was 34 from 1990-1999, 25 from 2000-2009, and 41 from 2010-2018.\nNew biologic product approvals increased from a median of 2.5 from 1990-1999, to 5 from 2000-2013, to 12 from 2014-2018. The median annual number of generic drugs approved was 136\nfrom 1970 to the enactment of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984; 284 from 1985 to the enactment of the Generic Drug User Fee Act in 2012; and 588 from 2013-2018.\nPrescription drug user fee funding expanded from new drugs and biologics in 1992 to generic and biosimilar drugs in 2012. The amount of Prescription Drug User Fee Act fees collected\nfrom industry increased from an annual mean of $66 million in 1993-1997 to $820 million in 2013-2017, and in 2018, user fees accounted for approximately 80% of the salaries of\nreview personnel responsible for the approval of new drugs. The proportion of drugs approved with an Orphan Drug Act designation increased from 18% (55/304) in 1984-1995, to 22% (82/379) in\n1996-2007, to 41% (154/380) in 2008-2018. Use of Accelerated Approval, Fast-Track, and Priority Review for new drugs has increased over time, with 81% (48/59) of new drugs benefiting from at\nleast 1 such expedited program in 2018. The proportion of new approvals supported by at least 2 pivotal trials decreased from 80.6% in 1995-1997 to 52.8% in 2015-2017, based on\n124 and 106 approvals, respectively, while the median number of patients studied did not change significantly (774 vs 816). FDA drug review times declined from more than 3 years in\n1983 to less than 1 year in 2017, but total time from the authorization of clinical testing to approval has remained at approximately 8 years over that period. Conclusions and\nRelevance: Over the last 4 decades, the approval and regulation processes for pharmaceutical agents have evolved and increased in complexity as special programs have been added and as the use\nof surrogate measures has been encouraged. The FDA funding needed to implement and manage these programs has been addressed by expanding industry-paid user fees. The FDA has increasingly accepted less\ndata and more surrogate measures, and has shortened its review times.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31935033", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31935032", "Title": "Doctoring and Deportation.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/11 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 14", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31935032", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31935030", "Title": "Cognitive Testing of Older Clinicians Prior to Recredentialing.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/11 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 14", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31935030", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31935029", "Title": "Periorbital and Orbital Cellulitis.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/11 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 14", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31935029", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31935028", "Title": "Effect of Osocimab in Preventing Venous Thromboembolism Among Patients Undergoing Knee Arthroplasty: The FOXTROT Randomized Clinical Trial.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/11 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 14", "Abstract": "Importance: The efficacy of factor XIa inhibition for thromboprophylaxis is unknown.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, open-label, adjudicator-blinded, phase 2 noninferiority trial with observer blinding for osocimab doses,\nconducted at 54 hospitals in 13 countries. Adult patients undergoing unilateral knee arthroplasty were randomized from October 2017 through August 2018 and followed up until January 2019. Interventions: Single intravenous\nosocimab postoperative doses of 0.3 mg/kg (n = 107), 0.6 mg/kg (n = 65), 1.2 mg/kg (n = 108), or 1.8 mg/kg (n = 106); preoperative doses of 0.3 mg/kg\n(n = 109) or 1.8 mg/kg (n = 108); or 40 mg of subcutaneous enoxaparin once daily (n = 105) or 2.5 mg of oral apixaban twice daily (n =\n105) for at least 10 days or until venography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was venous thromboembolism incidence between 10 and 13 days postoperatively (assessed by mandatory bilateral\nvenography performed 10 to 13 days after surgery or confirmed symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). A 5% noninferiority margin compared with enoxaparin was chosen. The primary safety outcome\nof major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was assessed until 10 to 13 days postoperatively. Results: Of 813 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 66.5 years [8.2 years]; body mass index,\n32.7 [5.7]; and 74.2% women), 600 were included in the per-protocol population used for the primary analysis. The primary outcome occurred in 18 patients (23.7%) receiving 0.3 mg/kg, 8 (15.7%)\nreceiving 0.6 mg/kg, 13 (16.5%) receiving 1.2 mg/kg, and 14 (17.9%) receiving 1.8 mg/kg of osocimab postoperatively; 23 (29.9%) receiving 0.3 mg/kg and 9 (11.3%) receiving 1.8 mg/kg of osocimab\npreoperatively; 20 (26.3%) receiving enoxaparin; and 12 (14.5%) receiving apixaban. Osocimab given postoperatively met criteria for noninferiority compared with enoxaparin with risk differences (1-sided 95% CIs) of 10.6% (95% CI,\n-1.2% to infinity) at the 0.6-mg/kg dose; 9.9% (95% CI, -0.9% to infinity) at the 1.2-mg/kg dose, and 8.4% (95% CI, -2.6 to infinity) at the 1.8-mg/kg dose. The preoperative\ndose of 1.8 mg/kg of osocimab met criteria for superiority compared with enoxaparin with a risk difference of 15.1%; 2-sided 90% CI, 4.9% to 25.2%). Postoperative and preoperative doses of\n0.3 mg/kg of osocimab did not meet the prespecified criteria for noninferiority, with risk differences (1-sided 95% CIs) of 2.6% (95% CI, -8.9% to infinity) and -3.6% (95% CI, -15.5%\nto infinity), respectively. Major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was observed in up to 4.7% of those receiving osocimab, 5.9% receiving enoxaparin, and 2% receiving apixaban. Conclusions and Relevance: Among\npatients undergoing knee arthroplasty, postoperative osocimab 0.6 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, and 1.8 mg/kg met criteria for noninferiority compared with enoxaparin, and the preoperative 1.8-mg/kg dose of osocimab met criteria for\nsuperiority compared with enoxaparin for the primary outcome of incidence of venous thromboembolism at 10 to 13 days postoperatively. Further studies are needed to establish efficacy and safety of osocimab\nrelative to standard thromboprophylaxis.

Exposures: Treatment with active surveillance (n = 363), nerve-sparing prostatectomy (n\n= 675), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT; n = 261), or low-dose-rate brachytherapy (n = 87) for men with favorable-risk disease and treatment with prostatectomy (n = 402) or EBRT\nwith androgen deprivation therapy (n = 217) for men with unfavorable-risk disease. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient-reported function, based on the 26-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite (range, 0-100), 5 years\nafter treatment. Regression models were adjusted for baseline function and patient and tumor characteristics. Minimum clinically important difference was 10 to 12 for sexual function, 6 to 9 for urinary\nincontinence, 5 to 7 for urinary irritative symptoms, and 4 to 6 for bowel and hormonal function. Results: A total of 2005 men met inclusion criteria and completed the baseline\nand at least 1 postbaseline survey (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [59-70] years; 1529 of 1993 participants [77%] were non-Hispanic white). For men with favorable-risk prostate cancer, nerve-sparing prostatectomy was\nassociated with worse urinary incontinence at 5 years (adjusted mean difference, -10.9 [95% CI, -14.2 to -7.6]) and sexual function at 3 years (adjusted mean difference, -15.2 [95% CI, -18.8\nto -11.5]) compared with active surveillance.

Objective: To determine the effect of a behavioral\nintervention that increased vegetable intake on cancer progression in men with early-stage prostate cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Men's Eating and Living (MEAL) Study (CALGB 70807 [Alliance]) was a\nrandomized clinical trial conducted at 91 US urology and medical oncology clinics that enrolled 478 men aged 50 to 80 years with biopsy-proven prostate adenocarcinoma (International Society of Urological Pathology\ngrade group = 1 in those <70 years and </=2 in those >/=70 years), stage cT2a or less, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level less than 10 ng/mL. Enrollment occurred\nfrom January 2011 to August 2015; 24-month follow-up occurred from January 2013 to August 2017. Interventions: Patients were randomized to a counseling behavioral intervention by telephone promoting consumption of 7\nor more daily vegetable servings (MEAL intervention; n = 237) or a control group, which received written information about diet and prostate cancer (n = 241).

Conclusions and Relevance: Among men with early-stage prostate cancer managed with active surveillance,\na behavioral intervention that increased vegetable consumption did not significantly reduce the risk of prostate cancer progression. The findings do not support use of this intervention to decrease prostate cancer\nprogression in this population, although the study may have been underpowered to identify a clinically important difference.

However, available studies reflect older treatment and surveillance paradigms, and most have assessed risks for incident CRC without\ntaking surveillance and lead-time bias into account, such as by assessing CRC incidence by tumour stage, or stage-adjusted mortality from CRC. We aimed to compare both overall and country-specific risks\nof CRC mortality and incident CRC among patients with UC. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study of 96 447 patients with UC in Denmark (n=32 919) and Sweden (n=63 528),\npatients were followed up for CRC incidence and CRC mortality between Jan 1, 1969, and Dec 31, 2017, and compared with matched reference individuals from the general population (n=949 207).\nPatients with UC were selected from national registers and included in the analysis if they had two or more records with a relevant International Classification of Disease in the patient\nregister (in the country in question) or one such record plus a colorectal biopsy report with a morphology code suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease. For every patient with UC, we\nselected matched reference individuals from the total population registers of Denmark and Sweden, who were matched for sex, age, birth year, and place of residence. We used Cox regression to\ncompute hazard ratios (HRs) for incident CRC, and for CRC mortality, taking tumour stage into account. FINDINGS: During follow-up, we observed 1336 incident CRCs in the UC cohort (1.29 per\n1000 person-years) and 9544 incident CRCs in reference individuals (0.82 per 1000 person-years; HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.57-1.76). In the UC cohort, 639 patients died from CRC (0.55 per 1000\nperson-years), compared with 4451 reference individuals (0.38 per 1000 person-years; HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.46-1.72) during the same time period. The CRC stage distribution in people with UC was less\nadvanced (p<0.0001) than in matched reference individuals, but taking tumour stage into account, patients with UC and CRC remained at increased risk of CRC death (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.33-1.78).\nThe excess risks declined over calendar periods: during the last 5 years of follow-up (2013-17, Sweden only), the HR for incident CRC in people with UC was 1.38 (95% CI\n1.20-1.60, or one additional case per 1058 patients with UC per 5 years) and the HR for death from CRC was 1.25 (95% CI 1.03-1.51, or one additional case per\n3041 patients with UC per 5 years). INTERPRETATION: Compared with those without UC, individuals with UC are at increased risk of developing CRC, are diagnosed with less advanced CRC, and\nare at increased risk of dying from CRC, although these excess risks have declined substantially over time. There still seems to be room for improvement in international surveillance guidelines.

We examined the associated population mental health burden, risk factors, and health-care needs. METHODS: In a\npopulation-based prospective cohort, adult participants aged 18 years or older were assessed at nine timepoints from 2009. Probable depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (score >/=10) and suspected\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (score >/=14), plus direct exposure to traumatic events related to the ongoing social unrest. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify\nfactors associated with both outcomes, adjusting for doctor-diagnosed depression or anxiety disorders before the unrest. On the basis of routine service statistics and respondents' intention to seek professional care, we\nprojected the number of additional ambulatory specialist psychiatric visits required. FINDINGS: After the two baseline surveys, we followed up random subsets of 1213-1736 adults at each timepoint. Probable depression was\nreported by 11.2% (95% CI 9.8-12.7) of participants in 2019, compared with 1.9% (1.6-2.1) during 2009-14 and 6.5% (5.3-7.6) in 2017 after the Occupy Central Movement and before the current\nunrest. Prevalence of suspected PTSD in 2019 was estimated to be 12.8% (11.2-14.4). Age, sex, educational attainment, or household income were not associated with either outcome, whereas heavy social media\nuse (>/=2 h per day) was associated with both. Political attitude or protest participation was not associated with probable depression, but neutrality towards the extradition bill approximately halved the risk\nof suspected PTSD. Family support mitigated against probable depression. We estimated that the mental health burden identified would translate into roughly an excess 12% service requirement to the public sector\nqueue or equivalent. INTERPRETATION: We have identified a major mental health burden during the social unrest in Hong Kong, which will require substantial increases in service surge capacity. Health-care and\nsocial care professionals should be vigilant in recognising possible mental health sequelae. In a world of increasing unrest, our findings might have implications for service planning to better protect population\nmental health globally.

Objective: To identify\nevidence and narrative-based practices that promote clinician presence, a state of awareness, focus, and attention with the intent to understand patients. Evidence Review: Preliminary practices were derived through a systematic\nliterature review (from January 1997 to August 2017, with a subsequent bridge search to September 2019) of effective interpersonal interventions; observations of primary care encounters in 3 diverse clinics (n\n= 27 encounters); and qualitative interviews with physicians (n = 10), patients (n = 27), and nonmedical professionals whose occupations involve intense interpersonal interactions (eg, firefighter, chaplain, social worker; n\n= 30). After evidence synthesis, promising practices were reviewed in a 3-round modified Delphi process by a panel of 14 researchers, clinicians, patients, caregivers, and health system leaders. Panelists rated\neach practice using 9-point Likert scales (-4 to +4) that reflected the potential effect on patient and clinician experience and feasibility of implementation; after the third round, panelists selected their\n\"top 5\" practices from among those with median ratings of at least +2 for all 3 criteria. Final recommendations incorporate elements from all highly rated practices and emphasize the practices\nwith the greatest number of panelist votes. Findings: The systematic literature review (n = 73 studies) and qualitative research activities yielded 31 preliminary practices. Following evidence synthesis, 13 distinct practices\nwere reviewed by the Delphi panel, 8 of which met criteria for inclusion and were combined into a final set of 5 recommendations: (1) prepare with intention (take a moment\nto prepare and focus before greeting a patient); (2) listen intently and completely (sit down, lean forward, avoid interruptions); (3) agree on what matters most (find out what the patient\ncares about and incorporate these priorities into the visit agenda); (4) connect with the patient's story (consider life circumstances that influence the patient's health; acknowledge positive efforts; celebrate successes); and\n(5) explore emotional cues (notice, name, and validate the patient's emotions). Conclusions and Relevance: This mixed-methods study identified 5 practices that have the potential to enhance physician presence and meaningful\nconnection with patients in the clinical encounter. Evaluation and validation of the outcomes associated with implementing the 5 practices is needed, along with system-level interventions to create a supportive environment\nfor implementation.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31910284", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31910283", "Title": "Primarily Care.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/06 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 7", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31910283", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31910281", "Title": "Medications for Treating Infection.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/06 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 7", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31910281", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31910280", "Title": "Association of Powder Use in the Genital Area With Risk of Ovarian Cancer.", "JournalName": "JAMA", "Creation Date": "2020/02/06 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 7", "Abstract": "Importance: The relationship between use of powder in the genital area and ovarian cancer is not established. Positive associations reported in case-control studies have not been confirmed in cohort studies.\nObjective: To estimate the association between use of powder in the genital area and ovarian cancer using prospective observational data. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data were pooled from 4 large,\nUS-based cohorts: Nurses' Health Study (enrollment 1976; follow-up 1982-2016; n = 81869), Nurses' Health Study II (enrollment 1989; follow-up 2013-2017; n = 61261), Sister Study (enrollment 2003-2009; follow-up 2003-2017; n\n= 40647), and Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (enrollment 1993-1998; follow-up 1993-2017; n = 73267). Exposures: Ever, long-term (>/=20 years), and frequent (>/=1/week) use of powder in the genital area.\nMain Outcomes and Measures: The primary analysis examined the association between ever use of powder in the genital area and self-reported incident ovarian cancer. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%\nCIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The pooled sample included 252745 women (median age at baseline, 57 years) with 38% self-reporting use of powder in the genital\narea. Ten percent reported long-term use, and 22% reported frequent use. During a median of 11.2 years of follow-up (3.8 million person-years at risk), 2168 women developed ovarian cancer (58\ncases/100000 person-years). Ovarian cancer incidence was 61 cases/100000 person-years among ever users and 55 cases/100000 person-years among never users (estimated risk difference at age 70 years, 0.09% [95% CI, -0.02%\nto 0.19%]; estimated HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.17]).

However, no large-scale trial has examined the efficacy\nof this therapy for improving semen quality or live birth. Objective: To determine the effect of daily folic acid and zinc supplementation on semen quality and live birth. Design, Setting,\nand Participants: The Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation Trial was a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Couples (n = 2370; men aged >/=18 years and women aged 18-45 years) planning infertility\ntreatment were enrolled at 4 US reproductive endocrinology and infertility care study centers between June 2013 and December 2017. The last 6-month study visit for semen collection occurred during August\n2018, with chart abstraction of live birth and pregnancy information completed during April 2019. Interventions: Men were block randomized by study center and planned infertility treatment (in vitro fertilization, other\ntreatment at a study site, and other treatment at an outside clinic) to receive either 5 mg of folic acid and 30 mg of elemental zinc (n = 1185) or\nplacebo (n = 1185) daily for 6 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The co-primary outcomes were live birth (resulting from pregnancies occurring within 9 months of randomization) and semen quality\nparameters (sperm concentration, motility, morphology, volume, DNA fragmentation, and total motile sperm count) at 6 months after randomization. Results: Among 2370 men who were randomized (mean age, 33 years), 1773\n(75%) attended the final 6-month study visit. Live birth outcomes were available for all couples, and 1629 men (69%) had semen available for analysis at 6 months after randomization. Live\nbirth was not significantly different between treatment groups (404 [34%] in the folic acid and zinc group and 416 [35%] in the placebo group; risk difference, -0.9% [95% CI, -4.7%\nto 2.8%]). Most of the semen quality parameters (sperm concentration, motility, morphology, volume, and total motile sperm count) were not significantly different between treatment groups at 6 months after randomization.\nA statistically significant increase in DNA fragmentation was observed with folic acid and zinc supplementation (mean of 29.7% for percentage of DNA fragmentation in the folic acid and zinc group\nand 27.2% in the placebo group; mean difference, 2.4% [95% CI, 0.5% to 4.4%]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common with folic acid and zinc supplementation compared with placebo (abdominal discomfort\nor pain: 66 [6%] vs 40 [3%], respectively; nausea: 50 [4%] vs 24 [2%]; and vomiting: 32 [3%] vs 17 [1%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among a general population of couples\nseeking infertility treatment, the use of folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve semen quality or couples' live birth rates. These findings\ndo not support the use of folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners in the treatment of infertility.

Although laparoscopy can reduce adhesion formation, the effect of minimally invasive surgery on long-term adhesion-related morbidity remains\nunknown. We aimed to assess the impact of laparoscopy on adhesion-related readmissions in a population-based cohort. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study of patients of any age who had\nabdominal or pelvic surgery done using laparoscopic or open approaches between June 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011, using validated population data from the Scottish National Health Service. All patients\nwho had surgery were followed up until Dec 31, 2017. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of hospital readmissions directly related to adhesions in the laparoscopic and open surgery\ncohorts at 5 years. Readmissions were categorised as directly related to adhesions, possibly related to adhesions, and readmissions for an operation that was potentially complicated by adhesions. We did subgroup\nanalyses of readmissions by anatomical site of surgery and used Kaplan-Meier analyses to assess differences in survival across subgroups. We used multivariable Cox-regression analysis to determine whether surgical approach was\nan independent and significant risk factor for adhesion-related readmissions. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011, 72 270 patients had an index abdominal or pelvic surgery, of whom\n21 519 (29.8%) had laparoscopic index surgery and 50 751 (70.2%) had open surgery. Of the 72 270 patients who had surgery, 2527 patients (3.5%) were readmitted within 5 years\nof surgery for disorders directly related to adhesions, 12 687 (17.6%) for disorders possibly related to adhesions, and 9436 (13.1%) for operations potentially complicated by adhesions. Of the 21 519\npatients who had laparoscopic surgery, 359 (1.7% [95% CI 1.5-1.9]) were readmitted for disorders directly related to adhesions compared with 2168 (4.3% [4.1-4.5]) of 50 751 patients in the open\nsurgery cohort (p<0.0001). 3443 (16.0% [15.6-16.4]) of 21 519 patients in the laparoscopic surgery cohort were readmitted for disorders possibly related to adhesions compared with 9244 (18.2% [17.8-18.6]) of 50\n751 patients in the open surgery cohort (p<0.005). In multivariate analyses, laparoscopy reduced the risk of directly related readmissions by 32% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.60-0.77), and of\npossibly related readmissions by 11% (HR 0.89, 0.85-0.94) compared with open surgery. Procedure type, malignancy, sex, and age were also independently associated with risk of adhesion-related readmissions. INTERPRETATION: Laparoscopic surgery\nreduces the incidence of adhesion-related readmissions. However, the overall burden of readmissions associated with adhesions remains high. With further increases in the use of laparoscopic surgery expected in the future,\nthe effect at the population level might become larger. Further steps remain necessary to reduce the incidence of adhesion-related postsurgical complications.

In this report, we describe the prevalence and disease burden of each mental disorder for the states of India, from 1990 to 2017. METHODS: We\nused all accessible data from multiple sources to estimate the prevalence of mental disorders, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by these disorders for all the\nstates of India from 1990 to 2017, as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. We assessed the heterogeneity and time trends of mental disorders\nacross the states of India. We grouped states on the basis of their Socio-demographic Index (SDI), which is a composite measure of per-capita income, mean education, and fertility rate in\nwomen younger than 25 years. We also assessed the association of major mental disorders with suicide deaths. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates. FINDINGS: In 2017,\n197.3 million (95% UI 178.4-216.4) people had mental disorders in India, including 45.7 million (42.4-49.8) with depressive disorders and 44.9 million (41.2-48.9) with anxiety disorders. We found a significant, but\nmodest, correlation between the prevalence of depressive disorders and suicide death rate at the state level for females (r(2)=0.33, p=0.0009) and males (r(2)=0.19, p=0.015). The contribution of mental disorders to\nthe total DALYs in India increased from 2.5% (2.0-3.1) in 1990 to 4.7% (3.7-5.6) in 2017. In 2017, depressive disorders contributed the most to the total mental disorders DALYs (33.8%,\n29.5-38.5), followed by anxiety disorders (19.0%, 15.9-22.4), idiopathic developmental intellectual disability (IDID; 10.8%, 6.3-15.9), schizophrenia (9.8%, 7.7-12.4), bipolar disorder (6.9%, 4.9-9.6), conduct disorder (5.9%, 4.0-8.1), autism spectrum disorders (3.2%, 2.7-3.8),\neating disorders (2.2%, 1.7-2.8), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 0.3%, 0.2-0.5); other mental disorders comprised 8.0% (6.1-10.1) of DALYs. Almost all (>99.9%) of these DALYs were made up of YLDs.\nThe DALY rate point estimates of mental disorders with onset predominantly in childhood and adolescence (IDID, conduct disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and ADHD) were higher in low SDI states than\nin middle SDI and high SDI states in 2017, whereas the trend was reversed for mental disorders that manifest predominantly during adulthood. Although the prevalence of mental disorders with onset\nin childhood and adolescence decreased in India from 1990 to 2017, with a stronger decrease in high SDI and middle SDI states than in low SDI states, the prevalence of\nmental disorders that manifest predominantly during adulthood increased during this period. INTERPRETATION: One in seven Indians were affected by mental disorders of varying severity in 2017. The proportional contribution of\nmental disorders to the total disease burden in India has almost doubled since 1990. Substantial variations exist between states in the burden from different mental disorders and in their trends\nover time. These state-specific trends of each mental disorder reported here could guide appropriate policies and health system response to more effectively address the burden of mental disorders in India.\nFUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; and Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31879245", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31879230", "Title": "Clinical features and outcomes of patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia: a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study.", "JournalName": "The Lancet.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical features and\noutcomes of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, an inherited bone marrow failure disorder with high risk of developing myeloid malignancies. METHODS: We did a\nmulticentre, retrospective, cohort study in collaboration with the North American Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome Registry. We reviewed patient medical records from 17 centres in the USA and Canada. Patients with a genetic\n(biallelic mutations in the SBDS gene) or clinical diagnosis (cytopenias and pancreatic dysfunction) of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome who developed myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia were eligible without additional restriction. Medical\nrecords were reviewed between March 1, 2001, and Oct 5, 2017. Masked central review of bone marrow pathology was done if available to confirm leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosis. We\ndescribe the clinical features and overall survival of these patients. FINDINGS: We initially identified 37 patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia. 27 patients had samples\navailable for central pathology review and were reclassified accordingly (central diagnosis concurred with local in 15 [56%] cases), 10 had no samples available and were classified based on the local\nreview data, and 1 patient was excluded at this stage as not eligible. 36 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 10 (28%) initially presented with acute myeloid leukaemia\nand 26 (72%) initially presented with myelodysplastic syndrome. With a median follow-up of 4.9 years (IQR 3.9-8.4), median overall survival for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome was 7.7 years (95% CI\n0.8-not reached) and 0.99 years (95% CI 0.2-2.4) for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Overall survival at 3 years was 11% (95% CI 1-39) for patients with leukaemia and 51%\n(29-68) for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Management and surveillance were variable. 18 (69%) of 26 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome received upfront therapy (14 haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 4 chemotherapy),\n4 (15%) patients received no treatment, 2 (8%) had unavailable data, and 2 (8%) progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia before receiving treatment. 12 patients received treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia-including\nthe two patients initially diagnosed with myelodysplastic who progressed- two (16%) received HSCT as initial therapy and ten (83%) received chemotherapy with intent to proceed with HSCT. 33 (92%) of\n36 patients (eight of ten with leukaemia and 25 of 26 with myelodysplastic syndrome) were known to have Shwachman-Diamond syndrome before development of a myeloid malignancy and could have been\nmonitored with bone marrow surveillance. Bone marrow surveillance before myeloid malignancy diagnosis was done in three (33%) of nine patients with leukaemia for whom surveillance status was confirmed and 11\n(46%) of 24 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Patients monitored had a 3-year overall survival of 62% (95% CI 32-82; n=14) compared with 28% (95% CI 10-50; n=19; p=0.13) without surveillance.\nSix (40%) of 15 patients with available longitudinal data developed myelodysplastic syndrome in the setting of stable blood counts. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that prognosis is poor for patients with\nShwachman-Diamond syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia owing to both therapy-resistant disease and treatment-related toxicities. Improved surveillance algorithms and risk stratification tools, studies of clonal evolution, and prospective\ntrials are needed to inform effective prevention and treatment strategies for leukaemia predisposition in patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.

The\nNOBLE trial aimed to evaluate whether PCI was non-inferior to CABG in the treatment of left main coronary artery disease and reported outcomes after a median follow-up of 3.1 years.\nWe now report updated 5-year outcomes of the trial. METHODS: The prospective, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority NOBLE trial was done at 36 hospitals in nine northern European countries. Patients with left\nmain coronary artery disease requiring revascularisation were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PCI or CABG. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE), a composite\nof all-cause mortality, non-procedural myocardial infarction, repeat revascularisation, and stroke. Non-inferiority of PCI to CABG was defined as the upper limit of the 95% CI of the hazard ratio (HR)\nnot exceeding 1.35 after 275 MACCE had occurred. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, non-procedural myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularisation. Outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered\nwith ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01496651. FINDINGS: Between Dec 9, 2008, and Jan 21, 2015, 1201 patients were enrolled and allocated to PCI (n=598) or CABG (n=603), with 17 subsequently lost to early\nfollow-up. 592 patients in each group were included in this analysis. At a median of 4.9 years of follow-up, the predefined number of events was reached for adequate power to\nassess the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier 5-year estimates of MACCE were 28% (165 events) for PCI and 19% (110 events) for CABG (HR 1.58 [95% CI 1.24-2.01]); the HR exceeded the\nlimit for non-inferiority of PCI compared to CABG. CABG was found to be superior to PCI for the primary composite endpoint (p=0.0002). All-cause mortality was estimated in 9% after PCI\nversus 9% after CABG (HR 1.08 [95% CI 0.74-1.59]; p=0.68); non-procedural myocardial infarction was estimated in 8% after PCI versus 3% after CABG (HR 2.99 [95% CI 1.66-5.39]; p=0.0002); and\nrepeat revascularisation was estimated in 17% after PCI versus 10% after CABG (HR 1.73 [95% CI 1.25-2.40]; p=0.0009). INTERPRETATION: In revascularisation of left main coronary artery disease, PCI was associated\nwith an inferior clinical outcome at 5 years compared with CABG. Mortality was similar after the two procedures but patients treated with PCI had higher rates of non-procedural myocardial infarction\nand repeat revascularisation.

In the FLYER trial, we assessed whether four cycles\nof CHOP plus six applications of rituximab are non-inferior to six cycles of R-CHOP in a population of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with favourable prognosis. METHODS: This two-arm, open-label,\ninternational, multicentre, prospective, randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial was done at 138 clinical sites in Denmark, Israel, Italy, Norway, and Germany. We enrolled patients aged 18-60 years, with stage I-II\ndisease, normal serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, ECOG performance status 0-1, and without bulky disease (maximal tumour diameter <7.5 cm). Randomisation was computer-based and done centrally in a 1:1 ratio using\nthe Pocock minimisation algorithm after stratification for centres, stage (I vs II), and extralymphatic sites (no vs yes). Patients were assigned to receive either six cycles of R-CHOP or four\ncycles of R-CHOP plus two doses of rituximab. CHOP comprised cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2)), doxorubicin (50 mg/m(2)), and vincristine (1.4 mg/m(2), with a maximum total dose of 2 mg), all administered\nintravenously on day 1, plus oral prednisone or prednisolone at the discretion of the investigator (100 mg) administered on days 1-5. Rituximab was given at a dose of 375 mg/m(2)\nof body surface area. Cycles were repeated every 21 days. No radiotherapy was planned except for testicular lymphoma treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival after 3 years. The primary\nanalysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of assigned treatment. A non-inferiority margin of -5.5% was chosen. The\ntrial, which is completed, was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00278421. FINDINGS: Between Dec 2, 2005, and Oct 7, 2016, 592 patients were enrolled, of whom 295 patients were randomly assigned\nto receive six cycles of R-CHOP and 297 were assigned to receive four cycles of R-CHOP plus two doses of rituximab. Four patients in the four-cycles group withdrew informed consent\nbefore the start of treatment, so 588 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. After a median follow-up of 66 months (IQR 42-100), 3-year progression-free survival of patients who had\nfour cycles of R-CHOP plus two doses of rituximab was 96% (95% CI 94-99), which was 3% better (lower limit of the one-sided 95% CI for the difference was 0%)\nthan six cycles of R-CHOP, demonstrating the non-inferiority of the four-cycles regimen. 294 haematological and 1036 non-haematological adverse events were documented in the four-cycles group compared with 426 haematological and\n1280 non-haematological adverse events in the six-cycles group. Two patients, both in the six-cycles group, died during study therapy. INTERPRETATION: In young patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and favourable\nprognosis, four cycles of R-CHOP is non-inferior to six cycles of R-CHOP, with relevant reduction of toxic effects. Thus, chemotherapy can be reduced without compromising outcomes in this population.

Acalabrutinib is a selective, potent Bruton tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. The\naim of this trial was to evaluate the activity and safety of acalabrutinib in patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. METHODS: This single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial was done in 19 European\nacademic centres in France, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, and the UK, and eight academic centres in the USA. Eligible patients were 18 years or older and had treatment naive (declined\nor not eligible for chemoimmunotherapy) or relapsed or refractory (at least one previous therapy) Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia that required treatment, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less,\nand received no previous Bruton tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy. Patients received 100 mg oral acalabrutinib twice per day in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was\ninvestigator-assessed overall response (at least a minor response) according to the 6th International Workshop for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (IWWM) and the modified 3rd IWWM workshop criteria. The primary outcome and safety\nwere assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02180724, and is ongoing, but no longer enrolling. FINDINGS: Between\nSept 8, 2014, and Dec 24, 2015, 122 patients were assessed for eligibility, of which 106 (87%) patients were given acalabrutinib (14 were treatment naive and 92 had relapsed or\nrefractory disease). With a median follow-up of 27.4 months (IQR 26.0-29.7), 13 (93% [95% CI 66-100]) of 14 treatment naive patients achieved an overall response and 86 (93% [86-98]) of\n92 relapsed or refractory patients per both the modified 3rd and 6th IWWM criteria. Seven (50%) of 14 treatment naive patients and 23 (25%) of 92 relapsed or refractory patients\ndiscontinued treatment on study. Grade 3-4 adverse events occurring in more than 5% of patients were neutropenia (17 [16%] of 106 patients) and pneumonia (7 [7%]). Grade 3-4 atrial fibrillation\noccurred in one (1%) patient and grade 3-4 bleeding occurred in three (3%) patients. The most common serious adverse events were lower respiratory tract infection (n=7 [7%]), pneumonia (n=7 [7%]),\npyrexia (n=4 [4%]), cellulitis (n=3 [3%]), fall (n=3 [3%]), and sepsis (n=3 [3%]). Pneumonia (n=5 [5%]) and lower respiratory tract infection (n=4 [4%]) were considered treatment related. One treatment-related death\nwas reported (intracranial hematoma). INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence that acalabrutinib is active as single-agent therapy with a manageable safety profile in patients with treatment-naive, or relapse or refractory Waldenstrom\nmacroglobulinemia. Further studies are needed to establish its efficacy against current standard treatments and to investigate whether outcomes can be improved with combination therapies.

Fenfluramine has been reported to have antiseizure activity in observational studies of\nphotosensitive epilepsy and Dravet syndrome. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of fenfluramine in patients with Dravet syndrome. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled clinical trial, we enrolled children and young adults with Dravet syndrome. After a 6-week observation period to establish baseline monthly convulsive seizure frequency (MCSF; convulsive seizures were defined as\nhemiclonic, tonic, clonic, tonic-atonic, generalised tonic-clonic, and focal with clearly observable motor signs), patients were randomly assigned through an interactive web response system in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, fenfluramine\n0.2 mg/kg per day, or fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg per day, added to existing antiepileptic agents for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in mean monthly frequency of convulsive\nseizures during the treatment period compared with baseline in the 0.7 mg/kg per day group versus placebo; 0.2 mg/kg per day versus placebo was assessed as a key secondary outcome.\nAnalysis was by modified intention to treat. Safety analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with two identical\nprotocols NCT02682927 and NCT02826863. FINDINGS: Between Jan 15, 2016, and Aug 14, 2017, we assessed 173 patients, of whom 119 patients (mean age 9.0 years, 64 [54%] male) were randomly\nassigned to receive either fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg per day (39), fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg per day (40) or placebo (40). During treatment, the median reduction in seizure frequency was 74.9% in\nthe fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg group (from median 20.7 seizures per 28 days to 4.7 seizures per 28 days), 42.3% in the fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg group (from median 17.5 seizures per\n28 days to 12.6 per 28 days), and 19.2% in the placebo group (from median 27.3 per 28 days to 22.0 per 28 days). The study met its primary efficacy\nendpoint, with fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg per day showing a 62.3% greater reduction in mean MCSF compared with placebo (95% CI 47.7-72.8, p<0.0001); fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg per day showed a 32.4%\nreduction in mean MCSF compared with placebo (95% CI 6.2-52.3, p=0.0209). The most common adverse events (occurring in at least 10% of patients and more frequently in the fenfluramine groups)\nwere decreased appetite, diarrhoea, fatigue, lethargy, somnolence, and decreased weight. Echocardiographic examinations revealed valve function within the normal physiological range in all patients during the trial and no signs of\npulmonary arterial hypertension. INTERPRETATION: In Dravet syndrome, fenfluramine provided significantly greater reduction in convulsive seizure frequency compared with placebo and was generally well tolerated, with no observed valvular heart disease\nor pulmonary arterial hypertension. Fenfluramine could be an important new treatment option for patients with Dravet syndrome.

However, through rapid\nglobal nutrition transition, an increasing proportion of individuals are exposed to different forms of malnutrition during the life course and have the double burden of malnutrition (DBM) directly. Long-lasting effects\nof malnutrition in early life can be attributed to interconnected biological pathways, involving imbalance of the gut microbiome, inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and impaired insulin signalling. Life-course exposure to early undernutrition\nfollowed by later overweight increases the risk of non-communicable disease, by imposing a high metabolic load on a depleted capacity for homoeostasis, and in women increases the risk of childbirth\ncomplications. These life-course trajectories are shaped both by societal driving factors-ie, rapidly changing diets, norms of eating, and physical activity patterns-and by broader ecological factors such as pathogen burden and\nextrinsic mortality risk. Mitigation of the DBM will require major societal shifts regarding nutrition and public health, to implement comprehensive change that is sustained over decades, and scaled up into\nthe entire global food system.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31852605", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31852603", "Title": "Double-duty actions: seizing programme and policy opportunities to address malnutrition in all its forms.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/01/30 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 11", "Abstract": "Actions to address different forms of malnutrition are typically managed by separate communities, policies, programmes, governance structures, and funding streams. By contrast, double-duty actions, which aim to simultaneously tackle both\nundernutrition and problems of overweight, obesity, and diet-related non-communicable diseases (DR-NCDs) have been proposed as a way to effectively address malnutrition in all its forms in a more holisitic way.\nThis Series paper identifies ten double-duty actions that have strong potential to reduce the risk of both undernutrition, obesity, and DR-NCDs. It does so by summarising evidence on common drivers\nof different forms of malnutrition; documenting examples of unintended harm caused by some undernutrition-focused programmes on obesity and DR-NCDs; and highlighting examples of double-duty actions to tackle multiple forms of\nmalnutrition. We find that undernutrition, obesity, and DR-NCDs are intrinsically linked through early-life nutrition, diet diversity, food environments, and socioeconomic factors. Some evidence shows that programmes focused on undernutrition have\nraised risks of poor quality diets, obesity, and DR-NCDs, especially in countries undergoing a rapid nutrition transition. This Series paper builds on this evidence to develop a framework to guide\nthe design of double-duty approaches and strategies, and defines the first steps needed to deliver them.

Indonesia is the largest country with a severe DBM, but many other Asian and sub-Saharan African countries also face this problem. We also discuss that overweight increases\nare mainly due to very rapid changes in the food system, particularly the availability of cheap ultra-processed food and beverages in LMICs, and major reductions in physical activity at work,\ntransportation, home, and even leisure due to introductions of activity-saving technologies.

In this Series, the double burden of malnutrition (DBM) encompasses\nundernutrition in the form of stunting, and overweight and obesity. Health effects of the DBM include those associated with both undernutrition, such as impaired childhood development and greater susceptibility to\ninfectious diseases, and overweight, especially in terms of increased risk of added visceral fat and increased risk of non-communicable diseases. These health effects have not been translated into economic costs\nfor individuals and economies in the form of lost wages and productivity, as well as higher medical expenses. We summarise the existing approaches to modelling the economic effects of malnutrition\nand point out the weaknesses of these approaches for measuring economic losses from the DBM. Where population needs suggest that nutrition interventions take into account the DBM, economic evaluation can\nguide the choice of so-called double-duty interventions as an alternative to separate programming for stunting and overweight.

Here, we report blinded long-term follow-up results for the IBIS-II trial, which compared anastrozole with placebo, with the objective of determining the\nefficacy of anastrozole for preventing breast cancer (both invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ) in the post-treatment period. METHODS: IBIS-II is an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Postmenopausal women at\nincreased risk of developing breast cancer were recruited and were randomly assigned (1:1) to either anastrozole (1 mg per day, oral) or matching placebo daily for 5 years. After treatment\ncompletion, women were followed on a yearly basis to collect data on breast cancer incidence, death, other cancers, and major adverse events (cardiovascular events and fractures). The primary outcome was\nall breast cancer. FINDINGS: 3864 women were recruited between Feb 2, 2003, and Jan 31, 2012. 1920 women were randomly assigned to 5 years anastrozole and 1944 to placebo. After\na median follow-up of 131 months (IQR 105-156), a 49% reduction in breast cancer was observed for anastrozole (85 vs 165 cases, hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.39-0.66, p<0.0001).\nThe reduction was larger in the first 5 years (35 vs 89, 0.39, 0.27-0.58, p<0.0001), but still significant after 5 years (50 vs 76 new cases, 0.64, 0.45-0.91, p=0.014), and\nnot significantly different from the first 5 years (p=0.087). Invasive oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer was reduced by 54% (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33-0.65, p<0.0001), with a continued significant effect in\nthe period after treatment. A 59% reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ was observed (0.41, 0.22-0.79, p=0.0081), especially in participants known to be oestrogen receptor-positive (0.22, 0.78-0.65, p<0.0001). No significant\ndifference in deaths was observed overall (69 vs 70, HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.69-1.34, p=0.82) or for breast cancer (two anastrozole vs three placebo). A significant decrease in non-breast cancers\nwas observed for anastrozole (147 vs 200, odds ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.57-0.91, p=0.0042), owing primarily to non-melanoma skin cancer. No excess of fractures or cardiovascular disease was observed. INTERPRETATION:\nThis analysis has identified a significant continuing reduction in breast cancer with anastrozole in the post-treatment follow-up period, with no evidence of new late side-effects.

We therefore aimed to assess the activity of\nalisertib combined with 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: We did a single-arm, phase 2 trial of patients recruited from the\nDana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center in the USA. Eligible patients had previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and were at high risk of disease\nas defined by the presence of an adverse-risk karyotype, the presence of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia arising from previous myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasm, the presence of therapy-related acute myeloid\nleukaemia, or being 65 years or older. Enrolled patients received 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy of continuous infusion of cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-7) and intravenous bolus\nof idarubicin (12 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-3). Oral alisertib (30 mg) was given twice per day on days 8-15. Patients could receive up to four consolidation cycles with\ncytarabine and alisertib, and alisertib maintenance for 12 months. The primary endpoint was a composite including the proportion of patients achieving complete remission and those with a complete remission with\nincomplete neutrophil or platelet count recovery. Analyses were per-protocol. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02560025, and has completed enrolment. FINDINGS: Between Dec 31, 2015, and Aug 1, 2017,\nwe enrolled a total of 39 eligible patients. 19 (49%) of 39 patients had secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and three (8%) had therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia. At mid-induction, 33 (85%)\nof 39 patients showed marrow aplasia, six (15%) received re-induction. The median follow-up was 13.7 months (IQR 12.7-14.4). Composite remission was 64% (two-stage 95% CI 48-79), with 20 (51%) of\n39 patients achieving complete remission and five (13%) achieving complete remission with incomplete neutrophil or platelet count recovery. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events included febrile neutropenia\n(16 [41%] of 39), neutropenia (12 [31%]), thrombocytopenia (13 [33%]), anaemia (11 [28%]), anorexia (nine [23%]), and oral mucositis (four [10%]). No treatment-related deaths were observed.

At the primary analysis for progression-free survival\nof the phase 3 ALCYONE trial, progression-free survival was significantly longer with daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) versus bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (VMP) alone in patients\nwith transplant-ineligible, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Here we report updated efficacy and safety results from a prespecified, interim, overall survival analysis of ALCYONE with more than 36 months of follow-up.\nMETHODS: ALCYONE was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, phase 3 trial that enrolled patients between Feb 9, 2015, and July 14, 2016, at 162 sites in 25 countries across North\nAmerica, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation,\nbecause of their age (>/=65 years) or because of substantial comorbidities. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and by permuted block randomisation to receive D-VMP or VMP. An\ninteractive web-based randomisation system was used. Randomisation was stratified by International Staging System disease stage, geographical region, and age. There was no masking to treatment assignments. All patients received up\nto nine 6-week cycles of subcutaneous bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2) of body surface area on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 of cycle one and on days\n1, 8, 22, and 29 of cycles two through nine), oral melphalan (9 mg/m(2) once daily on days 1 through 4 of each cycle), and oral prednisone (60 mg/m(2) once\ndaily on days 1 through 4 of each cycle). Patients in the D-VMP group also received intravenous daratumumab (16 mg/kg of bodyweight, once weekly during cycle one, once every 3\nweeks in cycles two through nine, and once every 4 weeks thereafter as maintenance therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which has been\nreported previously. Results presented are from a prespecified interim analysis for overall survival. The primary analysis population (including for overall survival) was the intention-to-treat population of all patients who were\nrandomly assigned to treatment. The safety population included patients who received any dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02195479. FINDINGS: 706 patients were randomly assigned to\ntreatment groups (350 to the D-VMP group, 356 to the VMP group). At a median follow-up of 40.1 months (IQR 37.4-43.1), a significant benefit in overall survival was observed for\nthe D-VMP group. The hazard ratio (HR) for death in the D-VMP group compared with the VMP group was 0.60 (95% CI 0.46-0.80; p=0.0003). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 36-month\nrate of overall survival was 78.0% (95% CI 73.2-82.0) in the D-VMP group and 67.9% (62.6-72.6) in the VMP group. Progression-free survival, the primary endpoint, remained significantly improved for the\nD-VMP group (HR 0.42 [0.34-0.51]; p<0.0001). The most frequent adverse events during maintenance daratumumab monotherapy in patients in the D-VMP group were respiratory infections (54 [19%] of 278 patients had\nupper respiratory tract infections; 42 [15%] had bronchitis, 34 [12%] had viral upper respiratory tract infections), cough (34 [12%]), and diarrhoea (28 [10%]). INTERPRETATION: D-VMP prolonged overall survival in patients\nwith newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for stem-cell transplantation. With more than 3 years of follow-up, the D-VMP group continued to show significant improvement in progression-free survival, with\nno new safety concerns.

METHODS: We did a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised trial at 22 centres in the UK. Individuals aged\n6-40 years with clinically confirmed Marfan syndrome were eligible for inclusion. Study participants were all given 75 mg open label irbesartan once daily, then randomly assigned to 150 mg of\nirbesartan (increased to 300 mg as tolerated) or matching placebo. Aortic diameter was measured by echocardiography at baseline and then annually. All images were analysed by a core laboratory blinded\nto treatment allocation.

FINDINGS: Between March 14, 2012, and May 1, 2015,\n192 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to irbesartan (n=104) or placebo (n=88), and all were followed for up to 5 years.

Mean baseline aortic root diameter was 34.4\nmm in the irbesartan group (SD 5.8) and placebo group (5.5). The mean rate of aortic root dilatation was 0.53 mm per year (95% CI 0.39 to 0.67) in the\nirbesartan group compared with 0.74 mm per year (0.60 to 0.89) in the placebo group, with a difference in means of -0.22 mm per year (-0.41 to -0.02, p=0.030). The\nrate of change in aortic Z score was also reduced by irbesartan (difference in means -0.10 per year, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.01, p=0.035). Irbesartan was well tolerated with no\nobserved differences in rates of serious adverse events.

Although increases in glacier flow(4-6)\nand surface melting(7-9) have been driven by oceanic(10-12) and atmospheric(13,14) warming, the magnitude and trajectory of the ice sheet's mass imbalance remain uncertain. Here we compare and combine 26 individual\nsatellite measurements of changes in the ice sheet's volume, flow and gravitational potential to produce a reconciled estimate of its mass balance. The ice sheet was close to a state\nof balance in the 1990s, but annual losses have risen since then, peaking at 345 +/- 66 billion tonnes per year in 2011. In all, Greenland lost 3,902 +/- 342\nbillion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2018, causing the mean sea level to rise by 10.8 +/- 0.9 millimetres. Using three regional climate models, we show that the reduced\nsurface mass balance has driven 1,964 +/- 565 billion tonnes (50.3 per cent) of the ice loss owing to increased meltwater runoff. The remaining 1,938 +/- 541 billion tonnes (49.7\nper cent) of ice loss was due to increased glacier dynamical imbalance, which rose from 46 +/- 37 billion tonnes per year in the 1990s to 87 +/- 25 billion\ntonnes per year since then. The total rate of ice loss slowed to 222 +/- 30 billion tonnes per year between 2013 and 2017, on average, as atmospheric circulation favoured\ncooler conditions(15) and ocean temperatures fell at the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbrae(16). Cumulative ice losses from Greenland as a whole have been close to the rates predicted by the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change for their high-end climate warming scenario(17), which forecast an additional 70 to 130 millimetres of global sea-level rise by 2100 compared with their central estimate.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822019", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31819249", "Title": "Fighting fire with science.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/15 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Dec", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31819249", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31818492", "Title": "My arrest in support of Extinction Rebellion: the imperative for action.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/14 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 25", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31818492", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31818491", "Title": "Should health professionals participate in civil disobedience in response to the climate change health emergency?", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/02/14 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 25", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31818491", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31813637", "Title": "Ixekizumab for patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (COAST-X): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial.", "JournalName": "Lancet (London, England)", "Creation Date": "2020/01/30 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Jan 4", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ixekizumab, a high-affinity interleukin-17A (IL-17A) monoclonal antibody, has previously shown efficacy in radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (also known as ankylosing spondylitis).

METHODS: COAST-X was a 52-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study done at 107 sites\nin 15 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America. Eligible participants were adults (aged >/=18 years) with active axial spondyloarthritis without definite radiographic sacroiliitis (non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis), objective\nsigns of inflammation (via MRI or C-reactive protein), and an inadequate response or intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous 80 mg ixekizumab\nevery 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 2 weeks (Q2W), or placebo.

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the ixekizumab groups were nasopharyngitis and injection site\nreaction. Of the treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest, there was one case of serious infection in the ixekizumab Q4W group. The frequency of serious adverse events was low (four\n[1%] of 302) and similar across the three groups. There were no malignancies or deaths. No new safety signals were identified.

Only with comprehensive food and alcohol strategies based on fiscal and regulatory measures (including a minimum unit price for alcohol,\nthe alcohol duty escalator, and an extension of the sugar levy on food content) can the disease burden be curtailed. Following introduction of minimum unit pricing in Scotland, alcohol sales\nfell by 3%, with the greatest effect on heavy drinkers of low-cost alcohol products. We also discuss the major contribution of obesity and alcohol to the ten most common cancers\nas well as measures outlined by the departing Chief Medical Officer to combat rising levels of obesity-the highest of any country in the west. Mortality of severely ill patients with\nliver disease in district general hospitals is unacceptably high, indicating the need to develop a masterplan for improving hospital care. We propose a plan based around specialist hospital centres that\nare linked to district general hospitals by operational delivery networks. This plan has received strong backing from the British Association for Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology,\nbut is held up at NHS England. The value of so-called day-case care bundles to reduce high hospital readmission rates with greater care in the community is described, along with\nexamples of locally derived schemes for the early detection of disease and, in particular, schemes to allow general practitioners to refer patients directly for elastography assessment. New funding arrangements for\ngeneral practitioners will be required if these proposals are to be taken up more widely around the country. Understanding of the harm to health from lifestyle causes among the general\npopulation is low, with a poor knowledge of alcohol consumption and dietary guidelines. The Lancet Commission has serious doubts about whether the initiatives described in the Prevention Green Paper, with\nthe onus placed on the individual based on the use of information technology and the latest in behavioural science, will be effective.

The factors that place individuals and populations at increased risk of involuntary hospitalisation are unclear, and evidence is\nneeded to understand these disparities and inform development of interventions to reduce involuntary hospitalisation. We did a systematic review, meta-analysis, and narrative synthesis to investigate risk factors at the patient,\nservice, and area level associated with involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation of adults. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Register of Trials from Jan 1, 1983, to\nAug 14, 2019, for studies comparing the characteristics of voluntary and involuntary psychiatric inpatients, and studies investigating the characteristics of involuntarily hospitalised individuals in general population samples. We synthesised results\nusing random effects meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. Our review follows Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42018095103. FINDINGS: 77 studies were included\nfrom 22 countries. Involuntary rather than voluntary hospitalisation was associated with male gender (odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.14-1.32; p<0.0001), single marital status (1.47, 1.18-1.83; p<0.0001), unemployment (1.43, 1.07-1.90; p=0.020),\nreceiving welfare benefits (1.71, 1.28-2.27; p<0.0001), being diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (2.18, 1.95-2.44; p<0.0001) or bipolar disorder (1.48, 1.24-1.76; p<0.0001), and previous involuntary hospitalisation (2.17, 1.62-2.91; p<0.0001). Using narrative\nsynthesis, we found associations between involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation and perceived risk to others, positive symptoms of psychosis, reduced insight into illness, reduced adherence to treatment before hospitalisation, and police involvement\nin admission. On a population level, some evidence was noted of a positive dose-response relation between area deprivation and involuntary hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: Previous involuntary hospitalisation and diagnosis of a psychotic\ndisorder were factors associated with the greatest risk of involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation. People with these risk factors represent an important target group for preventive interventions, such as crisis planning. Economic\ndeprivation on an individual level and at the population level was associated with increased risk for involuntary hospitalisation. Mechanisms underpinning the risk factors could not be identified using the available\nevidence.

For decades, treatment of malaria has relied on chloroquine (CQ), a safe and affordable\n4-aminoquinoline that was highly effective against intra-erythrocytic asexual blood-stage parasites, until resistance arose in Southeast Asia and South America and spread worldwide(1). Clinical resistance to the chemically related current first-line\ncombination drug piperaquine (PPQ) has now emerged regionally, reducing its efficacy(2). Resistance to CQ and PPQ has been associated with distinct sets of point mutations in the P. falciparum CQ-resistance\ntransporter PfCRT, a 49-kDa member of the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily that traverses the membrane of the acidic digestive vacuole of the parasite(3-9). Here we present the structure, at 3.2 A\nresolution, of the PfCRT isoform of CQ-resistant, PPQ-sensitive South American 7G8 parasites, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and antigen-binding fragment technology. Mutations that contribute to CQ and PPQ resistance localize primarily\nto moderately conserved sites on distinct helices that line a central negatively charged cavity, indicating that this cavity is the principal site of interaction with the positively charged CQ and\nPPQ. Binding and transport studies reveal that the 7G8 isoform binds both drugs with comparable affinities, and that these drugs are mutually competitive. The 7G8 isoform transports CQ in a\nmembrane potential- and pH-dependent manner, consistent with an active efflux mechanism that drives CQ resistance(5), but does not transport PPQ. Functional studies on the newly emerging PfCRT F145I and C350R\nmutations, associated with decreased PPQ susceptibility in Asia and South America, respectively(6,9), reveal their ability to mediate PPQ transport in 7G8 variant proteins and to confer resistance in gene-edited parasites.\nStructural, functional and in silico analyses suggest that distinct mechanistic features mediate the resistance to CQ and PPQ in PfCRT variants.

The isoalloLCA-mediated enhancement of Treg cell differentiation required an intronic Foxp3 enhancer, the conserved noncoding sequence (CNS) 3; this represents\na mode of action distinct from that of previously identified metabolites that increase Treg cell differentiation, which require CNS1.

Here we examine the dynamics of chromosome reorganization by Hi-C after mitosis in highly purified, synchronous mouse erythroid cell populations. We observed\nrapid establishment of A/B compartments, followed by their gradual intensification and expansion. Contact domains form from the 'bottom up'-smaller subTADs are formed initially, followed by convergence into multi-domain TAD structures.\nCTCF is partially retained on mitotic chromosomes and immediately resumes full binding in ana/telophase. By contrast, cohesin is completely evicted from mitotic chromosomes and regains focal binding at a slower\nrate. The formation of CTCF/cohesin co-anchored structural loops follows the kinetics of cohesin positioning. Stripe-shaped contact patterns-anchored by CTCF-grow in length, which is consistent with a loop-extrusion process after mitosis.\nInteractions between cis-regulatory elements can form rapidly, with rates exceeding those of CTCF/cohesin-anchored contacts. Notably, we identified a group of rapidly emerging transient contacts between cis-regulatory elements in ana/telophase that\nare dissolved upon G1 entry, co-incident with the establishment of inner boundaries or nearby interfering chromatin loops.

Much research examining abortion and mental health has relied on self-report, has had low participation\nrates, and did not consider confounding factors. In the present study, we used data that do not rely on self-report and are not affected by low participation rates to examine\nthe association between abortion and non-fatal suicide attempts, adjusting for confounding factors. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study of Danish population registries, we linked data on a cohort of women\nborn in Denmark between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 30, 1998, who did not die or emigrate from Denmark before their 18th birthday or before study entry. Follow-up started on\nthe woman's 18th birthday or Jan 1, 2000, whichever came last. Follow-up ended at the date of first suicide attempt, date of emigration from Denmark, date of death, or Dec\n31, 2016, whichever came first. Women were between the ages of 18 and 36 years during the study period. We used a survival analysis to examine the risk of first\nsuicide attempts or self-harm associated with a first abortion compared with no abortion, in the complete study cohort. To examine incidence rate ratios (IRRs) associated with abortion, we used Poisson\nregression with the logarithm of woman-years at risk as an offset. We also examined whether the risk of suicide attempts changed before and after the abortion, adjusting for age, calendar\nyear, socioeconomic status, and history of childbirth, mental health, parental mental health, and physical health. FINDINGS: Data on 523 280 women were included in this study. Of these, 48 990\n(9.4%) women had a record of at least one first-trimester abortion, and 10 216 (2.0%) had a suicide attempt during the study period. Among 48 990 women who had an\nabortion, 1402 (2.9%) had a first suicide attempt after the first abortion. In our fully-adjusted model which adjusted for all covariates, the risk of first-time non-fatal suicide attempts was similar\nin the year before an abortion (IRR 2.46 [95% CI 2.22-2.72]) and the year after an abortion (IRR 2.54 [2.29-2.81], p=0.509) compared with women who had not had an abortion,\nand decreased with increasing time since the abortion (1-5 years IRR 1.90 [1.75-2.06]; >/=5 years IRR 1.73 [1.53-1.96]). INTERPRETATION: We found that women who had abortions had a higher risk\nof non-fatal suicide attempts compared with women who did not have an abortion. However, because the increased risk was the same both the year before and after the abortion, it\nis not attributable to the abortion. Thus, policies based on the notion that abortion increases women's risk of suicide attempts are misinformed.

Each compass neuron receives inputs from 'ring' neurons that are selective for\nparticular visual features(13-16); this combination provides an ideal substrate for the extraction of directional information from a visual scene. Here we combine two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics in tethered flying\nflies with circuit modelling, and show how the correlated activity of compass and visual neurons drives plasticity(17-22), which flexibly transforms two-dimensional visual cues into a stable heading representation.

In the absence of visual cues, the compass neuron network\nestimates heading by integrating self-movement signals over time(3,4). When a visual cue is present, the estimate of the network is more accurate(1,3). Visual inputs to compass neurons are thought to\noriginate from inhibitory neurons called R neurons (also known as ring neurons); the receptive fields of R neurons tile visual space(5). The axon of each R neuron overlaps with the\ndendrites of every compass neuron(6), raising the question of how visual cues are integrated into the compass. Here, using in vivo whole-cell recordings, we show that a visual cue can\nevoke synaptic inhibition in compass neurons and that R neurons mediate this inhibition. Each compass neuron is inhibited only by specific visual cue positions, indicating that many potential connections from\nR neurons onto compass neurons are actually weak or silent. We also show that the pattern of visually evoked inhibition can reorganize over minutes as the fly explores an altered\nvirtual-reality environment. Using ensemble calcium imaging, we demonstrate that this reorganization causes persistent changes in the compass coordinate frame. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which correlated pre-\nand postsynaptic activity triggers associative long-term synaptic depression of visually evoked inhibition in compass neurons. Our findings provide evidence for the theoretical proposal that associative plasticity of sensory inputs, when\ncombined with attractor dynamics, can reconcile self-movement information with changing external cues to generate a coherent sense of direction(7-12).", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31748749", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31748741", "Title": "PGRMC2 is an intracellular haem chaperone critical for adipocyte function.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/27 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Dec", "Abstract": "Haem is an essential prosthetic group of numerous proteins and a central signalling molecule in many physiologic processes(1,2).

Recent policies have focused on primary prevention of mental disorders in children and young people, with schools\nat the forefront of implementation.

METHODS: We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis, searching MEDLINE, Embase,\nPsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials for published and unpublished, passive and active-controlled randomised and quasi-randomised trials. We included educational setting-based, universal, or targeted interventions in which the\nprimary aim was the prevention of anxiety and depression in children and young people aged 4-18 years. Primary outcomes were post-intervention self-report anxiety and depression, wellbeing, suicidal ideation, or self-harm.\nWe assessed risk of bias following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

In universal secondary settings, mindfulness and relaxation-based interventions showed a reduction in anxiety symptoms relative to usual curriculum (SMD -0.65, 95% credible interval -1.14\nto -0.19). There was a lack of evidence to support any one type of intervention being effective to prevent depression in universal or targeted primary or secondary settings.

We compared the risk of suicide following hospital presentation for self-harm according to patient characteristics, method\nof self-harm, and variations in area-level socioeconomic deprivation, and estimated the incidence of suicide by time after hospital attendance. METHODS: In this ongoing Multicentre Study of Self-harm in England, the\nstudy population consists of individuals aged at least 15 years who had attended the emergency department of five general hospitals in Oxford, Manchester, and Derby after non-fatal self-harm between Jan\n1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2013. Information on method of self-harm was obtained through systematic monitoring in hospitals. Level of socioeconomic deprivation was based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation\n(IMD) characterising the area where patients lived, grouping them according to IMD quintiles. Mortality follow-up was up to Dec 31, 2015, resulting in up to 16 years of follow-up. We\ncalculated incidence of suicide since first hospital presentation by follow-up period and estimated the association between individual factors (age, gender, method of self-harm, IMD, and number of non-fatal self-harm presentations\nto hospital) and suicide using mixed-effect models. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2013, there were 92 177 presentations to the study hospitals by 51 108 individuals. 1325\npatients involved in 1563 self-harm episodes were excluded from the study because they had missing information on gender, age, or mortality. The resulting study sample consisted of 90 614 hospital\npresentations by 49 783 individuals. By the end of follow-up on Dec 31, 2015, 703 patients had died by suicide. The overall incidence of suicide was 163.1 (95% CI 151.5-175.6)\nper 100 000 person-years, and 260.0 (237.4-284.8) per 100 000 person-years in men and 94.6 (83.3-107.4) per 100 000 person-years in women. The incidence of suicide was highest in the\nyear following discharge from hospital (511.1 [451.7-578.2] per 100 000 person-years), particularly in the first month (1787.1 [1423.0-2244.4] per 100 000 person-years). Based on all presentations to hospital, men were\nthree times more likely than women to die by suicide after self-harm (OR 3.36 [95% CI 2.77-4.08], p<0.0001). Age was positively related to suicide risk in both genders, with a\n3% increase in risk for every one-year increase in age at hospital presentation (OR 1.03 [1.03-1.04], p<0.0001). Relative to hospital presentations after self-poisoning alone, presentations involving both self-injury and self-poisoning\nwere associated with higher suicide risk (adjusted OR 2.06 [95% CI 1.42-2.99], p<0.0001], as were presentations after self-injury alone (adjusted OR 1.36 [1.09-1.70], p=0.007). Similarly, relative to self-harm by self-poisoning\nalone, attempted hanging or asphyxiation (adjusted OR 2.70 [1.53-4.78], p=0.001) and traffic-related acts of self-injury (adjusted OR 2.99 [1.17-7.65], p=0.022) were associated with greater risk of suicide. Self-cutting combined with\nself-poisoning was also associated with increased suicide risk (adjusted OR 1.36, [1.08-1.71], p=0.01). Compared with those patients living in the most deprived areas, those who lived in the least deprived\nareas (first national IMD quintile) had a greater risk of dying by suicide (adjusted OR 1.76 [1.32-2.34], p<0.0001) after adjusting for gender, age, previous self-harm, and psychiatric treatment, as did\nthose living in the second least deprived areas (adjusted OR 1.64 [1.20-2.25], p=0.002). INTERPRETATION: Patients attending hospital for self-harm are at high risk of suicide, especially immediately after hospital attendance.\nCertain patient characteristics and methods of self-harm, together with living in areas of low socioeconomic deprivation, can increase patients' subsequent suicide risk. However, while specific risk factors can be usefully\nintegrated into the assessment process, individual factors have poor utility in predicting suicide, so the needs and risks of all patients should be assessed to develop appropriate aftercare plan, including\nearly follow-up.

However, the use of cord blood is rapidly declining because of the high incidence\nof infections, severe acute GVHD, and transplant-related mortality. UM171, a haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal agonist, has been shown to expand cord blood stem cells and enhance multilineage blood cell reconstitution\nin mice. We aimed to investigate the safety and feasibility of single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation in patients with haematological malignancies who do not have a suitable HLA-matched donor. METHODS:\nThis single-arm, open-label, phase 1-2 safety and feasibility study was done at two hospitals in Canada. The study had two parts. In part 1, patients received two cord blood units\n(one expanded with UM171 and one unmanipulated cord blood) until UM171-expanded cord blood demonstrated engraftment. Once engraftment was documented we initiated part 2, reported here, in which patients received a\nsingle UM171-expanded cord blood unit with a dose de-escalation design to determine the minimal cord blood unit cell dose that achieved prompt engraftment. Eligible patients were aged 3-64 years, weighed\n12 kg or more, had a haematological malignancy with an indication for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and did not have a suitable HLA-matched donor, and a had a Karnofsky\nperformance status score of 70% or more. Five clinical sites were planned to participate in the study; however, only two study sites opened, both of which only treated adult patients,\nthus no paediatric patients (aged <18 years) were recruited. Patients aged younger than 50 years without comorbidities received a myeloablative conditioning regimen (cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, fludarabine 75 mg/m(2), and 12\nGy total body irradiation) and patients aged older than 50 years and those with comorbidities received a less myeloablative conditioning regimen (cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg, thiotepa 10 mg/kg, fludarabine 150 mg/m(2),\nand 4 Gy total body irradiation). Patients were infused with the 7-day UM171-expanded CD34-positive cells and the lymphocyte-containing CD34-negative fraction. The primary endpoints were feasibility of UM171 expansion, safety of\nthe transplant, kinetics of hematopoietic reconstitution (time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment) of UM171-expanded cord blood, and minimal pre-expansion cord blood unit cell dose that achieved prompt engraftment. We analysed\nfeasibility in all enrolled patients and all other primary outcomes were analysed per protocol, in all patients who received single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation. This trial has been completed and\nwas registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02668315. FINDINGS: Between Feb 17, 2016, and Nov 11, 2018, we enrolled 27 patients, four of whom received two cord blood units for safety purposes in\npart 1 of the study. 23 patients were subsequently enrolled in part 2 to receive a single UM171-expanded cord blood transplant and 22 patients received a single UM171-expanded cord blood\ntransplantation. At data cutoff (Dec 31, 2018), median follow-up was 18 months (IQR 12-22). The minimal cord blood unit cell dose at thaw that achieved prompt engraftment as a single\ncord transplant after UM171 expansion was 0.52 x 10(5) CD34-positive cells. We successfully expanded 26 (96%) of 27 cord blood units with UM171. Among the 22 patients who received single\nUM171-expanded cord blood transplantation, median time to engraftment of 100 neutrophils per muL was 9.5 days (IQR 8-12), median time to engraftment of 500 neutrophils per muL was 18 days\n(12.5-20.0), and no graft failure occurred. Median time to platelet recovery was 42 days (IQR 35-47). The most common non-haematological adverse events were grade 3 febrile neutropenia (16 [73%] of\n22 patients) and bacteraemia (nine [41%]). No unexpected adverse events were observed. One (5%) of 22 patients died due to treatment-related diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. INTERPRETATION: Our preliminary findings suggest that\nUM171 cord blood stem cell expansion is feasible, safe, and allows for the use of small single cords without compromising engraftment. UM171-expanded cord blood might have the potential to overcome\nthe disadvantages of other cord blood transplants while maintaining the benefits of low risk of chronic GVHD and relapse, and warrants further investigation in randomised trials.

We analysed the available evidence to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of all types of medicinal cannabinoids in treating symptoms of various mental disorders. METHODS: For this systematic\nreview and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies published between Jan 1, 1980,\nand April 30, 2018. We also searched for unpublished or ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. We considered\nall studies examining any type and formulation of a medicinal cannabinoid in adults (>/=18 years) for treating depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis,\neither as the primary condition or secondary to other medical conditions. We placed no restrictions on language, publication status, or study type (ie, both experimental and observational study designs were\nincluded). Primary outcomes were remission from and changes in symptoms of these mental disorders. The safety of medicinal cannabinoids for these mental disorders was also examined. Evidence from randomised controlled\ntrials was synthesised as odds ratios (ORs) for disorder remission, adverse events, and withdrawals and as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of\nthe evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059372, CRD42017059373, CRD42017059376,\nCRD42017064996, and CRD42018102977). FINDINGS: 83 eligible studies (40 randomised controlled trials, n=3067) were included: 42 for depression (23 randomised controlled trials; n=2551), 31 for anxiety (17 randomised controlled trials; n=605),\neight for Tourette syndrome (two randomised controlled trials; n=36), three for ADHD (one randomised controlled trial; n=30), 12 for post-traumatic stress disorder (one randomised controlled trial; n=10), and 11 for\npsychosis (six randomised controlled trials; n=281). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) improved anxiety symptoms among individuals with other medical conditions (primarily chronic non-cancer pain and multiple sclerosis; SMD -0.25\n[95% CI -0.49 to -0.01]; seven studies; n=252), although the evidence GRADE was very low. Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) worsened negative symptoms of psychosis in a single study\n(SMD 0.36 [95% CI 0.10 to 0.62]; n=24). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) did not significantly affect any other primary outcomes for the mental disorders examined but did increase\nthe number of people who had adverse events (OR 1.99 [95% CI 1.20 to 3.29]; ten studies; n=1495) and withdrawals due to adverse events (2.78 [1.59 to 4.86]; 11 studies;\nn=1621) compared with placebo across all mental disorders examined. Few randomised controlled trials examined the role of pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis. INTERPRETATION: There is scarce evidence to suggest that\ncannabinoids improve depressive disorders and symptoms, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. There is very low quality evidence that pharmaceutical THC (with or without\nCBD) leads to a small improvement in symptoms of anxiety among individuals with other medical conditions. There remains insufficient evidence to provide guidance on the use of cannabinoids for treating\nmental disorders within a regulatory framework. Further high-quality studies directly examining the effect of cannabinoids on treating mental disorders are needed.

Moreover, it remains unclear which land-use types and arthropod groups\nare affected, and whether the observed declines in biomass and diversity are linked to one another. Here we analyse data from more than 1 million individual arthropods (about 2,700 species),\nfrom standardized inventories taken between 2008 and 2017 at 150 grassland and 140 forest sites in 3 regions of Germany. Overall gamma diversity in grasslands and forests decreased over time,\nindicating loss of species across sites and regions. In annually sampled grasslands, biomass, abundance and number of species declined by 67%, 78% and 34%, respectively. The decline was consistent across\ntrophic levels and mainly affected rare species; its magnitude was independent of local land-use intensity. However, sites embedded in landscapes with a higher cover of agricultural land showed a stronger\ntemporal decline. In 30 forest sites with annual inventories, biomass and species number-but not abundance-decreased by 41% and 36%, respectively. This was supported by analyses of all forest sites sampled\nin three-year intervals. The decline affected rare and abundant species, and trends differed across trophic levels. Our results show that there are widespread declines in arthropod biomass, abundance and the\nnumber of species across trophic levels. Arthropod declines in forests demonstrate that loss is not restricted to open habitats. Our results suggest that major drivers of arthropod decline act at\nlarger spatial scales, and are (at least for grasslands) associated with agriculture at the landscape level.

Furthermore, longevity is dynamically regulated by the excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural circuits. The transcription factor REST is upregulated in humans with extended longevity and represses excitation-related\ngenes.

Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans REST orthologue genes spr-3 and spr-4 elevate neural excitation and\nreduce the lifespan of long-lived daf-2 mutants.

It enables heritable gene repression, maintains chromosome integrity and provides mechanical rigidity to the nucleus(1,2). These diverse functions are proposed to arise in\npart from compaction of the underlying chromatin(2). A major type of heterochromatin contains at its core the complex formed between HP1 proteins and chromatin that is methylated on histone H3,\nlysine 9 (H3K9me). HP1 is proposed to use oligomerization to compact chromatin into phase-separated condensates(3-6). Yet, how HP1-mediated phase separation relates to chromatin compaction remains unclear. Here we show that\nchromatin compaction by the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HP1 protein Swi6 results in phase-separated liquid condensates. Unexpectedly, we find that Swi6 substantially increases the accessibility and dynamics of buried histone residues within\na nucleosome. Restraining these dynamics impairs compaction of chromatin into liquid droplets by Swi6. Our results indicate that Swi6 couples its oligomerization to the phase separation of chromatin by a\ncounterintuitive mechanism, namely the dynamic exposure of buried nucleosomal regions. We propose that such reshaping of the octamer core by Swi6 increases opportunities for multivalent interactions between nucleosomes, thereby promoting\nphase separation. This mechanism may more generally drive chromatin organization beyond heterochromatin.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618757", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31616104", "Title": "Boosting inclusivity in the Nobels.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Oct", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616104", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31616103", "Title": "Small island states excluded from climate research when they need it most.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Oct", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616103", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31616102", "Title": "Why Japan imported Ebola ahead of the 2020 Olympics.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Oct", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616102", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31616098", "Title": "Geneticists retract study suggesting first CRISPR babies might die early.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Oct", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616098", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31616095", "Title": "Africa - first institute for neuroscience.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Oct", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616095", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31616094", "Title": "Ecuador's research dream crushed by politics.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Oct", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616094", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31616093", "Title": "Data - from objects to assets.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/28 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Oct", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616093", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31610543", "Title": "Widespread global increase in intense lake phytoplankton blooms since the 1980s.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/28 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Oct", "Abstract": "Freshwater blooms of phytoplankton affect public health and ecosystem services globally(1,2).

Freshwater blooms result in economic losses of more than US$4 billion annually in the United States alone, primarily from harm to aquatic food production, recreation and tourism,\nand drinking-water supplies(3). Studies that document bloom conditions in lakes have either focused only on individual or regional subsets of lakes(4-6), or have been limited by a lack of long-term\nobservations(7-9). Here we use three decades of high-resolution Landsat 5 satellite imagery to investigate long-term trends in intense summertime near-surface phytoplankton blooms for 71 large lakes globally. We find that\npeak summertime bloom intensity has increased in most (68 per cent) of the lakes studied, revealing a global exacerbation of bloom conditions. Lakes that have experienced a significant (P <\n0.1) decrease in bloom intensity are rare (8 per cent). The reason behind the increase in phytoplankton bloom intensity remains unclear, however, as temporal trends do not track consistently with\ntemperature, precipitation, fertilizer-use trends or other previously hypothesized drivers. We do find, however, that lakes with a decrease in bloom intensity warmed less compared to other lakes, suggesting that lake\nwarming may already be counteracting management efforts to ameliorate eutrophication(10,11).

Hundreds of drivers in coding genes are known but, to date, only a handful of noncoding drivers have been discovered-despite intensive\nsearching(1,2). Attention has recently shifted to the role of altered RNA splicing in cancer; driver mutations that lead to transcriptome-wide aberrant splicing have been identified in multiple types of cancer,\nalthough these mutations have only been found in protein-coding splicing factors such as splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1)(3-6). By contrast, cancer-related alterations in the noncoding component of the spliceosome-a\nseries of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)-have barely been studied, owing to the combined challenges of characterizing noncoding cancer drivers and the repetitive nature of snRNA genes(1,7,8). Here we report a\nhighly recurrent A>C somatic mutation at the third base of U1 snRNA in several types of tumour. The primary function of U1 snRNA is to recognize the 5' splice site\nvia base-pairing. This mutation changes the preferential A-U base-pairing between U1 snRNA and the 5' splice site to C-G base-pairing, and thus creates novel splice junctions and alters the splicing\npattern of multiple genes-including known drivers of cancer. Clinically, the A>C mutation is associated with heavy alcohol use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and with the aggressive subtype of chronic\nlymphocytic leukaemia with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable regions. The mutation in U1 snRNA also independently confers an adverse prognosis to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Our study demonstrates a noncoding\ndriver in spliceosomal RNAs, reveals a mechanism of aberrant splicing in cancer and may represent a new target for treatment.

Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a membrane-embedded core complex of\nthe ESX-3/type VII secretion system from Mycobacterium smegmatis. The core of the ESX-3 secretion machine consists of four protein components-EccB3, EccC3, EccD3 and EccE3, in a 1:1:2:1 stoichiometry-which form two\nidentical protomers. The EccC3 coupling protein comprises a flexible array of four ATPase domains, which are linked to the membrane through a stalk domain. The domain of unknown function (DUF)\nadjacent to the stalk is identified as an ATPase domain that is essential for secretion. EccB3 is predominantly periplasmatic, but a small segment crosses the membrane and contacts the stalk\ndomain. This suggests that conformational changes in the stalk domain-triggered by substrate binding at the distal end of EccC3 and subsequent ATP hydrolysis in the DUF-could be coupled to substrate\nsecretion to the periplasm.

Atmospheric\naerosols can cool the climate, masking some of the warming effect that results from the emission of greenhouse gases(1). However, aerosol particulates are highly toxic when inhaled, leading to millions\nof premature deaths per year(2,3). The phasing out of unabated fossil-fuel combustion will therefore provide health benefits, but will also reduce the extent to which the warming induced by greenhouse\ngases is masked by aerosols. Because aerosol levels respond much more rapidly to changes in emissions relative to carbon dioxide, large near-term increases in the magnitude and rate of climate\nwarming are predicted in many idealized studies that typically assume an instantaneous removal of all anthropogenic or fossil-fuel-related emissions(1,4-9). Here we show that more realistic modelling scenarios do not produce\na substantial near-term increase in either the magnitude or the rate of warming, and in fact can lead to a decrease in warming rates within two decades of the start\nof the fossil-fuel phase-out. Accounting for the time required to transform power generation, industry and transportation leads to gradually increasing and largely offsetting climate impacts of carbon dioxide and sulfur\ndioxide, with the rate of warming further slowed by reductions in fossil-methane emissions.

However, the\norigin of these signals and the molecular mechanism of long-range signalling at an atomic level remain unclear(5-8). The different spatial scales and timescales in signalling pathways render experimental observation challenging;\nin particular, the positions and movement of mobile protons cannot be visualized by current methods of structural analysis. Here we report the experimental observation of fluctuating low-barrier hydrogen bonds as\nswitching elements in cooperativity pathways of multimeric enzymes. We have observed these low-barrier hydrogen bonds in ultra-high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of two multimeric enzymes, and have validated their assignment using\ncomputational calculations. Catalytic events at the active sites switch between low-barrier hydrogen bonds and ordinary hydrogen bonds in a circuit that consists of acidic side chains and water molecules, transmitting\na signal through the collective repositioning of protons by behaving as an atomistic Newton's cradle. The resulting communication synchronizes catalysis in the oligomer. Our studies provide several lines of evidence\nand a working model for not only the existence of low-barrier hydrogen bonds in proteins, but also a connection to enzyme cooperativity.

Wild-type p53 accumulates in response to cellular stress, and\nregulates gene expression to alter cell fate and prevent tumour development(2). Wild-type p53 is also known to modulate cellular metabolic pathways(3), although p53-dependent metabolic alterations that constrain cancer progression remain\npoorly understood. Here we find that p53 remodels cancer-cell metabolism to enforce changes in chromatin and gene expression that favour a premalignant cell fate. Restoring p53 function in cancer cells\nderived from KRAS-mutant mouse models of PDAC leads to the accumulation of alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG, also known as 2-oxoglutarate), a metabolite that also serves as an obligate substrate for a subset\nof chromatin-modifying enzymes. p53 induces transcriptional programs that are characteristic of premalignant differentiation, and this effect can be partially recapitulated by the addition of cell-permeable alphaKG. Increased levels of the\nalphaKG-dependent chromatin modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) accompany the tumour-cell differentiation that is triggered by p53, whereas decreased 5hmC characterizes the transition from premalignant to de-differentiated malignant lesions that is associated with\nmutations in Trp53. Enforcing the accumulation of alphaKG in p53-deficient PDAC cells through the inhibition of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase-an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle-specifically results in increased 5hmC, tumour-cell differentiation\nand decreased tumour-cell fitness. Conversely, increasing the intracellular levels of succinate (a competitive inhibitor of alphaKG-dependent dioxygenases) blunts p53-driven tumour suppression. These data suggest that alphaKG is an effector of\np53-mediated tumour suppression, and that the accumulation of alphaKG in p53-deficient tumours can drive tumour-cell differentiation and antagonize malignant progression.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534224", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31534222", "Title": "Electrical and synaptic integration of glioma into neural circuits.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/28 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Sep", "Abstract": "High-grade gliomas are lethal brain cancers whose progression is robustly regulated by neuronal activity.

In mouse progenitor B\ncells, the CTCF-binding element (CBE)-anchored chromatin loop domain(2) at the 3' end of Igh contains an internal subdomain that spans the 5' CBE anchor (IGCR1)(3), the DH segments, and a\nRAG-bound recombination centre (RC)(4). The RC comprises the JH-proximal D segment (DQ52), four JH segments, and the intronic enhancer (iEmu)(5). Robust RAG-mediated cleavage is restricted to paired V(D)J segments flanked\nby complementary recombination signal sequences (12RSS and 23RSS)(6). D segments are flanked downstream and upstream by 12RSSs that mediate deletional joining with convergently oriented JH-23RSSs and VH-23RSSs, respectively(6). Despite 12/23\ncompatibility, inversional D-to-JH joining via upstream D-12RSSs is rare(7,8). Plasmid-based assays have attributed the lack of inversional D-to-JH joining to sequence-based preference for downstream D-12RSSs(9), as opposed to putative linear\nscanning mechanisms(10,11). As RAG linearly scans convergent CBE-anchored chromatin loops(4,12-14), potentially formed by cohesin-mediated loop extrusion(15-18), we revisited its scanning role. Here we show that the chromosomal orientation of JH-23RSS\nprograms RC-bound RAG to linearly scan upstream chromatin in the 3' Igh subdomain for convergently oriented D-12RSSs and, thereby, to mediate deletional joining of all D segments except RC-based DQ52,\nwhich joins by a diffusion-related mechanism. In a DQ52-based RC, formed in the absence of JH segments, RAG bound by the downstream DQ52-RSS scans the downstream constant region exon-containing 3'\nIgh subdomain, in which scanning can be impeded by targeted binding of nuclease-dead Cas9, by transcription through repetitive Igh switch sequences, and by the 3' Igh CBE-based loop anchor.

Here we report a simple route\ntowards the synthesis of hindered ethers, in which electrochemical oxidation is used to liberate high-energy carbocations from simple carboxylic acids. These reactive carbocation intermediates, which are generated with low electrochemical\npotentials, capture an alcohol donor under non-acidic conditions; this enables the formation of a range of ethers (more than 80 have been prepared here) that would otherwise be difficult to\naccess. The carbocations can also be intercepted by simple nucleophiles, leading to the formation of hindered alcohols and even alkyl fluorides. This method was evaluated for its ability to circumvent\nthe synthetic bottlenecks encountered in the preparation of 12 chemical scaffolds, leading to higher yields of the required products, in addition to substantial reductions in the number of steps and\nthe amount of labour required to prepare them.

The Prospective Urban\nRural Epidemiology (PURE) study overcomes these limitations by using similar methods to prospectively measure the effect of modifiable risk factors on cardiovascular disease and mortality across 21 countries (spanning five\ncontinents) grouped by different economic levels. METHODS: In this multinational, prospective cohort study, we examined associations for 14 potentially modifiable risk factors with mortality and cardiovascular disease in 155 722\nparticipants without a prior history of cardiovascular disease from 21 high-income, middle-income, or low-income countries (HICs, MICs, or LICs). The primary outcomes for this paper were composites of cardiovascular disease\nevents (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure) and mortality. We describe the prevalence, hazard ratios (HRs), and population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for cardiovascular disease and mortality associated\nwith a cluster of behavioural factors (ie, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, physical activity, and sodium intake), metabolic factors (ie, lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity), socioeconomic and psychosocial factors (ie, education,\nsymptoms of depression), grip strength, and household and ambient pollution. Associations between risk factors and the outcomes were established using multivariable Cox frailty models and using PAFs for the entire\ncohort, and also by countries grouped by income level. Associations are presented as HRs and PAFs with 95% CIs. FINDINGS: Between Jan 6, 2005, and Dec 4, 2016, 155 722\nparticipants were enrolled and followed up for measurement of risk factors. 17 249 (11.1%) participants were from HICs, 102 680 (65.9%) were from MICs, and 35 793 (23.0%) from LICs.\nApproximately 70% of cardiovascular disease cases and deaths in the overall study population were attributed to modifiable risk factors. Metabolic factors were the predominant risk factors for cardiovascular disease (41.2%\nof the PAF), with hypertension being the largest (22.3% of the PAF). As a cluster, behavioural risk factors contributed most to deaths (26.3% of the PAF), although the single largest\nrisk factor was a low education level (12.5% of the PAF). Ambient air pollution was associated with 13.9% of the PAF for cardiovascular disease, although different statistical methods were used\nfor this analysis. In MICs and LICs, household air pollution, poor diet, low education, and low grip strength had stronger effects on cardiovascular disease or mortality than in HICs. INTERPRETATION:\nMost cardiovascular disease cases and deaths can be attributed to a small number of common, modifiable risk factors. While some factors have extensive global effects (eg, hypertension and education), others\n(eg, household air pollution and poor diet) vary by a country's economic level. Health policies should focus on risk factors that have the greatest effects on averting cardiovascular disease and\ndeath globally, with additional emphasis on risk factors of greatest importance in specific groups of countries.

In our analysis of the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, we aimed to evaluate differences in\nthe incidence of common diseases, related hospital admissions, and related mortality in a large contemporary cohort of adults from 21 HICs, MICs, and LICs across five continents by use of\nstandardised approaches. METHODS: The PURE study is a prospective, population-based cohort study of individuals aged 35-70 years who have been enrolled from 21 countries across five continents. The key outcomes\nwere the incidence of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular diseases, cancers, injuries, respiratory diseases, and hospital admissions, and we calculated the age-standardised and sex-standardised incidence of these events per 1000 person-years.\nFINDINGS: This analysis assesses the incidence of events in 162 534 participants who were enrolled in the first two phases of the PURE core study, between Jan 6, 2005, and\nDec 4, 2016, and who were assessed for a median of 9.5 years (IQR 8.5-10.9). During follow-up, 11 307 (7.0%) participants died, 9329 (5.7%) participants had cardiovascular disease, 5151 (3.2%)\nparticipants had a cancer, 4386 (2.7%) participants had injuries requiring hospital admission, 2911 (1.8%) participants had pneumonia, and 1830 (1.1%) participants had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cardiovascular disease occurred\nmore often in LICs (7.1 cases per 1000 person-years) and in MICs (6.8 cases per 1000 person-years) than in HICs (4.3 cases per 1000 person-years). However, incident cancers, injuries, COPD,\nand pneumonia were most common in HICs and least common in LICs. Overall mortality rates in LICs (13.3 deaths per 1000 person-years) were double those in MICs (6.9 deaths per\n1000 person-years) and four times higher than in HICs (3.4 deaths per 1000 person-years). This pattern of the highest mortality in LICs and the lowest in HICs was observed for\nall causes of death except cancer, where mortality was similar across country income levels. Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of deaths overall (40%) but accounted for only 23%\nof deaths in HICs (vs 41% in MICs and 43% in LICs), despite more cardiovascular disease risk factors (as judged by INTERHEART risk scores) in HICs and the fewest such\nrisk factors in LICs. The ratio of deaths from cardiovascular disease to those from cancer was 0.4 in HICs, 1.3 in MICs, and 3.0 in LICs, and four upper-MICs (Argentina,\nChile, Turkey, and Poland) showed ratios similar to the HICs. Rates of first hospital admission and cardiovascular disease medication use were lowest in LICs and highest in HICs. INTERPRETATION: Among\nadults aged 35-70 years, cardiovascular disease is the major cause of mortality globally. However, in HICs and some upper-MICs, deaths from cancer are now more common than those from cardiovascular\ndisease, indicating a transition in the predominant causes of deaths in middle-age. As cardiovascular disease decreases in many countries, mortality from cancer will probably become the leading cause of death.\nThe high mortality in poorer countries is not related to risk factors, but it might be related to poorer access to health care.

Previous studies have suggested that post-translational modifications of histones\nare involved in specifying patterns of DNA methyltransferase localization and DNA methylation at promoters and actively transcribed gene bodies(9-11). However, the mechanisms that control the establishment and maintenance of intergenic\nDNA methylation remain poorly understood. Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome (TBRS) is a childhood overgrowth disorder that is defined by germline mutations in DNMT3A. TBRS shares clinical features with Sotos syndrome (which is\ncaused by haploinsufficiency of NSD1, a histone methyltransferase that catalyses the dimethylation of histone H3 at K36 (H3K36me2)(8,12,13)), which suggests that there is a mechanistic link between these two diseases.\nHere we report that NSD1-mediated H3K36me2 is required for the recruitment of DNMT3A and maintenance of DNA methylation at intergenic regions. Genome-wide analysis shows that the binding and activity of\nDNMT3A colocalize with H3K36me2 at non-coding regions of euchromatin. Genetic ablation of Nsd1 and its paralogue Nsd2 in mouse cells results in a redistribution of DNMT3A to H3K36me3-modified gene bodies\nand a reduction in the methylation of intergenic DNA. Blood samples from patients with Sotos syndrome and NSD1-mutant tumours also exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic DNA. The PWWP domain of DNMT3A\nshows dual recognition of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 in vitro, with a higher binding affinity towards H3K36me2 that is abrogated by TBRS-derived missense mutations.

Persisters are subpopulations of bacteria that survive\nantibiotics by reversibly adapting their physiology(3-10), and can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant mutants(11). We investigated whether persisters can also promote the spread of resistance plasmids. In contrast to mutations,\nthe transfer of resistance plasmids requires the co-occurrence of both a donor and a recipient bacterial strain. For our experiments, we chose the facultative intracellular entero-pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium\n(S. Typhimurium) and Escherichia coli, a common member of the microbiota(12). S. Typhimurium forms persisters that survive antibiotic therapy in several host tissues. Here we show that tissue-associated S. Typhimurium\npersisters represent long-lived reservoirs of plasmid donors or recipients. The formation of reservoirs of S. Typhimurium persisters requires Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and/or SPI-2 in gut-associated tissues, or SPI-2 at\nsystemic sites. The re-seeding of these persister bacteria into the gut lumen enables the co-occurrence of donors with gut-resident recipients, and thereby favours plasmid transfer between various strains of Enterobacteriaceae.\nWe observe up to 99% transconjugants within two to three days of re-seeding. Mathematical modelling shows that rare re-seeding events may suffice for a high frequency of conjugation. Vaccination reduces\nthe formation of reservoirs of persisters after oral infection with S.

Influenza A viruses contain a segmented negative-sense\nRNA genome, which is transcribed and replicated by the viral-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (FluPolA) composed of PB1, PB2 and PA subunits(3-5). Although the high-resolution crystal structure of FluPolA of bat influenza\nA virus has previously been reported(6), there are no complete structures available for human and avian FluPolA. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of genomic viral RNA (vRNA) replication-which proceeds through a\ncomplementary RNA (cRNA) replicative intermediate, and requires oligomerization of the polymerase(7-10)-remain largely unknown. Here, using crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, we determine the structures of FluPolA from human influenza A/NT/60/1968 (H3N2)\nand avian influenza A/duck/Fujian/01/2002 (H5N1) viruses at a resolution of 3.0-4.3 A, in the presence or absence of a cRNA or vRNA template.

A paradigmatic example is the many-body localization (MBL) transition, which marks the breakdown of thermalization in an isolated quantum many-body system\nas its disorder increases beyond a critical value(2-11). Characterizing quantum critical behaviour in an MBL system requires probing its entanglement over space and time(4,5,7), which has proved experimentally challenging owing\nto stringent requirements on quantum state preparation and system isolation. Here we observe quantum critical behaviour at the MBL transition in a disordered Bose-Hubbard system and characterize its entanglement via\nits multi-point quantum correlations. We observe the emergence of strong correlations, accompanied by the onset of anomalous diffusive transport throughout the system, and verify their critical nature by measuring their\ndependence on the system size. The correlations extend to high orders in the quantum critical regime and appear to form via a sparse network of many-body resonances that spans the\nentire system(12,13). Our results connect the macroscopic phenomenology of the transition to the system's microscopic structure of quantum correlations, and they provide an essential step towards understanding criticality and universality\nin non-equilibrium systems(1,7,13).", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485075", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31485074", "Title": "Maternal vitamin C regulates reprogramming of DNA methylation and germline development.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Sep", "Abstract": "Development is often assumed to be hardwired in the genome, but several lines of evidence indicate that it is susceptible to environmental modulation with potential long-term consequences, including in mammals(1,2).\nThe embryonic germline is of particular interest because of the potential for intergenerational epigenetic effects. The mammalian germline undergoes extensive DNA demethylation(3-7) that occurs in large part by passive dilution\nof methylation over successive cell divisions, accompanied by active DNA demethylation by TET enzymes(3,8-10). TET activity has been shown to be modulated by nutrients and metabolites, such as vitamin C(11-15).\nHere we show that maternal vitamin C is required for proper DNA demethylation and the development of female fetal germ cells in a mouse model. Maternal vitamin C deficiency does\nnot affect overall embryonic development but leads to reduced numbers of germ cells, delayed meiosis and reduced fecundity in adult offspring. The transcriptome of germ cells from vitamin-C-deficient embryos is\nremarkably similar to that of embryos carrying a null mutation in Tet1. Vitamin C deficiency leads to an aberrant DNA methylation profile that includes incomplete demethylation of key regulators of\nmeiosis and transposable elements.

Invasion of surrounding tissues and metastasis have been proposed to initiate following loss of the intercellular adhesion protein, E-cadherin(1,2),\non the basis of inverse correlations between in vitro migration and E-cadherin levels(3). However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with the observation that most breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas and\nexpress E-cadherin in primary tumours and metastases(4). To resolve this discrepancy, we tested the genetic requirement for E-cadherin in metastasis using mouse and human models of both luminal and basal\ninvasive ductal carcinomas. Here we show that E-cadherin promotes metastasis in diverse models of invasive ductal carcinomas. While loss of E-cadherin increased invasion, it also reduced cancer cell proliferation and\nsurvival, circulating tumour cell number, seeding of cancer cells in distant organs and metastasis outgrowth. Transcriptionally, loss of E-cadherin was associated with upregulation of genes involved in transforming growth factor-beta\n(TGFbeta), reactive oxygen species and apoptosis signalling pathways. At the cellular level, disseminating E-cadherin-negative cells exhibited nuclear enrichment of SMAD2/3, oxidative stress and increased apoptosis. Colony formation of E-cadherin-negative cells\nwas rescued by inhibition of TGFbeta-receptor signalling, reactive oxygen accumulation or apoptosis. Our results reveal that E-cadherin acts as a survival factor in invasive ductal carcinomas during the detachment, systemic\ndissemination and seeding phases of metastasis by limiting reactive oxygen-mediated apoptosis.

The C-terminal catalytic SET (Su(var.)3-9, enhancer of zeste and trithorax) domains of MLL proteins are associated with a common set of\nregulatory factors (WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L and DPY30) to achieve specific activities(7-9). Current knowledge of the regulation of MLL activity is limited to the catalysis of histone H3 peptides, and how\nH3K4 methyl marks are deposited on nucleosomes is poorly understood. H3K4 methylation is stimulated by mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 120 (H2BK120ub1), a prevalent histone H2B mark that disrupts\nchromatin compaction and favours open chromatin structures, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown(10-12). Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human MLL1 and MLL3 catalytic modules associated with nucleosome core\nparticles that contain H2BK120ub1 or unmodified H2BK120. These structures demonstrate that the MLL1 and MLL3 complexes both make extensive contacts with the histone-fold and DNA regions of the nucleosome; this\nallows ease of access to the histone H3 tail, which is essential for the efficient methylation of H3K4. The H2B-conjugated ubiquitin binds directly to RBBP5, orienting the association between MLL1\nor MLL3 and the nucleosome. The MLL1 and MLL3 complexes display different structural organizations at the interface between the WDR5, RBBP5 and MLL1 (or the corresponding MLL3) subunits, which accounts\nfor the opposite roles of WDR5 in regulating the activity of the two enzymes.

Our proxy time series from Lake Ohrid on the Balkan Peninsula, together with a 784,000-year transient\nclimate model hindcast, suggest that increased sea surface temperatures amplify local cyclone development and refuel North Atlantic low-pressure systems that enter the Mediterranean during phases of low continental ice volume\nand high concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases.

It relies on the interplay between intrinsic forces generated by molecular motors(1-3),\nextrinsic forces exerted by adjacent cells(4-7) and mechanical resistance forces due to tissue elasticity or friction(8-10). Understanding how mechanical forces influence morphogenesis at the cellular and molecular level remains a\nchallenge(1). Recent work has outlined how small incremental steps power cell-autonomous epithelial shape changes(1-3), which suggests the existence of specific mechanisms that stabilize cell shapes and counteract cell elasticity. Beyond\nthe twofold stage, embryonic elongation in Caenorhabditis elegans is dependent on both muscle activity(7) and the epidermis; the tension generated by muscle activity triggers a mechanotransduction pathway in the epidermis\nthat promotes axis elongation(7). Here we identify a network that stabilizes cell shapes in C. elegans embryos at a stage that involves non-autonomous mechanical interactions between epithelia and contractile cells.\nWe searched for factors genetically or molecularly interacting with the p21-activating kinase homologue PAK-1 and acting in this pathway, thereby identifying the alpha-spectrin SPC-1. Combined absence of PAK-1 and SPC-1\ninduced complete axis retraction, owing to defective epidermal actin stress fibre. Modelling predicts that a mechanical viscoplastic deformation process can account for embryo shape stabilization. Molecular analysis suggests that the\ncellular basis for viscoplasticity originates from progressive shortening of epidermal microfilaments that are induced by muscle contractions relayed by actin-severing proteins and from formin homology 2 domain-containing protein 1 (FHOD-1)\nformin bundling.

NNT catalyses the transfer of a\nhydride between NADH and NADP(+), coupled to the translocation of one proton across the membrane. Its main physiological function is the generation of NADPH, which is a substrate in anabolic\nreactions and a regulator of oxidative status; however, NNT may also fine-tune the Krebs cycle(1,2). NNT deficiency causes familial glucocorticoid deficiency in humans and metabolic abnormalities in mice, similar to\nthose observed in type II diabetes(3,4). The catalytic mechanism of NNT has been proposed to involve a rotation of around 180 degrees of the entire NADP(H)-binding domain that alternately participates\nin hydride transfer and proton-channel gating. However, owing to the lack of high-resolution structures of intact NNT, the details of this process remain unclear(5,6).

Such electrical actuation is mainly achieved by electrowetting, with droplets attracted towards and spreading on a conductive substrate in response to an applied voltage. To ensure strong\nand practical actuation, the substrate is covered with a dielectric layer and a hydrophobic topcoat for electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD)(11-13); this increases the actuation voltage (to about 100 volts) and can compromise\nreliability owing to dielectric breakdown(14), electric charging(15) and biofouling(16). Here we demonstrate droplet manipulation that uses electrical signals to induce the liquid to dewet, rather than wet, a hydrophilic conductive\nsubstrate without the need for added layers. In this electrodewetting mechanism, which is phenomenologically opposite to electrowetting, the liquid-substrate interaction is not controlled directly by electric field but instead by\nfield-induced attachment and detachment of ionic surfactants to the substrate.

Its versatility arises from architecturally complex polyubiquitin chains, in which individual ubiquitin moieties may be ubiquitinated on one\nor multiple residues, and/or modified by phosphorylation and acetylation(1-3). Advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the mapping of individual ubiquitin modifications that generate the ubiquitin code; however, the architecture of\npolyubiquitin signals has remained largely inaccessible. Here we introduce Ub-clipping as a methodology by which to understand polyubiquitin signals and architectures. Ub-clipping uses an engineered viral protease, Lb(pro) *, to\nincompletely remove ubiquitin from substrates and leave the signature C-terminal GlyGly dipeptide attached to the modified residue; this simplifies the direct assessment of protein ubiquitination on substrates and within polyubiquitin.\nMonoubiquitin generated by Lb(pro) * retains GlyGly-modified residues, enabling the quantification of multiply GlyGly-modified branch-point ubiquitin. Notably, we find that a large amount (10-20%) of ubiquitin in polymers seems to\nexist as branched chains. Moreover, Ub-clipping enables the assessment of co-existing ubiquitin modifications. The analysis of depolarized mitochondria reveals that PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy predominantly exploits mono- and short-chain polyubiquitin, in which\nphosphorylated ubiquitin moieties are not further modified.

Our mathematical predictions are supported by a behavioural experiment in which we vary the endowments and productivities\nof the subjects. We observe that overall welfare is maximized when the two sources of heterogeneity are aligned, such that more productive individuals receive higher endowments.

The wave does not require sustained gene transcription, and is not governed by regulated\nFog delivery. Instead, MyoII inhibition blocks Rho1 activation and propagation, revealing a mechanical feedback driven by MyoII. We find that MyoII activation and invagination in each row of cells drives\nadhesion to the vitelline membrane mediated by integrins, apical spreading, MyoII activation and invagination in the next row.

Endotherms can maintain their body temperature (Tb) over a wide range of ambient temperatures primarily using\nthe heat that is generated continuously by their high basal metabolic rate (BMR)(1). There is also an important positive feedback loop as Tb influences BMR(1-3). Owing to this interplay between\nBMRs and Tb, many ecologists and evolutionary physiologists posit that the evolution of BMR and Tb must have been coupled during the radiation of endotherms(3-5), changing with similar trends(6-8). However,\ncolder historical environments might have imposed strong selective pressures on BMR to compensate for increased rates of heat loss and to keep Tb constant(9-12). Thus, adaptation to cold ambient temperatures\nthrough increases in BMR could have decoupled BMR from Tb and caused different evolutionary routes to the modern diversity in these traits. Here we show that BMR and Tb were\ndecoupled in approximately 90% of mammalian phylogenetic branches and 36% of avian phylogenetic branches. Mammalian BMRs evolved with rapid bursts but without a long-term directional trend, whereas Tb evolved mostly\nat a constant rate and towards colder bodies from a warmer-bodied common ancestor. Avian BMRs evolved predominantly at a constant rate and without a long-term directional trend, whereas Tb evolved\nwith much greater rate heterogeneity and with adaptive evolution towards colder bodies. Furthermore, rapid shifts that lead to both increases and decreases in BMRs were linked to abrupt changes towards\ncolder ambient temperatures-although only in mammals. Our results suggest that natural selection effectively exploited the diversity in mammalian BMRs under diverse, often-adverse historical thermal environments.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413362", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31413361", "Title": "Wnt and TGFbeta coordinate growth and patterning to regulate size-dependent behaviour.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Aug", "Abstract": "Differential coordination of growth and patterning across metazoans gives rise to a diversity of sizes and shapes at tissue, organ and organismal levels.

The large subunit of Pol\nII contains an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain that is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases during the transition from initiation to elongation, thus influencing the interaction of the C-terminal domain with different\ncomponents of the initiation or the RNA-splicing apparatus(5,6). Recent observations suggest that this model provides only a partial picture of the effects of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain(7-12). Both the\ntranscription-initiation machinery and the splicing machinery can form phase-separated condensates that contain large numbers of component molecules: hundreds of molecules of Pol II and mediator are concentrated in condensates at\nsuper-enhancers(7,8), and large numbers of splicing factors are concentrated in nuclear speckles, some of which occur at highly active transcription sites(9-12). Here we investigate whether the phosphorylation of the Pol\nII C-terminal domain regulates the incorporation of Pol II into phase-separated condensates that are associated with transcription initiation and splicing. We find that the hypophosphorylated C-terminal domain of Pol II\nis incorporated into mediator condensates and that phosphorylation by regulatory cyclin-dependent kinases reduces this incorporation. We also find that the hyperphosphorylated C-terminal domain is preferentially incorporated into condensates that are\nformed by splicing factors. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain drives an exchange from condensates that are involved in transcription initiation to those that are\ninvolved in RNA processing, and implicates phosphorylation as a mechanism that regulates condensate preference.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391587", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31391586", "Title": "A national experiment reveals where a growth mindset improves achievement.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/18 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Sep", "Abstract": "A global priority for the behavioural sciences is to develop cost-effective, scalable interventions that could improve the academic outcomes of adolescents at a population level, but no such interventions have\nso far been evaluated in a population-generalizable sample.

The enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4\n(GPX4) is a central regulator of ferroptosis, and protects cells by neutralizing lipid peroxides, which are by-products of cellular metabolism. The direct inhibition of GPX4, or indirect inhibition by depletion\nof its substrate glutathione or the building blocks of glutathione (such as cysteine), can trigger ferroptosis(3). Ferroptosis contributes to the antitumour function of several tumour suppressors such as p53, BAP1\nand fumarase(4-7). Counterintuitively, mesenchymal cancer cells-which are prone to metastasis, and often resistant to various treatments-are highly susceptible to ferroptosis(8,9). Here we show that ferroptosis can be regulated non-cell-autonomously by\ncadherin-mediated intercellular interactions. In epithelial cells, such interactions mediated by E-cadherin suppress ferroptosis by activating the intracellular NF2 (also known as merlin) and Hippo signalling pathway. Antagonizing this signalling axis\nallows the proto-oncogenic transcriptional co-activator YAP to promote ferroptosis by upregulating several ferroptosis modulators, including ACSL4 and TFRC. This finding provides mechanistic insights into the observations that cancer cells with\nmesenchymal or metastatic property are highly sensitive to ferroptosis(8). Notably, a similar mechanism also modulates ferroptosis in some non-epithelial cells. Finally, genetic inactivation of the tumour suppressor NF2, a frequent\ntumorigenic event in mesothelioma(10,11), rendered cancer cells more sensitive to ferroptosis in an orthotopic mouse model of malignant mesothelioma.

The activity of SidEs is regulated by\nanother Dot/Icm effector known as SidJ(5); however, the mechanism of this regulation is not completely understood(6,7).

Here we use detailed datasets of existing fossil-fuel energy infrastructure in 2018 to estimate regional and sectoral patterns of\ncommitted CO2 emissions, the sensitivity of such emissions to assumed operating lifetimes and schedules, and the economic value of the associated infrastructure. We estimate that, if operated as historically, existing\ninfrastructure will cumulatively emit about 658 gigatonnes of CO2 (with a range of 226 to 1,479 gigatonnes CO2, depending on the lifetimes and utilization rates assumed). More than half of\nthese emissions are predicted to come from the electricity sector; infrastructure in China, the USA and the 28 member states of the European Union represents approximately 41 per cent, 9\nper cent and 7 per cent of the total, respectively. If built, proposed power plants (planned, permitted or under construction) would emit roughly an extra 188 (range 37-427) gigatonnes CO2.\nCommitted emissions from existing and proposed energy infrastructure (about 846 gigatonnes CO2) thus represent more than the entire carbon budget that remains if mean warming is to be limited to\n1.5 degrees Celsius ( degrees C) with a probability of 66 to 50 per cent (420-580 gigatonnes CO2)(5), and perhaps two-thirds of the remaining carbon budget if mean warming is\nto be limited to less than 2 degrees C (1,170-1,500 gigatonnes CO2)(5). The remaining carbon budget estimates are varied and nuanced(14,15), and depend on the climate target and the availability\nof large-scale negative emissions(16). Nevertheless, our estimates suggest that little or no new CO2-emitting infrastructure can be commissioned, and that existing infrastructure may need to be retired early (or be\nretrofitted with carbon capture and storage technology) in order to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals(17). Given the asset value per tonne of committed emissions, we suggest that the most\ncost-effective premature infrastructure retirements will be in the electricity and industry sectors, if non-emitting alternatives are available and affordable(4,18).", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261374", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31243383", "Title": "Move over, DNA: ancient proteins are starting to reveal humanity's history.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/14 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Jun", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243383", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31243375", "Title": "Lessons learnt from doing research amid a humanitarian crisis.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/05 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Jun", "Abstract": "NA", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243375", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31243362", "Title": "Immune evasion before tumour invasion in early lung squamous carcinogenesis.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/03/24 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 Jul", "Abstract": "Early detection and treatment are critical for improving the outcome of patients with cancer(1).

Two major\nmechanisms have been proposed to explain organic carbon preservation: selective preservation of biochemically unreactive compounds(4,5) and protection resulting from interactions with a mineral matrix(6,7). Although both mechanisms can operate across\na range of environments and timescales, their global relative importance on 1,000-year to 100,000-year timescales remains uncertain(4). Here we present a global dataset of the distributions of organic carbon activation\nenergy and corresponding radiocarbon ages in soils, sediments and dissolved organic carbon. We find that activation energy distributions broaden over time in all mineral-containing samples. This result requires increasing bond-strength\ndiversity, consistent with the formation of organo-mineral bonds(8) but inconsistent with selective preservation. Radiocarbon ages further reveal that high-energy, mineral-bound organic carbon persists for millennia relative to low-energy, unbound organic\ncarbon.

Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analyses show this segregation as a plaid pattern of contact enrichment within euchromatin and heterochromatin compartments(3),\nand depletion between them. Many mechanisms for the formation of compartments have been proposed, such as attraction of heterochromatin to the nuclear lamina(2,4), preferential attraction of similar chromatin to each\nother(1,4-12), higher levels of chromatin mobility in active chromatin(13-15) and transcription-related clustering of euchromatin(16,17).

An important question is how the responses to these diverse variables are organized across the population of dopamine neurons. Whether individual dopamine neurons multiplex several variables, or\nwhether there are subsets of neurons that are specialized in encoding specific behavioural variables remains unclear. This fundamental question has been difficult to resolve because recordings from large populations of\nindividual dopamine neurons have not been performed in a behavioural task with sufficient complexity to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. Here, to address this gap, we used two-photon calcium imaging\nthrough an implanted lens to record the activity of more than 300 dopamine neurons from the ventral tegmental area of the mouse midbrain during a complex decision-making task. As mice\nnavigated in a virtual-reality environment, dopamine neurons encoded an array of sensory, motor and cognitive variables. These responses were functionally clustered, such that subpopulations of neurons transmitted information about a\nsubset of behavioural variables, in addition to encoding reward. These functional clusters were spatially organized, with neighbouring neurons more likely to be part of the same cluster.

Many studies have characterized the genomic landscape of breast cancer during its early stages. However, there is evidence\nthat genomic alterations are acquired during the evolution of cancers from their early to late stages, and that the genomic landscape of early cancers is not representative of that of\nlethal cancers(1-7). Here we investigated the landscape of somatic alterations in 617 metastatic breast cancers. Nine driver genes (TP53, ESR1, GATA3, KMT2C, NCOR1, AKT1, NF1, RIC8A and RB1) were more\nfrequently mutated in metastatic breast cancers that expressed hormone receptors (oestrogen and/or progesterone receptors; HR(+)) but did not have high levels of HER2 (HER2(-); n = 381), when compared to\nearly breast cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, 18 amplicons were more frequently observed in HR(+)/HER2(-) metastatic breast cancers. These cancers showed an increase in mutational signatures S2,\nS3, S10, S13 and S17. Among the gene alterations that were enriched in HR(+)/HER2(-) metastatic breast cancers, mutations in TP53, RB1 and NF1, together with S10, S13 and S17, were\nassociated with poor outcome. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancers showed an increase in the frequency of somatic biallelic loss-of-function mutations in genes related to homologous recombination DNA repair, compared to early\ntriple-negative breast cancers (7% versus 2%). Finally, metastatic breast cancers showed an increase in mutational burden and clonal diversity compared to early breast cancers. Thus, the genomic landscape of metastatic\nbreast cancer is enriched in clinically relevant genomic alterations and is more complex than that of early breast cancer. The identification of genomic alterations associated with poor outcome will allow\nearlier and better selection of patients who require the use of treatments that are still in clinical trials.

The methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me) characterizes\nheterochromatin and mediates both transcriptional repression and chromatin anchoring at the inner nuclear membrane(4). In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, chromodomain protein CEC-4 bound to the inner nuclear membrane tethers heterochromatin through\nH3K9me(3,5), whereas in differentiated tissues, a second heterochromatin-sequestering pathway is induced. Here we use an RNA interference screen in the cec-4 background and identify MRG-1 as a broadly expressed factor\nthat is necessary for this second chromatin anchor in intestinal cells. However, MRG-1 is exclusively bound to euchromatin, suggesting that it acts indirectly. Heterochromatin detachment in double mrg-1; cec-4 mutants\nis rescued by depleting the histone acetyltransferase CBP-1/p300 or the transcription factor ATF-8, a member of the bZIP family (which is known to recruit CBP/p300). Overexpression of CBP-1 in cec-4\nmutants is sufficient to delocalize heterochromatin in an ATF-8-dependent manner. CBP-1 and H3K27ac levels increase in heterochromatin upon mrg-1 knockdown, coincident with delocalization. This suggests that the spatial organization of\nchromatin in C. elegans is regulated both by the direct perinuclear attachment of silent chromatin, and by an active retention of CBP-1/p300 in euchromatin.

Rapid and accurate formation of the 70S initiation complex is promoted by initiation factors, which must dissociate from the 30S initiation\ncomplex before the resulting 70S elongation-competent complex can begin the elongation of translation(1). Although comparisons of the structures of the 30S(2-5) and 70S(4,6-8) initiation complexes have revealed that the ribosome,\ninitiation factors and fMet-tRNA(fMet) can acquire different conformations in these complexes, the timing of conformational changes during formation of the 70S initiation complex, the structures of any intermediates formed during\nthese rearrangements, and the contributions that these dynamics might make to the mechanism and regulation of initiation remain unknown. Moreover, the absence of a structure of the 70S elongation-competent complex\nformed via an initiation-factor-catalysed reaction has precluded an understanding of the rearrangements to the ribosome, initiation factors and fMet-tRNA(fMet) that occur during maturation of a 70S initiation complex into a\n70S elongation-competent complex.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a highly informative model for cancer evolution as it undergoes substantial genetic\ndiversification and evolution after therapy(2,3). The CLL epigenome is also an important disease-defining feature(4,5), and growing populations of cells in CLL diversify by stochastic changes in DNA methylation known as\nepimutations(6). However, previous studies using bulk sequencing methods to analyse the patterns of DNA methylation were unable to determine whether epimutations affect CLL populations homogeneously. Here, to measure the epimutation\nrate at single-cell resolution, we applied multiplexed single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing to B cells from healthy donors and patients with CLL. We observed that the common clonal origin of CLL\nresults in a consistently increased epimutation rate, with low variability in the cell-to-cell epimutation rate. By contrast, variable epimutation rates across healthy B cells reflect diverse evolutionary ages across the\ntrajectory of B cell differentiation, consistent with epimutations serving as a molecular clock. Heritable epimutation information allowed us to reconstruct lineages at high-resolution with single-cell data, and to apply this\ndirectly to patient samples. The CLL lineage tree shape revealed earlier branching and longer branch lengths than in normal B cells, reflecting rapid drift after the initial malignant transformation and\na greater proliferative history. Integration of single-cell bisulfite sequencing analysis with single-cell transcriptomes and genotyping confirmed that genetic subclones mapped to distinct clades, as inferred solely on the basis of\nepimutation information. Finally, to examine potential lineage biases during therapy, we profiled serial samples during ibrutinib-associated lymphocytosis, and identified clades of cells that were preferentially expelled from the lymph node\nafter treatment, marked by distinct transcriptional profiles.

Owing to a high mutation rate and low levels of recombination of mitrochondrial DNA\n(mtDNA), special selection mechanisms exist in the female germline to prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations(1-5). However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin selection are poorly understood(6). Here we visualize germline\nselection in Drosophila using an allele-specific fluorescent in situ-hybridization approach to distinguish wild-type from mutant mtDNA. Selection first manifests in the early stages of Drosophila oogenesis, triggered by reduction of\nthe pro-fusion protein Mitofusin. This leads to the physical separation of mitochondrial genomes into different mitochondrial fragments, which prevents the mixing of genomes and their products and thereby reduces complementation.\nOnce fragmented, mitochondria that contain mutant genomes are less able to produce ATP, which marks them for selection through a process that requires the mitophagy proteins Atg1 and BNIP3. A\nreduction in Atg1 or BNIP3 decreases the amount of wild-type mtDNA, which suggests a link between mitochondrial turnover and mtDNA replication. Fragmentation is not only necessary for selection in germline\ntissues, but is also sufficient to induce selection in somatic tissues in which selection is normally absent. We postulate that there is a generalizable mechanism for selection against deleterious mtDNA\nmutations, which may enable the development of strategies for the treatment of mtDNA disorders.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092924", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "31092920", "Title": "Distinct modes of cell competition shape mammalian tissue morphogenesis.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/07 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 May", "Abstract": "Cell competition-the sensing and elimination of less fit 'loser' cells by neighbouring 'winner' cells-was first described in Drosophila.

In the single-layered epithelium of the early embryonic epidermis, winner progenitors kill and subsequently clear neighbouring loser cells by\nengulfment. Later, as the tissue begins to stratify, the basal layer instead expels losers through upward flux of differentiating progeny.

Sequential oxidation of 5mC by ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases results in a cascade of additional\nepigenetic marks and promotes demethylation of DNA in mammals(1,2). However, the enzymatic activity and function of TET homologues in other eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here we show that the green\nalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains a 5mC-modifying enzyme (CMD1) that is a TET homologue and catalyses the conjugation of a glyceryl moiety to the methyl group of 5mC through a carbon-carbon\nbond, resulting in two stereoisomeric nucleobase products. The catalytic activity of CMD1 requires Fe(II) and the integrity of its binding motif His-X-Asp, which is conserved in Fe-dependent dioxygenases(3). However, unlike\npreviously described TET enzymes, which use 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate(4), CMD1 uses L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as an essential co-substrate. Vitamin C donates the glyceryl moiety to 5mC with concurrent\nformation of glyoxylic acid and CO2. The vitamin-C-derived DNA modification is present in the genome of wild-type C. reinhardtii but at a substantially lower level in a CMD1 mutant strain.\nThe fitness of CMD1 mutant cells during exposure to high light levels is reduced. LHCSR3, a gene that is critical for the protection of C. reinhardtii from photo-oxidative damage under\nhigh light conditions, is hypermethylated and downregulated in CMD1 mutant cells compared to wild-type cells, causing a reduced capacity for photoprotective non-photochemical quenching.

Here we model RB loss during lung adenocarcinoma progression and pathway reactivation in established oncogenic KRAS-driven tumours\nin mice. We show that RB loss enables cancer cells to bypass two distinct barriers during tumour progression. First, RB loss abrogates the requirement for amplification of the MAPK signal\nduring malignant progression. We identify CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of RB as an effector of MAPK signalling and critical mediator of resistance to inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6. Second, RB inactivation deregulates\nthe expression of cell-state-determining factors, facilitates lineage infidelity and accelerates the acquisition of metastatic competency. By contrast, reactivation of RB reprograms advanced tumours towards a less metastatic cell state, but\nis nevertheless unable to halt cancer cell proliferation and tumour growth due to adaptive rewiring of MAPK pathway signalling, which restores a CDK-dependent suppression of RB.

We engineered two CBE variants bearing mutations in rat APOBEC1 that substantially decreased the number of RNA edits (by more than 390-fold and more than 3,800-fold) in\nhuman cells. These variants also showed more precise on-target DNA editing than the wild-type CBE and, for most guide RNAs tested, no substantial reduction in editing efficiency. Finally, we show\nthat an adenine base editor(7) can also induce transcriptome-wide RNA edits. These results have implications for the use of base editors in both research and clinical settings, illustrate the feasibility\nof engineering improved variants with reduced RNA editing activities, and suggest the need to more fully define and characterize the RNA off-target effects of deaminase enzymes in base editor platforms.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995674", "Tag": "NEJM[journal] OR BMJ[journal] OR lancet[journal] OR nature[journal] OR JAMA[journal] "}, {"PMID": "30959515", "Title": "The emergent landscape of the mouse gut endoderm at single-cell resolution.", "JournalName": "Nature", "Creation Date": "2020/02/13 06:00", "Publication Date": "2019 May", "Abstract": "Here we delineate the ontogeny of the mammalian endoderm by generating 112,217 single-cell transcriptomes, which represent all endoderm populations within the mouse embryo until midgestation.

METHODS: Molecular docking on the binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of common laboratory mammals and\nthe receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the golden Syrian hamster is an option. Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed.

RESULTS: The Syrian hamster could be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2. Maximal clinical signs\nof rapid breathing, weight loss, histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair, airway and intestinal\ninvolvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression, high lung viral load, and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation were observed within the first week of virus challenge.

Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical symptoms. We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases with GI\nsymptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics. DESIGN: COVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020.\nEpidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type. Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of\nSARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province. RESULTS: Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period\nand 10.8% had pre-existing liver disease. Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without\nGI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%). Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever >38.5\ndegrees C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively. Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 14.86% and 41.89% of patients, respectively. Sputum production and increased lactate dehydrogenase/glucose levels were\nrisk factors for severe/critical type. Bioinformatics showed sequence mutation of SARS-CoV-2 with m(6)A methylation and changed binding capacity with ACE2.

This study is performed to analyze\nthe clinical characteristics of patients who succumbed to and who recovered from 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: Clinical data were collected from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. A retrospective\ninvestigation was conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of fatal cases of COVID-19 (death group) and compare them with recovered patients (recovered group). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney\nU test. Categorical variables were analyzed by chi test or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. RESULTS: Our study enrolled 109 COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization and 116 recovered patients.\nThe median age of the death group was older than the recovered group (69 [62, 74] years vs. 40 [33, 57] years, Z = 9.738, P < 0.001). More patients\nin the death group had underlying diseases (72.5% vs. 41.5%, chi = 22.105, P < 0.001).

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly. Many of those patients are treated with reninangiotensin system blockers. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a\nsevere and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The present article discusses this concept. ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates\nin blood at very low levels. As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2\nbecause ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and\ndiffers among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs. Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1\nreceptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans. Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.\nIn summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32208987", "Tag": ";(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32212058", "Title": "Protecting healthcare personnel from 2019-nCoV infection risks: lessons and suggestions.", "JournalName": "Frontiers of medicine", "Creation Date": "2020/03/27 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 23", "Abstract": "The outbreak of a novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19, caused by the 2019-nCoV infection) in December 2019 is one of the most severe public health emergencies since the founding of People's\nRepublic of China in 1949.

COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria\nfor being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO)\nand multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of\nCOVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but\nnot curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or\n(UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in\nan attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ\ndamage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the\navoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients\nwere treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of\ndecreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis\nof coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered\nfor compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20-91 years old) who did\nnot receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China. Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4 days) or progressive-stage\ngroup (onset of symptoms within 4-7 days) for analysis. CT characteristics and the distribution, size, and CT score of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were assessed. RESULTS: In our study, the major\ncharacteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 was ground-glass opacity (61.3%), followed by ground-glass opacity with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacities (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%). No patient\npresented cavitation, a reticular pattern, or bronchial wall thickening.

CONCLUSIONS: Multiple\nground-glass opacities with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019. CT score can be used to evaluate the severity of the\ndisease. If these typical alterations are found, then the differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 must be considered. KEY POINTS: * Multiple GGOs with consolidations in the periphery of the\nlungs were the primary CT characteristic of COVID-19. * The halo sign may be a special CT feature in the early-stage COVID-19 patients. * Significantly increased CT score may indicate\nthe aggravation of COVID-19 in the progressive stage.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32211963", "Tag": "(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}, {"PMID": "32208140", "Title": "The Battle Against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Emergency Management and Infection Control in a Radiology Department.", "JournalName": "Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR", "Creation Date": "2020/03/26 06:00", "Publication Date": "2020 Mar 21", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the strategy and the emergency management and infection control procedures of our radiology department during the COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center study on patients with COVID-19 from Jan. 18, 2020 to\nFeb. 7, 2020 in Zhuhai, China. Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with\npositive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). CT visual quantitative evaluation was based on summing up the acute lung inflammatory lesions involving each lobe, which was scored as\n0 (0%), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), or 4 (76-100%), respectively. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores. The consistency of two observers\nwas evaluated. The TSS was compared with the clinical classification. ROC was used to test the diagnosis ability of TSS for severe-critical type. RESULTS: This study included 78 patients, 38\nmales and 40 females. There were 24 mild (30.8%), 46 common (59.0%), and 8 severe-critical (10.2%) cases, respectively. The median TSS of severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than common type\n(p < 0.001). The ICC value of the two observers was 0.976 (95% CI 0.962-0.985). ROC analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of TSS for diagnosing severe-critical type\nwas 0.918. The TSS cutoff of 7.5 had 82.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of clinical mild-type patients with COVID-19 was relatively high; CT was not suitable for\nindependent screening tool. The CT visual quantitative analysis has high consistency and can reflect the clinical classification of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: * CT visual quantitative evaluation has high consistency (ICC\nvalue of 0.976) among the observers. The median TSS of severe-critical type group was significantly higher than common type (p < 0.001). * ROC analysis showed the area under the\ncurve (AUC) of TSS for diagnosing severe-critical type was 0.918 (95% CI 0.843-0.994). The TSS cutoff of 7.5 had 82.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. * The proportion of confirmed COVID-19\npatients with normal chest CT was relatively high (30.8%); CT was not a suitable screening modality.", "Link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215691", "Tag": "(treatment[All Fields] OR drug[All Fields] OR intervention[All Fields] OR recovery[All Fields])"}]
