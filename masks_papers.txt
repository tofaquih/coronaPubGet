AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the strategy and the emergency management and infection
      control procedures of our radiology department during the COVID-19 outbreak.
      METHODS: We set up emergency management and sensing control teams. The team
      formulated various measures, such as reconfiguration of the radiology department,
      personal protection and staff training, standardized imaging examination
      procedures for fever patients and common patients, and so on. RESULTS: From
      January 21 to March 9, 3,083 people underwent fever-CT examinations. Including
      the initial examination and reexamination, the total number of fever CT
      examination is 3,340. As a result of our precautions, none of the staff of the
      radiology department was infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Strategic planning
      and adequate protections can help protect patients and staff against a highly
      infectious disease while allow normal functioning at a high-volume capacity.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is a recent outbreak in
      mainland China and has rapidly spread to multiple countries worldwide. Pulmonary 
      parenchymal opacities are often observed during chest radiography. Currently, few
      cases have reported the complications of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We report a
      case where serial follow-up chest computed tomography revealed progression of
      pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with lower lung
      predominance, thereby confirming COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, complications
      such as mediastinal emphysema, giant bulla, and pneumothorax were also observed
      during the course of the disease.

AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lies
      behind the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a
      growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in the virology, epidemiology and clinical
      management strategies. However, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug or vaccine has been
      officially approved due to the absence of adequate evidence. Scientists are
      racing towards the development of treatment for COVID-19. Recent studies have
      revealed many attractive threptic options, even if some of them remain to be
      further confirmed in rigorous preclinical models and clinical trials. In this
      minireview, we aim to summarize the updated potential approaches against
      SARS-CoV-2. We emphasize that further efforts are warranted to develop the safest
      and most effective approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is rapidly evolving.
      YouTube has been recognized as a popular source of information in previous
      disease outbreaks. We analyzed the content on YouTube about n-CoV in English and 
      Mandarin languages. METHODS: YouTube was searched using the terms '2019 novel
      coronavirus', 'Wuhan virus' and '' (Mandarin for Wuhan virus) on 1st and 2nd
      February 2020. First 50 videos in each group were analyzed. Videos in other
      languages, duplicate videos, those without an audio and duration >15min were
      excluded .72 videos in English and 42 in Mandarin were reviewed. 2 reviewers
      classified the videos as useful, misleading or news based on pre specified
      criterion. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient.
      Modified DISCERN index for reliability and medical information and content index 
      (MICI) score were used for content analysis. RESULTS: These videos attracted
      cumulative 21,288,856 views. 67% of English and 50% Mandarin videos had useful
      information. The viewership of misleading Mandarin videos was higher than the
      useful ones. WHO accounted for only 4% of useful videos. Mean DISCERN score for
      reliability was 3.12/5 and 3.25/5 for English and Mandarin videos respectively.
      Mean cumulative MICI score of useful videos was low (6.71/25 for English and
      6.28/25 for Mandarin). CONCLUSIONS: YouTube viewership during 2019 n-CoV outbreak
      is higher than previous outbreaks. The medical content of videos is suboptimal
      International health agencies are underrepresented. Given its popularity, YouTube
      should be considered as important platform for information dissemination.

AB  - PURPOSE: Lianhuaqingwen (LH) as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula has
      been used to treat influenza and exerted broad-spectrum antiviral effects on a
      series of influenza viruses and immune regulatory effects [1]. The goal of this
      study is to demonstrate the antiviral activity of LH against the novel SARS-CoV-2
      virus and its potential effect in regulating host immune response. METHODS: The
      antiviral activity of LH against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells using
      CPE and plaque reduction assay. The effect of LH on virion morphology was
      visualized under transmission electron microscope. Pro-inflammatory cytokine
      expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by
      real-time quantitative PCR assays. RESULTS: LH significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2
      replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines
      (TNF-alpha, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.
      Furthermore, LH treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of virion in
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: LH significantly inhibits the SARS-COV-2 replication, affects
      virus morphology and exerts anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. These findings
      indicate that LH protects against the virus attack, making its use a novel
      strategy for controlling the COVID-19 disease.

AB  - The outbreak of the new coronavirus infections COVID-19 in December 2019 in China
      has quickly become a global health emergency. Given the lack of specific
      anti-viral therapies, the current management of severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly supportive, even though several compounds
      are now under investigation for the treatment of this life-threatening disease.
      COVID-19 pandemic is certainly conditioning the treatment strategy of a complex
      disorder as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whose infectious risk is increased
      compared to the general population because of an overall impairment of immune
      system typical of autoimmune diseases combined with the iatrogenic effect
      generated by corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. However, the increasing
      knowledge about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is leading to
      consider some anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatment options for the
      management of COVID-19. In this review we will critically analyse the evidences
      on either positive or negative effect of drugs commonly used to treat RA in this 
      particular scenario, in order to optimize the current approach to RA patients.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively analyze the chest imaging findings
      in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on thin-section CT.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection
      underwent thin-section CT examination. Two chest radiologists independently
      evaluated the imaging in terms of distribution, ground-glass opacity (GGO),
      consolidation, air bronchogram, stripe, enlarged mediastinal lymph node, and
      pleural effusion. RESULTS: Fourty-seven cases (88.7%) had findings of COVID-19
      infection, and the other six (11.3%) were normal. Among the 47 cases, 78.7%
      involved both lungs, and 93.6% had peripheral infiltrates distributed along the
      subpleural area. All cases showed GGO, 59.6% of which were round and 40.4%
      patchy. Other imaging features included "crazy-paving pattern" (89.4%),
      consolidation (63.8%), and air bronchogram (76.6%). Air bronchograms were
      observed within GGO (61.7%) and consolidation (70.3%). Neither enlarged
      mediastinal lymph nodes nor pleural effusion were present. Thirty-three patients 
      (62.3%) were followed an average interval of 6.2 +/- 2.9 days. The lesions
      increased in 75.8% and resorbed in 24.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 showed
      the pulmonary lesions in patients infected with COVID-19 were predominantly
      distributed peripherally in the subpleural area.

AB  - Coronavirus disease is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus that
      is moving rapidly. High resolution computed tomography (CT) allows objective
      evaluation of the lung lesions, thus enabling us to better understand the
      pathogenesis of the disease. With serial CT examinations, the occurrence,
      development, and prognosis of the disease can be better understood. The imaging
      can be sorted into four phases: early phase, progressive phase, severe phase, and
      dissipative phase. The CT appearance of each phase and temporal progression of
      the imaging findings are demonstrated.

AB  - A new coronavirus outbreak emerged on the 31(st) of December 2019 in Wuhan,
      China, causing commotion among the medical community and the rest of the world.
      This new species of coronavirus has been termed 2019-nCoV and has caused a
      considerable number of cases of infection and deaths in China and, to a growing
      degree, beyond China, becoming a worldwide public health emergency. 2019-nCoV has
      high homology to other pathogenic coronaviruses, such as those originating from
      bat-related zoonosis (SARS-CoV), which caused approximately 646 deaths in China
      at the start of the decade. The mortality rate for 2019-nCoV is not as high
      (approximately 2-3%), but its rapid propagation has resulted in the activation of
      protocols to stop its spread. This pathogen has the potential to become a
      pandemic. It is therefore vital to follow the personal care recommendations
      issued by the World Health Organisation.

AB  - WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
      related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with
      COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal
      medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown.
      Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully
      selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment
      might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is
      relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. 
      Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious 
      diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, 
      and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while
      adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an
      ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can
      receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this
      procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and
      coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is
      important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is 
      important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and
      respiratory-related mortality.

TI  - Characterization of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of 2019 novel coronavirus: 
      implication for development of RBD protein as a viral attachment inhibitor and
      vaccine.
LID - 10.1038/s41423-020-0400-4 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to
      global public health, calling for the development of safe and effective
      prophylactics and therapeutics against infection of its causative agent, severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important roles
      in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of 
      antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. Here, we identified the
      receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the RBD
      protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
      receptors. SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2
      receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of 
      SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their
      infection to host cells. SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-react with 
      SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could cross-neutralize 
      SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for
      prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.

AB  - The 2019 novel coronavirus disease emerged in China in late 2019-early 2020 and
      spread rapidly. China has been implementing emergency psychological crisis
      interventions to reduce the negative psychosocial impact on public mental health,
      but challenges exist. Public mental health interventions should be formally
      integrated into public health preparedness and emergency response plans.

      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (March, 18).
LID - 10.17235/reed.2020.7052/2020 [doi]
AB  - Infection with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and the disease this agent may induce, are
      a cause of notable concern for the general population and, of course, among our
      professionals and patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is a high-risk
      diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the case of upper GI examinations, and a
      moderate to low-risk intervention when involving lower GI explorations. The
      presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces of patients infected with the virus, and 
      occasionally in colonic biopsy samples, has been consistently documented. In
      fact, viral elimination in the feces may be more prolonged than viral
      identification in respiratory tract secretions. Furthermore, viral transmission
      may occur in asymptomatic individuals. However, as of this moment no information 
      has been reported on the possibility of viral transmission, even to
      professionals, via this route.

AB  - The evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic(1) is certainly cause
      for concern. Proper communication and optimal decision-making is an ongoing
      challenge, as data evolve. The challenge is compounded, however, by exaggerated
      information. This can lead to inappropriate actions. It is important to
      differentiate promptly the true epidemic from an epidemic of false claims and
      potentially harmful actions.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the disease it causes,
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generating a rapid and tragic health
      emergency in Italy due to the need to provide assistance to an overwhelming
      number of infected patients and, at the same time, treat all the non-deferrable
      oncological and benign conditions. A panel of Italian urologists has agreed on
      possible strategies for the reorganization of urological routine practice and on 
      a set of recommendations that should facilitate the process of rescheduling both 
      surgical and outpatient activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the
      subsequent phases. This document could be a valid tool to be used in routine
      clinical practice and, possibly, a cornerstone for further discussion on the
      topic also considering the further evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also
      may provide useful recommendations for national and international urological
      societies in a condition of emergency.

      prognosis than adults.
LID - 10.1111/apa.15270 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected hundreds of
      thousands of people. Data on symptoms and prognoses in children are rare.
      METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on
      COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2), using the Medline and EMBASE databases between 1 January and 18
      March 2020. RESULTS: The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and
      letters. The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1-5% of
      diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths
      have been extremely rare. Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with
      fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have
      developed severe pneumonia. Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in
      children and lymphocytopenia seemed rare. Newborn infants have developed
      symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was
      scarce. Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional
      support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19
      has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and
      better prognoses than adults. Deaths were extremely rare.

AB  - In December of 2019, reports emerged of pneumonia clusters of unknown cause at
      health facilities in Wuhan, China. These cases were linked to a wet animal
      wholesale market in the region and, after extensive epidemiologic investigation, 
      led to identification of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). COVID-19 is among a
      family of viruses-called coronaviruses-that can affect both humans and animals
      (Zhu et al., 2020).

TI  - Prudent public health intervention strategies to control the coronavirus disease 
      2019 transmission in India: A mathematical model-based approach.
LID - 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_504_20 [doi]
AB  - Background & objectives: :Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised urgent
      questions about containment and mitigation, particularly in countries where the
      virus has not yet established human-to-human transmission. The objectives of this
      study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local
      outbreaks of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus
      has already established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact 
      be mitigated through quarantine of symptomatic patients?" Methods: :These
      questions were addressed in the context of India, using simple mathematical
      models of infectious disease transmission. While there remained important
      uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic
      curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model
      assumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps. Results: :It was assumed
      that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of
      symptomatic individuals within three days of developing symptoms. In an
      optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R00) being 1.5, and
      asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would reduce
      the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent. In the pessimistic scenario of R0=4, and
      asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected
      impact falls to two per cent. Interpretation & conclusions: :Port-of-entry-based 
      entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from
      COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of
      the virus into the community. Acting alone, however, such measures would be
      insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer. Once the virus establishes
      transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a
      meaningful impact on disease burden. Model projections are subject to substantial
      uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural
      history of infection of this novel virus. As a public health measure, health
      system and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending
      spread of COVID-19 in the country.

TI  - Guidance for building a dedicated health facility to contain the spread of the
      2019 novel coronavirus outbreak.
LID - 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_518_20 [doi]
AB  - Preparedness for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread
      in India calls for setting up of adequately equipped and dedicated health
      facilities to manage sick patients while protecting healthcare workers and the
      environment. In the wake of other emerging dangerous pathogens in recent times,
      such as Ebola, Nipah and Zika, it is important that such facilities are kept
      ready during the inter-epidemic period for training of health professionals and
      for managing cases of multi-drug resistant and difficult-to-treat pathogens.
      While endemic potential of such critically ill patients is not yet known, the
      health system should have surge capacity for such critical care units and
      preferably each tertiary government hospital should have at least one such
      facility. This article describes elements of design of such unit (e.g., space,
      infection control, waste disposal, safety of healthcare workers, partners to be
      involved in design and plan) which can be adapted to the context of either a new 
      construction or makeshift construction on top of an existing structure. In view
      of a potential epidemic of COVID-19, specific requirements to handle it are also 
      given.

TI  - COVID-19, cytokines and immunosuppression: what can we learn from severe acute
      respiratory syndrome?
AB  - A severe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China in
      December 2019, and spread so rapidly that more than 200,000 cases have so far
      been reported worldwide; on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared it the sixth
      public health emergency of international concern. The two previously reported
      coronavirus epidemics (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East
      respiratory syndrome [MERS]) share similar pathogenetic, epidemiological and
      clinical features as COVID-19. As little is currently known about SARS-CoV-2, it 
      is likely that lessons learned from these major epidemics can be applied to the
      new pandemic, including the use of novel immunosuppressive drugs.

TI  - Dermatology staff participate in fight against Covid-19 in China.
LID - 10.1111/jdv.16390 [doi]
AB  - In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a
      novel coronavirus (Covid-19) [1-2], has become a global health concern [3]. At
      present the epidemic in China has been well controlled, but Covid-19 are
      currently spreading in many other countries all over the world. Dermatologists in
      China have participated in the fight against Covid-19. In this paper we share our
      experiences in dealing with skin diseases in this special period and hope to
      provide some references for international colleagues in the epidemic situation.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus from China, is spreading around the world,
      causing a huge reaction despite its current low incidence outside China and the
      Far East. Four common coronaviruses are in current circulation and cause millions
      of cases worldwide. This article compares the incidence and mortality rates of
      these four common coronaviruses with those of SARS-COV-2 in Organisation for
      Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It is concluded that the problem
      of SARS-CoV-2 is probably being overestimated, as 2.6 million people die of
      respiratory infections each year compared with less than 4000 deaths for
      SARS-CoV-2 at the time of writing.

AB  - The pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in
      December 2019 is a highly contagious disease. The World Health Organization (WHO)
      has declared the ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency. Currently,
      the research on novel coronavirus is still in the primary stage. Based on the
      current published evidence, we systematically summarizes the epidemiology,
      clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of knowledge
      surrounding COVID-19. This review in the hope of helping the public effectively
      recognize and deal with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and providing a 
      reference for future studies.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has significant implications for
      the cardiovascular care of patients. First, those with COVID-19 and preexisting
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an increased risk of severe disease and death. 
      Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect
      cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis,
      arrhythmias and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for 
      COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects. Fourth, the response to COVID-19
      can compromise the rapid triage of non-COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular
      conditions. Finally, the provision of cardiovascular care may place health care
      workers in a position of vulnerability as they become host or vectors of virus
      transmission. We hereby review the peer-reviewed and preprint literature
      pertaining to cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 and highlight
      gaps in knowledge that require further study pertinent to patients, health care
      workers, and health systems.

AB  - A new type of coronavirus, i.e. se-vere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2; formerly known as 2019-nCoV) appeared in December 2019 in the
      province of Hubei, China, and over the past four months the number of cases of
      infection has exceeded 240,000 worldwide, leading to a pandemia [1]. At the
      genetic level, 2019-nCoV is closely related to the SARS-CoV and, to a lesser
      extent, to MERS-CoV, which appeared as epidemiological threats in recent years in
      China and the Middle East, respectively. Infections with the Coronaviridae virus 
      family in a small percentage of patients, especially in those over 60 years of
      age with a positive clinical history, lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome
      [2].

AB  - A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) highlighted at the end of 2019 in China is
      spreading across all continents. Most often at the origin of a mild infectious
      syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible
      digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious
      pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death.Data on the consequences during
      pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the
      symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There
      are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns
      infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal
      transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns
      of infected mothers have been described.Pregnancy is known as a period at higher 
      risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it
      seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor
      closely pregnant women.In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the
      societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have
      proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of
      SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women. These proposals may evolve on a daily basis with 
      the advancement of the epidemic and knowledge in pregnant women. Subsequently, an
      in-depth analysis of cases in pregnant women will be necessary in order to
      improve knowledge on the subject.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the newly identified human coronavirus causing severe pneumonia
      epidemic, was probably originated from Chinese horseshoe bats. However, direct
      transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct
      contact, implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts. Angiotensin
      converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of
      certain species can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated and ranked the 
      receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic
      clustering and sequence alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by
      SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of
      various mammals, except murines, and some birds, such as pigeon. This prediction 
      may help to screen the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      was reported in Wuhan. So far, COVID-19 has affected 84,503 patients in 57
      countries/territories and caused 2,924 deaths in nine countries. However, the
      epidemiology data differ across countries. Although China had higher morbidity
      and mortality than other sites, the number of new cases per day in China is
      lesser than that outside of China since February 26, 2020. The incidence ranged
      from 61.4 per 1,000,000 people in Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1,000,000
      people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative
      cases/no. of days between the first reported case and February 29, 2020) was
      greatest in China (1,320.85 per day), followed by Republic of Korea (78.78 per
      day), Iran (43.11 per day), and Italy (30.62 per day). However, the DCI in other 
      countries/territories were less than 10 per day. Several effective measures
      including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks,
      extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and at once daily press conference by
      government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan.
      This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of February 29, 2020)
      with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which was much lower than that of nearby 
      countries, such as Republic of Korea and Japan. Additionally, the incidence and
      mortality were correlated with DCI. However, further study and continued
      monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.

      countries. Research suggests remarkable genomic resemblance of 2019-nCoV with
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which has a history of a pandemic in
      2002. With evidence of nosocomial spread, a number of diligent measures are being
      employed to constrain its propagation. Hence, the Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern (PHEIC) has been established by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) with strategic objectives for public health to curtail its
      impact on global health and economy.

AB  - The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
      China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I
      converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human
      cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, 
      kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.
      SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate 
      the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single
      cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and
      analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus
      receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, 
      we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte,
      colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach
      epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the
      candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with
      ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and
      ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs,
      suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted 
      "CellPhoneDB" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and
      their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages
      frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis
      signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense
      and immune pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are 
      essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks,
      as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the
      outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review
      existing health security capacities against public health risks and events.
      METHODS: We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR)
      tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) 
      prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational
      readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised
      countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the
      lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data 
      at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 
      countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had
      response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities
      and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these
      countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the
      detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an
      effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including
      infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102
      (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 
      (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2),
      and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control 
      an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at
      level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to
      prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have
      strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an
      effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to
      COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand
      national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and
      collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for
      outbreak control. FUNDING: None.

AB  - In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) emerged in
      Wuhan, Hubei, and spread rapidly to China and over 100 countries around the
      world. The lung injury and repair caused by COVID-19 has many similarities with
      the onset and progression of interstitial lung disease (ILD) . Therefore, it is
      difficult to distinguish between COVID-19 and some types of new-onset ILD or
      other causes leading to acute exacerbation of ILD. Clinicians need to
      comprehensively analyze the epidemic history, disease onset characteristics,
      clinical manifestations, image characteristics, serological andpathogenic
      microorganism test results to confirm diagnosis. Because of this, the article
      will discuss the issues related to the differential diagnosis and management of
      COVID-19 and ILD, and try to provide reasonable suggestions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS CoV-2) that
      began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health.
      This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper
      understanding of this new infectious disease. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical 
      features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and
      clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and
      analyzed in this study. RESULTS: A total of 135 hospitalized patients with
      COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (IQR 36-55), and there was no
      significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact
      with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying
      disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular
      disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever
      (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest CT scans
      showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all of
      the patients. All of the patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%] (Kaletra
      and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and
      corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional
      Chinese medicine (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive
      Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of western and Chinese
      medicine. Compared with the mild cases, the severe cases had lower lymphocyte
      counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, D-dimer, LDH, PCT, ALB, CRP, and
      AST. CONCLUSION: In this study, the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19
      patients were demonstrated. Kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine played an
      important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are
      required to explore the role of Kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine in the
      treatment of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

      pandemic a national emergency. The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases
      increased rather rapidly and changed routine daily activities of the community.
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This brief report describes the response from the
      hospital, the regional blood center, and the hospital-based transfusion services 
      to the events that took place in the community during the initial phases of the
      pandemic. RESULTS: In Washington State, the first week of March started with 4
      confirmed cases and ended with 150; by the end of the second week of March there 
      were more than 700 cases of confirmed COVID-19. During the first week, blood
      donations dropped significantly. Blood units provided from blood centers of
      non-affected areas of the country helped keep inventory stable and allow for
      routine hospital operations. The hospital-based transfusion service began
      prospective triaging of blood orders to monitor and prioritize blood utilization.
      In the second week, blood donations recovered, and the hospital postponed
      elective procedures to ensure staff and personal protective equipment were
      appropriate for the care of critical patients. CONCLUSION: As community
      activities are disrupted and hospital activities switch from routine operations
      to pandemic-focused and urgent care-oriented, the blood supply and utilization
      requires a number of transformations.

LID - 10.1007/s11684-020-0753-1 [doi]
AB  - The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen and is threatening
      the global health. Strikingly, more than 28 000 cases and 550 deaths have been
      reported within two months from disease emergence. Armed with experience from
      previous epidemics in the last two decades, clinicians, scientists, officials,
      and citizens in China are all contributing to the prevention of further 2019-nCoV
      transmission. Efficient preliminary work has enabled us to understand the basic
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV, but there are still many unanswered questions. It
      is too early now to judge our performance in this outbreak. Continuous and
      strengthened efforts should be made not only during the epidemic, but also
      afterwards in order to prepare for any incoming challenges.

TI  - Profiling Early Humoral Response to Diagnose Novel Coronavirus Disease
      (COVID-19).
LID - ciaa310 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major
      healthcare threat. Current method of detection involves qPCR-based technique,
      which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity.
      False negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected
      patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission. We here
      aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019
      novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to 
      diagnose COVID-19. METHODS: The host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2
      including IgA, IgM and IgG response were examined by using an ELISA based assay
      on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein. Total 208 plasma samples were
      collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases (qPCR negative but had typical 
      manifestation). The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort.
      RESULTS: The median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection were 5 days (IQR
      3-6), while IgG was detected on 14 days (IQR 10-18) after symptom onset, with a
      positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7% and 77.9% respectively. In confirmed and probable
      cases, the positive rates of IgM antibodies were 75.6% and 93.1%, respectively.
      The detection efficiency by IgM ELISA is higher than that of qPCR method after
      5.5 days of symptom onset. The positive detection rate is significantly increased
      (98.6%) when combined IgM ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compare with a
      single qPCR test (51.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid to 
      the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) outbreak in
      Wuhan, China, has now spread to many countries across the world including the UK 
      with over 3000 deaths as of early March 2020. This will inevitably lead to an
      increase in the number of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related
      deaths at autopsy. The Royal College of Pathologists has responded to this
      concern with the release of guidelines on autopsy practice relating to COVID-19. 
      The following article is a summary and interpretation of these guidelines. It
      includes a description of hazard group 3 organisms to which SARS-CoV-2 has been
      assigned, a brief description of what is currently known about the pathological
      and autopsy findings in COVID-19, a summary of the recommendations for conducting
      autopsies in suspected COVID-19 cases and the techniques for making the diagnosis
      at autopsy. It concludes by considering the clinicopathological correlation and
      notification of such cases.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a zoonotic viral infection originating
      from Wuhan, China in December 2019. The World Health Organization has classified 
      this pandemic as a global health emergency due to its virulent nature of
      transmission, which may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Singapore's 
      health ministry has responded with enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 for all
      suspected pneumonia cases, further increasing the volume of testing via real-time
      reverse transcription PCR, as well as samples necessitating stringent infectious 
      control. Collectively, this has implications on the total testing process,
      laboratory operations and its personnel due to biosafety concerns. Turnaround
      time for routine testing may also be affected. The aim of this article is to
      present our tertiary institution's early experience with managing this emerging
      crisis and offer practical considerations for the preanalytical, analytical and
      postanalytical phases of laboratory testing in this cohort of patients.

AB  - Patients with COVID-19 infection are at risk of acute respiratory disease
      syndrome (ARDS) and death. The tissue receptor for COVID-19 is ACE2, and higher
      levels of ACE2 can protect against ARDS. Angiotensin receptor blockers and
      statins upregulate ACE2. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether this
      drug combination might be used to treat patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified 
      on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting 
      in 6,284 cases including 42 deaths as of March 6, 2020. To examine the growth
      rate of the outbreak, we aimed to present the first study to report the
      reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS: The daily confirmed
      cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. 
      By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the
      generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on
      the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval. RESULTS: We 
      identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% 
      CI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95%
      CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI:
      0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case
      fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and
      increases with older age. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate early sustained
      transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social 
      distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.

AB  - In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health and health Commission (Hubei
      Province, China) reported a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology. On 
      January 7, 2020, the Chinese authorities identified as a causative agent of the
      outbreak a new type of virus of the Coronaviridiae family, called SARS-CoV-2.
      Since then, thounsands of cases have been reported with global dissemination.
      Infections in humans cause a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild upper
      respiratory tract infection, to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and
      sepsis. There is not specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2, which is why the
      fundamental aspects are to establish adequate prevention measures and support
      treatment and management of complications.

TI  - Coronaviruses and immunosuppressed patients. The facts during the third epidemic.
LID - 10.1002/lt.25756 [doi]
AB  - Following the outbreak in China, the Lombardy region of Italy has become one of
      the areas of highest incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). As the outbreak grew to a pandemic, many centres worldwide raised
      the concern that immunocompromised patients may be at high risk of developing a
      severe respiratory disease called COVID-19. Unlike common viral agents (such as
      Adenovirus, Rhinovirus, Norovirus, Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus),
      Coronaviruses have not shown to cause a more severe disease in immunosuppressed
      patients. For this family of viruses the host innate immune response appears the 
      main driver of lung tissue damage during infection.

TI  - The clinical characteristics of pneumonia patients co-infected with 2019 novel
      coronavirus and influenza virus in Wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25781 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection emerged in Wuhan,
      China on December 2019. Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has
      been spreading quickly and many countries and territories have been affected,
      with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Influenza virus has
      been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia. It was
      found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and
      influenza virus. 5 out of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also
      diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and 
      two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical
      characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19 as well as
      influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (5 [100%]
      patients), Cough (5 [100%] patients), shortness of breath (5 [100%] patients),
      nasal tampon (3 [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (3 [60%] patients), myalgia (2
      [40%] patients), fatigue (2 [40%] patients), headache (2 [40%] patients), and
      expectoration (2 [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to 
      the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (4 [80%] patients), and
      liver function ALT and AST (2 [40%] patients, 2 [40%] patients) and C-reactive
      protein (4 [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital. They stayed 
      in hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4+/-7.02), respectively. The main
      complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1
      [20%] patients), acute liver injury (3 [60%] patients), and diarrhea (2 [40%]
      patients). All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir),
      oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics. Three patients were treated with
      glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five 
      patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all
      patients did not need ICU care and were discharged from hospital without death.
      In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection
      did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory
      findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical
      characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only. However, it is
      worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone
      to appear for those co-infection patients. This article is protected by

AB  - In 2014, the worst outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) emerged in sub-Saharan
      Africa (SSA) causing fear and panic. The outbreak which started in Guinea quickly
      moved across to Sierra Leone and Liberia. With an average EVD case fatality rate 
      of around 50% (range 25-90%), there were many casualties, and the number of
      recorded deaths exceeded 11,300 by June 2016.(1) This article is protected by

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused
      by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has
      recently spread worldwide and been declared a pandemic. We aim to describe here
      the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases.
      METHODS: Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected
      and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and 
      radiological images are discussed. RESULTS: The clinical course of the eleven
      cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical
      presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients 
      with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of
      the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing 
      of virus specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for
      diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct
      symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia
      were more severe. CONCLUSION: All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 
      should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict
      quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide clinical management guidelines for novel coronavirus
      (COVID-19) in pregnancy. METHODS: On February 5, 2020, a multidisciplinary
      teleconference comprising Chinese physicians and researchers was held and medical
      management strategies of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy were discussed. RESULTS:
      Ten key recommendations were provided for the management of COVID-19 infections
      in pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is no clear evidence regarding optimal
      delivery timing, the safety of vaginal delivery, or whether cesarean delivery
      prevents vertical transmission at the time of delivery; therefore, route of
      delivery and delivery timing should be individualized based on obstetrical
      indications and maternal-fetal status.

      Art.
PG  - 1-26
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1745095 [doi]
AB  - The three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus (HCoV) infections
      at the beginning of 21st century have highlighted the necessity for readily
      available, accurate and fast diagnostic testing methods. The laboratory
      diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially,
      with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests
      for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and
      specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This
      presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing
      coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak
      going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of 
      purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method
      used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some
      infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy.
      Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of 
      the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasal-pharynx increases. Several integrated, 
      random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development
      for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These assays are
      simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing 
      the burden of identifying and treating patients.

TI  - Seasonality of Respiratory Viral Infections.
LID - 10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445 [doi]
AB  - The seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases has been widely recognized for
      thousands of years, as annual epidemics of the common cold and influenza disease 
      hit the human population like clockwork in the winter season in temperate
      regions. Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during
      the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory
      viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major
      contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human
      behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on
      respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research
      highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature
      and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses
      to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how
      outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory
      infections. We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality
      of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field. Expected
      final online publication date for the Annual Review of Virology, Volume 7 is

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with droplets and contact
      as the main means of transmission. Since the first case appeared in Wuhan, China,
      in December 2019, the outbreak has gradually spread nationwide. Up to now,
      according to official data released by the Chinese health commission, the number 
      of newly diagnosed patients has been declining, and the epidemic is gradually
      being controlled. Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis
      after infection, some patients developed severe and die from multiple organ
      complications. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans remains
      unclear. Immune function is a strong defense against invasive pathogens and there
      is currently no specific antiviral drug against the virus. This article reviews
      the immunological changes of coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and other viral
      pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV-2. Combined with the published literature, the
      potential pathogenesis of COVID-19 is inferred, and the treatment recommendations
      for giving high-doses intravenous immunoglobulin and low-molecular-weight heparin
      anticoagulant therapy to severe type patients are proposed.

TI  - Recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment of the emerging
      SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in haemodialysis centres.
LID - gfaa069 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfaa069 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, is a major global human threat
      that has turned into a pandemic. This novel coronavirus has specifically high
      morbidity in the elderly and in comorbid populations. Uraemic patients on
      dialysis combine an intrinsic fragility and a very frequent burden of
      comorbidities with a specific setting in which many patients are repeatedly
      treated in the same area (haemodialysis centres). Moreover, if infected, the
      intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further
      complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting
      healthcare systems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures
      to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high
      incidence rates must be taken very seriously. The aim of the present review of
      the European Dialysis (EUDIAL) Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide
      recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis
      centres of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The management of patients on dialysis
      affected by COVID-19 must be carried out according to strict protocols to
      minimize the risk for other patients and personnel taking care of these patients.
      Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation and distribution have
      been shown to be efficient in similar settings. They are essential in the
      management of the pandemic and should be taken in the early stages of the
      disease.

      preventing infection and progression.
LID - dkaa114 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkaa114 [doi]
AB  - A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has 
      swept across 31 provinces in China and over 40 countries worldwide. The
      transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is
      highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release. There is an urgent need
      to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a
      promising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe
      side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an
      antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better
      therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of
      COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has 
      a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is
      cheaper and more readily available in China. We herein strongly urge that
      clinical trials are performed to assess the preventive effects of HCQ in both
      disease infection and progression.

AB  - Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) findings of 5 cases of the
      novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from patients outside of
      Wuhan were reviewed. The human-to-human transmission of the virus may explain the
      infection of the disease outside of Wuhan. CT examination is important in the
      early detection and follow-up of the disease. With a history of exposure or
      travelling, symptoms of fever and cough, and the typical CT manifestation such as
      ground-glass opacity with a peripheral distribution, we should also think of the 
      possibility of the COVID-19 pneumonia in patients outside of Wuhan.

TI  - Response of Chinese Anesthesiologists to the COVID-19 Outbreak.
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000003300 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019, named COVID-19 officially by the World Health
      Organization (Geneva, Switzerland) on February 12, 2020, has spread at
      unprecedented speed. After the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, Chinese
      anesthesiologists encountered increasing numbers of infected patients since
      December 2019. Because the main route of transmission is via respiratory droplets
      and close contact, anesthesia providers are at a high risk when responding to the
      devastating mass emergency. So far, actions have been taken including but not
      limited to nationwide actions and online education regarding special procedures
      of airway management, oxygen therapy, ventilation support, hemodynamic
      management, sedation, and analgesia. As the epidemic situation has lasted for
      months (thus far), special platforms have also been set up to provide free mental
      health care to all anesthesia providers participating in acute and critical
      caring for COVID-19 patients. The current article documents the actions taken,
      lesson learned, and future work needed.

TI  - Perioperative Management of Patients Infected with the Novel Coronavirus:
      Recommendation from the Joint Task Force of the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology
      and the Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists.

AB  - The outbreak of the new Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has been involved in
      77,262 cases in China as well as in 27 other countries as of February 24, 2020.
      Because the virus is novel to human beings, and there is no vaccine yet
      available, every individual is susceptible and can become infected. Healthcare
      workers are at high risk, and unfortunately, more than 3,000 healthcare workers
      in China have been infected. Anesthesiologists are among healthcare workers who
      are at an even higher risk of becoming infected because of their close contact
      with infected patients and high potential of exposure to respiratory droplets or 
      aerosol from their patients' airways. In order to provide healthcare workers with
      updated recommendations on the management of patients in the perioperative
      setting as well as for emergency airway management outside of the operating room,
      the two largest anesthesia societies, the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology (CSA)
      and the Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists (CAA) have formed a task force
      to produce the recommendations. The task force hopes to help healthcare workers, 
      particularly anesthesiologists, optimize the care of their patients and protect
      patients, healthcare workers, and the public from becoming infected. The
      recommendations were created mainly based on the practice and experience of
      anesthesiologists who provide care to patients in China. Therefore, adoption of
      these recommendations outside of China must be done with caution, and the local
      environment, culture, uniqueness of the healthcare system, and patients' needs
      should be considered. The task force will continuously update the recommendations
      and incorporate new information in future versions.

AB  - Healthcare systems worldwide are responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019
      (COVID-19), an emerging infectious syndrome caused by the Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Patients with COVID-19 can
      progress from asymptomatic or mild illness to hypoxemic respiratory failure or
      multisystem organ failure, necessitating intubation and intensive care
      management. Healthcare providers, and particularly anesthesiologists, are at the 
      frontline of this epidemic, and they need to be aware of the best available
      evidence to guide therapeutic management of patients with COVID-19 and to keep
      themselves safe while doing so. Here, the authors review COVID-19 pathogenesis,
      presentation, diagnosis, and potential therapeutics, with a focus on management
      of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. The authors draw on literature from
      other viral epidemics, treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and
      recent publications on COVID-19, as well as guidelines from major health
      organizations. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the evidence
      currently available to guide management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

LID - 10.1038/s41421-020-0153-3 [doi]
AB  - Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as
      SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However,
      there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug
      repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing
      drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug
      discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing
      methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, 
      quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in
      the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV
      whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide
      sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and
      nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved
      regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared 
      to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host
      interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV
      repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are
      further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced
      transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential
      drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus
      melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the "Complementary Exposure"
      pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target
      separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study
      offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate
      repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting
      2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Social Capital and Sleep Quality in Individuals Who Self-Isolated for 14 Days
      During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in January 2020 in China.
PG  - e923921
LID - 10.12659/MSM.923921 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND From the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      began to spread in central China. Social capital is a measure of social trust,
      belonging, and participation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of
      social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who
      self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in
      central China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home
      for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third
      day of isolation. Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal
      Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the
      Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the
      Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was
      performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social
      capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson's correlation
      analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS Low levels of social
      capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but
      increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased
      quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality,
      and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social 
      capital on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS During a period of individual
      self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased
      social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress.

AB  - Outside the Hubei province, China, the mild form of infection and the progressive
      recover of the COVID-19 patients suggest the intervention of "unconventional"
      biological mechanisms worthy of attention. Based on the high-homology between the
      Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we hypothesized
      that past contact with infected dogs shield humans against the circulating
      SARS-CoV-2. Elseways, the recurrent virus exposure over a short time-lapse might 
      result in the Antibody Dependent Enhancement, triggering the violent immune
      reaction responsible for the severe clinical outcomes observed in the Hubei
      province. Nevertheless, further experimental studies are desired for a
      confidential evaluation of the postulated hypotheses.

AB  - The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, 
      China has now spread to many countries worldwide. Current epidemiologic knowledge
      suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits
      opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the
      children's contribution to viral spread in the community. Here, we report the
      first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. The 10-year-old girl was a close
      contact of her uncle and her mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19. In this 
      report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require
      antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens.
      Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal strategy of self-quarantine and patient 
      care in a negative isolation room for children.

AB  - As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is ongoing, the number of
      individuals to be tested for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing. For safe and
      efficient screening for COVID-19, drive-through (DT) screening centers have been 
      designed and implemented in Korea. Herein, we present the overall concept,
      advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 DT screening centers. The steps of
      the DT centers include registration, examination, specimen collection, and
      instructions. The entire service takes about 10 minutes for one testee without
      leaving his or her cars. Increased testing capacity over 100 tests per day and
      prevention of cross-infection between testees in the waiting space are the major 
      advantages, while protection of staff from the outdoor atmosphere is challenging.
      It could be implemented in other countries to cope with the global COVID-19
      outbreak and transformed according to their own situations.

TI  - Clinical features of severe pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in
      Wuhan: a single center's observational study.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-020-00354-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by
      SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China. People of all ages are
      susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients 
      with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of
      severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included eight severe or
      critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit
      (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected
      information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory
      findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. 
      RESULTS: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years;
      six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever
      (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven 
      patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or 
      increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin
      and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other
      findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3
      (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-gamma (2/8).
      Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two
      critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February
      24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five
      recovered and were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of severe
      pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by
      fever and cough. Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and 
      ground-glass opacity; and a cytokine storm was found in these patients, which
      appeared more serious in critically ill patients.

TI  - Chest CT manifestations of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a pictorial
      review.
LID - 10.1007/s00330-020-06801-0 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, first reported in Wuhan, China, has
      rapidly swept around the world just within a month, causing global public health 
      emergency. In diagnosis, chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations can
      supplement parts of limitations of real-time reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Based on a comprehensive literature review and the
      experience in the frontline, we aim to review the typical and relatively atypical
      CT manifestations with representative COVID-19 cases at our hospital, and hope to
      strengthen the recognition of these features with radiologists and help them make
      a quick and accurate diagnosis.Key Points * Ground glass opacities,
      consolidation, reticular pattern, and crazy paving pattern are typical CT
      manifestations of COVID-19. * Emerging atypical CT manifestations, including
      airway changes, pleural changes, fibrosis, nodules, etc., were demonstrated in
      COVID-19 patients. * CT manifestations may associate with the progression and
      prognosis of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a
      tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in
      Singapore in February, 2020. METHODS: We gathered epidemiological and clinical
      data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient
      medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and
      possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported
      the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: As of Feb 15, 2020,
      36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of
      circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were
      quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected
      individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food)
      could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR
      3-6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 
      days. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and
      local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from
      China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions.
      Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of
      widespread transmission in the community. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Human Metapneumovirus.
PG  - 75-76
AB  - The novel coronavirus (now called SARS-CoV-2) initially discovered in Wuhan,
      China, has now become a global pandemic. We describe a patient presenting to an
      Emergency Department in Rhode Island on March 12, 2020 with cough and shortness
      of breath after a trip to Jamaica. The patient underwent nasopharyngeal swab for 
      a respiratory pathogen panel as well as SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. When the respiratory
      pathogen panel was positive for human metapneumovirus, the patient was treated
      and discharged. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR came back positive 24 hours later. Although
      respiratory viral co-infection is thought to be relatively uncommon in adults,
      this case reflects that SARS-CoV-2 testing algorithms that exclude patients who
      test positive for routine viral pathogens may miss SARS-CoV-2 co-infected
      patients.

AB  - Switzerland is among the countries with the highest number of coronavirus
      disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases per capita in the world. There are likely many
      people with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection because testing efforts are currently
      not detecting all infected people, including some with clinical disease
      compatible with COVID-19. Testing on its own will not stop the spread of
      SARS-CoV-2. Testing is part of a strategy. The World Health Organization
      recommends a combination of measures: rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of 
      cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts. In
      this article, we explain why the testing strategy in Switzerland should be
      strengthened urgently, as a core component of a combination approach to control
      COVID-19.

AB  - Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected
      pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for
      diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive
      patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image
      findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with
      mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women,
      with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered
      condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was
      higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). 
      The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival
      group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of
      ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and
      central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score
      of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12
      (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P =
      0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a 
      CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the
      prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with 
      chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground
      glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined
      peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly
      involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.

PG  - 307-311
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm6911e1 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in
      December 2019, and has since spread globally, resulting in >95,000 confirmed
      COVID-19 cases worldwide by March 5, 2020 (1). Singapore adopted a multipronged
      surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical
      consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19,
      enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with
      pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible
      infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and
      deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion
      (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case
      definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients. Containment measures,
      including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border
      controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize
      disease spread. As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been
      identified in Singapore. This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in 
      Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment
      measures. COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they
      were detected. Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 
      73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by
      laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion. Effectiveness of
      these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the
      interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which
      indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19
      cases. Rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts,
      and active monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing
      expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing 
      outbreaks.

LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm6911e2 [doi]
AB  - An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among passengers and crew on a
      cruise ship led to quarantine of approximately 3,700 passengers and crew that
      began on February 3, 2020, and lasted for nearly 4 weeks at the Port of Yokohama,
      Japan (1). By February 9, 20 cases had occurred among the ship's crew members. By
      the end of quarantine, approximately 700 cases of COVID-19 had been
      laboratory-confirmed among passengers and crew. This report describes findings
      from the initial phase of the cruise ship investigation into COVID-19 cases among
      crew members during February 4-12, 2020.

TI  - Natural small molecules as inhibitors of coronavirus lipid-dependent attachment
      to host cells: a possible strategy for reducing SARS-COV-2 infectivity?
PG  - 161-164
LID - 10.23750/abm.v91i1.9402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral infectivity depends on interactions between components of the
      host cell plasma membrane and the virus envelope. Here we review strategies that 
      could help stem the advance of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
      focus on the role of lipid structures, such as lipid rafts and cholesterol,
      involved in the process, mediated by endocytosis, by which viruses attach to and 
      infect cells. Previous studies have shown that many naturally derived substances,
      such as cyclodextrin and sterols, could reduce the infectivity of many types of
      viruses, including the coronavirus family, through interference with
      lipid-dependent attachment to human host cells. CONCLUSIONS: Certain molecules
      prove able to reduce the infectivity of some coronaviruses, possibly by
      inhibiting viral lipid-dependent attachment to host cells. More research into
      these molecules and methods would be worthwhile as it could provide insights the 
      mechanism of transmission of SARS-COV-2 and, into how they could become a basis
      for new antiviral strategies.

      coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic (1). At a news briefing , WHO
      Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted that over the past 2
      weeks, the number of cases outside China increased 13-fold and the number of
      countries with cases increased threefold. Further increases are expected. He said
      that the WHO is "deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and
      severity and by the alarming levels of inaction," and he called on countries to
      take action now to contain the virus. "We should double down," he said. "We
      should be more aggressive." [...].

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated to COVID-19 and sustained by the severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the latest biological
      hazard to assume the relevance of insidious worldwide threat. One obvious
      question that is now engaging the minds of many scientists and healthcare
      professionals is whether and eventually how laboratory medicine could efficiently
      contribute to counteract this and other (future) viral outbreaks. Despite there
      being evidence that laboratory tests are vital throughout many clinical pathways,
      there are at least three major areas where in vitro diagnostics can also provide 
      essential contributions to diagnostic reasoning and managed care of patients with
      suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include etiological diagnosis,
      patient monitoring, as well as epidemiologic surveillance. Nonetheless, some
      structural and practical aspects may generate substantial hurdles in providing
      timely and efficient response to this infectious emergency, which basically
      include inadequate (insufficient) environment and shortage of technical and human
      resources for facing enhanced volume of tests on many infected patients, some of 
      whom are with severe disease. Some proactive and reactive strategies may hence be
      identified to confront this serious healthcare challenge, which entail major
      investments on conventional laboratory resources, reinforcement of regional
      networks of clinical laboratories, installation of mobile laboratories, as well
      as being proactive in establishing laboratory emergency plans.

AB  - Background Coronavirus disease has widely spread all over the world since the
      beginning of 2020. It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of
      COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect
      COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performances. Materials and Methods In
      this retrospective and multi-center study, a deep learning model, COVID-19
      detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from 
      volumetric chest CT exams for the detection of COVID-19. Community acquired
      pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia CT exams were included to test the
      robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from 6 hospitals between
      August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and
      specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4356 chest CT exams from 
      3,322 patients. The average age is 49+/-15 years and there were slightly more
      male patients than female (1838 vs 1484; p-value=0.29). The per-exam sensitivity 
      and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 114 of 127
      (90% [95% CI: 83%, 94%]) and 294 of 307 (96% [95% CI: 93%, 98%]), respectively,
      with an AUC of 0.96 (p-value<0.001). The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for
      detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175) and 92% (239 of
      259), respectively, with an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusions A deep 
      learning model can accurately detect COVID-19 and differentiate it from community
      acquired pneumonia and other lung diseases.

AB  - The evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic(1) is certainly cause
      for concern. Proper communication and optimal decision-making is an ongoing
      challenge, as data evolve. The challenge is compounded, however, by exaggerated
      information. This can lead to inappropriate actions. It is important to
      differentiate promptly the true epidemic from an epidemic of false claims and
      potentially harmful actions.

TI  - A doubt of multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy: a preliminary overview.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25773 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of the novel beta Coronavirus, recently renamed as severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, has raised serious concerns due
      to the virus rapid dissemination worldwide. Nevertheless, there is limited
      information about the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Italy
      from surveillance studies. The shortage of complete genomic sequences available
      impairs our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 introduction and establishment in the
      country. To better understand its dynamics in Italy, we analysed complete genomes
      of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, obtained directly from clinical samples. Our phylogenetic
      reconstructions suggest possible multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2. Continued
      genomic surveillance strategies are needed to improve monitoring and
      understanding of the currently SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, which might help to
      attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases. This article is protected

TI  - Alert for non-respiratory symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      patients in epidemic period: A case report of familial cluster with three
      asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25776 [doi]
AB  - At present, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rampaging around the world.
      However, asymptomatic carriers intensified the difficulty of prevention and
      management. Here we reported the screening, clinical feathers, and treatment
      process of a family cluster involving three COVID-19 patients. The discovery of
      the first asymptomatic carrier in this family cluster depends on the repeated and
      comprehensive epidemiological investigation by disease control experts. In
      addition, the combination of multiple detection methods can help clinicians find 
      asymptomatic carriers as early as possible. In conclusion, the prevention and
      control experience of this family cluster showed that comprehensive rigorous
      epidemiological investigation and combination of multiple detection methods were 
      of great value for the detection of hidden asymptomatic carriers. This article is

LID - 10.1007/s11604-020-00945-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of CT characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia might be helpful
      to the early diagnosis and treatment of patients, and to control the spread of
      infection. METHODS: The chest CT images of the patient were collected to describe
      the CT manifestations and characteristics, and they were compared with the
      previous studies. RESULTS: Multiple patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were
      seen in bilateral lung, mostly in subpleural areas. They progressed within 3
      days, and nodular GGOs were also seen together with subpleural patchy GGOs.
      CONCLUSION: Our case of COVID-19 pneumonia showed multiple subpleural GGOs in
      bilateral lung, rapid progression, and it also accompanied nodular GGOs on chest 
      CT. These findings were consistent with the previous reports, and they might be
      useful for early detection and evaluation of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019,
      requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global
      threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are 
      built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and
      decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19
      outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However,
      unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools
      are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models
      that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of
      the paper.

AB  - The current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reached Germany. The
      majority of people infected present with mild disease, but there are severe cases
      that need intensive care. Unlike other acute infectious diseases progressing to
      sepsis, the severe courses of COVID19 seemingly show prolonged progression from
      onset of first symptoms to life-threatening deterioration of (primarily) lung
      function. Diagnosis relies on PCR using specimens from the respiratory tract.
      Severe ARDS reflects the hallmark of a critical course of the disease. Preventing
      nosocomial infections (primarily by correct use of personal protective equipment)
      and maintenance of hospitals' operational capability are of utmost importance.
      Departments of Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and emergency medicine will envisage
      major challenges.

TI  - Analysis of COVID-19 infection spread in Japan based on stochastic transition
      model.
LID - 10.5582/bst.2020.01482 [doi]
AB  - To assess the effectiveness of response strategies of avoiding large gatherings
      or crowded areas and to predict the spread of COVID-19 infections in Japan, we
      developed a stochastic transmission model by extending the
      Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model with an additional
      modeling of the individual action on whether to stay away from the crowded areas.
      The population were divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected,
      Removed. Susceptible transitions to Infected every hour with a probability
      determined by the ratio of Infected and the congestion of area. The total area
      consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different
      infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. The
      time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 
      and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly. This
      simulation showed that the number of Infected and Removed will increase rapidly
      if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone. On the other hand,
      the stagnant growth of Infected can be observed when the time spent in the
      crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of Infected will
      decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent
      in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours. In conclusions The infection
      spread in Japan will be gradually contained by reducing the time spent in the
      crowded zone to less than 4 hours.

AB  - The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) from the Hubei province in China in late 2019 demonstrates the
      epidemic potential of coronaviruses. The rapid spread of this virus across the
      world in only 2 months highlights the transmissibility of this family of viruses 
      and the significant morbidity and mortality that they can cause. We highlight the
      current state of knowledge of coronavirus biology while answering questions
      concerning the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Insight into COVID-2019 for pediatricians.
LID - 10.1002/ppul.24734 [doi]
AB  - Since December 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia have been found in Wuhan
      City, Hubei Province, China. The pathogen in these cases is a new type of
      coronavirus. The World Health Organization confirmed this diagnosis and named the
      pathogen SARSCoV-2. The disease caused by SARSCoV-2 is called Corona Virus
      Disease (COVID-2019). The virus is highly infectious and pathogenic, causing
      human-to-human transmission. At present, SARSCoV-2 is still rampant in the world.
      Zhengzhou City in Henan Province serves as an example, 102 people have been
      confirmed to be infected with SARSCoV-2 (at 24:00 on February 5th, 2020),
      including three children, the youngest is 4 years old. From the perspective of
      clinical pediatricians as the first line fighting the epidemic, this paper will
      discuss the clinical characteristics, prevention and control measures, outcomes, 
      diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric cases.

TI  - Identifying and Interrupting Superspreading Events-Implications for Control of
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.
LID - 10.3201/eid2606.200495 [doi]
AB  - It appears inevitable that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will
      continue to spread. Although we still have limited information on the
      epidemiology of this virus, there have been multiple reports of superspreading
      events (SSEs), which are associated with both explosive growth early in an
      outbreak and sustained transmission in later stages. Although SSEs appear to be
      difficult to predict and therefore difficult to prevent, core public health
      actions can prevent and reduce the number and impact of SSEs. To prevent and
      control of SSEs, speed is essential. Prevention and mitigation of SSEs depends,
      first and foremost, on quickly recognizing and understanding these events,
      particularly within healthcare settings. Better understanding transmission
      dynamics associated with SSEs, identifying and mitigating high-risk settings,
      strict adherence to healthcare infection prevention and control measures, and
      timely implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions can help prevent and
      control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, as well as future
      infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that
      emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries
      worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus
      (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no 
      licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the
      efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S 
      protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates 
      have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized
      animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection.
      This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics
      to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made 
      with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt
      this emerging virus infection.

      Pneumonia: A Preliminary Analysis.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.23072 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations 
      and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women 
      and to provide some initial evidence that can be used for guiding treatment of
      pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the
      clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 
      pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020. A
      semiquantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate pulmonary involvement and
      the time course of changes on chest CT. Symptoms and laboratory results were
      analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were
      tracked. RESULTS. Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries
      and one vaginal delivery) during the study period, and four patients were still
      pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the
      end of the study period. No cases of neonatal asphyxia, neonatal death,
      stillbirth, or abortion were reported. The most common early finding on chest CT 
      was ground-glass opacity (GGO). With disease progression, crazy paving pattern
      and consolidations were seen on CT. The abnormalities showed absorptive changes
      at the end of the study period for all patients. The most common onset symptoms
      of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were fever (13/15 patients) and cough
      (9/15 patients). The most common abnormal laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia 
      (12/15 patients). CT images obtained before and after delivery showed no signs of
      pneumonia aggravation after delivery. The four patients who were still pregnant
      at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had
      achieved good recovery. CONCLUSION. Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate
      the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia. All the cases of
      COVID-19 pneumonia in the pregnant women in our study were the mild type. All the
      women in this study-some of whom did not receive antiviral drugs-achieved good
      recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - Information on severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (transmissibility,
      disease seriousness, impact) is crucial for preparation of healthcare sectors. We
      present a simple approach to assess disease seriousness, creating a reference
      cohort of pneumonia patients from sentinel hospitals. First comparisons exposed a
      higher rate of COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation. There were more case
      fatalities among COVID-19 patients without comorbidities than in the reference
      cohort. Hospitals should prepare for high utilisation of ventilation and
      intensive care resources.

AB  - Severe and critical coronavirus pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19) often occurs in elder
      patients with multiple comorbidities, and severe hypoxemia events are an
      important factor in the deterioration of some cases. The critical type of
      COVID-19 could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ
      dysfunction, which are the most important causes of death. Early start with
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) against the possible physiological abnormalities
      could be helpful to improve prognosis. Close monitoring of oxygenation, reducing 
      patients' oxygen consumption, active psychological intervention, and rapidly
      dealing with severe hypoxemia events are the key factors for the successful
      treatment of NIV. In addition, active adjuvant therapy is also important, such as
      correcting coagulation dysfunction, providing proper nutritional support,
      accurate volume control, and safe individualized blood glucose monitoring and
      control.

AB  - Objective: Analyzing the symptom characteristics of Coronavirus Disease
      2019(COVID-19) to improve its prevention. Methods: Using Baidu Index Platform
      (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control
      and Prevention as data resources to obtain the search volume (SV) of keywords for
      symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from
      2017 to 2020, in Hubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in China and 
      the epidemic data. Data of 2020 were compared with the previous three years. Data
      of Hubei province were compared with confirmed cases. The differences and
      characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation
      between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and
      the hysteresis effects were discussed. Results: Compared the data from January 1 
      to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years,
      Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other
      symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms
      was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001). The
      SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with new confirmed 
      or suspected cases (R(confirmed) = 0.723, R(suspected) = 0.863, all P < 0.001).
      The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who
      retrieved relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days
      later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. Conclusions: The total SV of lower
      respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the
      SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. It warns us to pay attention to not 
      only the symptoms of lower respiratory tract, but also the gastrointestinal
      symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19. There is a relationship 
      between Internet retrieval behavior and the number of new confirmed or suspected 
      cases. Big data has a certain role in the early warning of infectious diseases.

AB  - Crises often drive innovation. The COVID 19 pandemic has led to the necessary
      postponement of much planned surgical activity with the cancellation of
      outpatient, diagnostic and operative work. These measures have been designed to
      'flatten the curve' and delay the spread of coronavirus whilst also freeing up
      capacity within hospitals for patients affected with the virus. This inevitable
      postponement of routine activity will create challenges to health care systems
      when normal business resumes and in many healthcare settings, which are often
      already resource constrained. This will impose an additional burden on patients
      whose diagnoses and treatment will be delayed.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) causes a
      cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. It spread rapidly and globally. CT
      imaging is helpful for the evaluation of the novel coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) pneumonia. Infection control inside the CT suites is also important to
      prevent hospital-related transmission of COVID-19. We present our experience with
      infection control protocol for COVID-19 inside the CT suites.

TI  - Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and
      control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a
      scoping review.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s40249-020-00646-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause
      of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning
      in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries
      with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization 
      has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A
      scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by 
      Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published
      before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the
      epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus.
      The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors'
      affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis.
      All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based
      on published information as listed in the references. RESULTS: Most of the
      publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest
      proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority
      (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused
      on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to
      prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination
      is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations
      have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue,
      pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such 
      as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection,
      contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce
      transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective;
      hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive
      care. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the
      outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily
      explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well 
      as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are
      relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is
      needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health
      emergency in both the short- and long-term.

TI  - Successful recovery of COVID-19 pneumonia in a renal transplant recipient with
      long-term immunosuppression.
LID - 10.1111/ajt.15869 [doi]
AB  - The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised great
      concern worldwide, but its impact on transplant recipients is unknown. We report 
      here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported renal
      transplant recipient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. This is a 52-year-old man
      who received kidney transplantation 12 years ago. His overall clinical
      characteristics (symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT) were similar to
      those of non-transplanted COVID-19 patients. Following a treatment regimen
      consisting of reduced immunosuppressant use and low dose methylprednisolone-based
      therapy, the COVID-19 pneumonia in this long-term immunosuppressive patient was
      successfully recovered. This effectively treated case has reference value for the
      future treatment of other transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - Since December 2019, world healthcare community faced with Coronavirus Disease
      2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2. Due to the high viral
      contagiousness and the possible transmission during the pre-symptomatic phase,
      COVID-19 progressively spread to several countries. Currently, Italy is the third
      Country for number of confirmed cases after mainland China and South Chorea, and 
      the first western nation with a well-established deceased transplant program to
      tackle a COVID-19 outbreak(1) .

TI  - Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with prognosis in patients with Corona
      Virus Disease-19.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25767 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: SinceDecember 2019, novelcoronavirus infected pneumonia emerged in 
      Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. In severe novel coronavirus
      pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the
      treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR)were a concern. We sought to describe
      platelet feature of these cases. METHODS: Single-center case series of the 30
      hospitalized patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease(COVID)-19 in Huizhou
      municipal central hospitalfrom January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively
      analysed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laborotary results 
      and treatment date were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and
      non-severe patients were compared. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that: age,
      platelet peaks and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe
      patients,multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during 
      treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.The average
      hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were longer 
      than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05).The average age of patients with
      platelet peaks during treatment were older than those without platelet
      peaks(P<0.05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during
      treatment had longer average hospitalization day. And the higher PLR of patients 
      during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. CONCLUSION:
      Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19
      in Huizhou municipal central hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and 
      their dynamic changes during the treatment may have suggestion on the severity
      and prognosis of disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer
      average hospitalization day may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of
      patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator 
      in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by

TI  - A guideline for homology modeling of the proteins from newly discovered
      betacoronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25768 [doi]
AB  - During an outbreak of respiratory diseases including atypical pneumonia in Wuhan,
      a previously unknown beta-coronavirus was detected in patients. The newly
      discovered coronavirus is similar to some beta-coronaviruses found in bats, but
      different from previously known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High sequence identities
      and similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV was found. In this work, we
      searched the homologous templates of all nonstructural and structural proteins of
      2019-nCoV. Among the nonstructural proteins, the leader protein (nsp1), the
      papain-like protease (nsp3), the nsp4, the 3C-like protease (nsp5), the nsp7, the
      nsp8, the nsp9, the nsp10, the RNA-directed RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase 
      (nsp13), the guanine-N7 methyltransferase (nsp14), the uridylate-specific
      endoribonuclease (nsp15), the 2'-O-methyltransferase (nsp16), and the ORF7a
      protein could be built on the basis of homology templates. Among the structural
      proteins, the spike protein (S-protein), the envelope protein (E-protein), and
      the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) can be constructed based on the crystal
      structures of the proteins from SARS-CoV. It is known that PL-Pro, 3CL-Pro, and
      RdRp are important targets for design antiviral drugs against 2019-nCoV. And S
      protein is critical target candidate for inhibitor screening or vaccine design
      against 2019-nCoV because coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of 
      S protein to cell surface receptors. It is believed that these proteins should be
      useful for further structure-based virtual screening and related computer-aided
      drug development and vaccine design. This article is protected by copyright. All

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT
      manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective
      study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were
      evaluated. RESULTS. One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range,
      21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever
      in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The 
      laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or
      reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level
      was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one
      lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes
      in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the
      common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had
      ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of 
      lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 
      patients [52%]). Vascular thickening (86 patients [80%]), crazy paving pattern
      (43 patients [40%]), air bronchogram sign (52 patients [48%]), and halo sign (69 
      [64%]) were also observed in this study. CONCLUSION. The early clinical and
      laboratory findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough,
      and fatigue with normal WBC count, reduced lymphocyte count, and elevated
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. The early CT findings are patchy GGO
      with or without consolidation involving multiple lobes, mainly in the peripheral 
      zone, accompanied by halo sign, vascular thickening, crazy paving pattern, or air
      bronchogram sign.

TI  - The positive impact of lockdown in Wuhan on containing the COVID-19 outbreak in
      China.
LID - taaa037 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jtm/taaa037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was
      declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World 
      Health Organization (WHO). Consequently, many countries have implemented flight
      restrictions to China. China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of
      Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province. However, whether these two enormous
      measures have led to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains 
      unclear. METHODS: We analyzed available data on the development of confirmed
      domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after lockdown measures. We 
      evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed
      COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China
      before and after lockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic
      criteria. RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time 
      from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9-2.6), to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5-4.3),
      after imposing lockdown. A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic
      and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1-26.3), respectively. Moreover, the 
      correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker
      following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, p < 0.05 vs. after lockdown: r =
      0.91, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased
      doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown
      measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have 
      a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

TI  - An Analysis of 38 Pregnant Women with COVID-19, Their Newborn Infants, and
      Maternal-Fetal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: Maternal Coronavirus Infections and
      Pregnancy Outcomes.
LID - 10.5858/arpa.2020-0901-SA [doi]
AB  - The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially
      life-threating respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly
      spread across the globe creating a massive public health problem. Previous
      epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor
      obstetrical outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal
      transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death. This communication
      reviews the effects of two previous coronavirus infections - severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory
      syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV - on pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it
      analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns
      in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including
      clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus
      from mother to fetus. This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of
      pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did
      not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS
      and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of
      SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens
      tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for
      SARS-CoV-2. At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is
      no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission
      from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Analysis of additional cases is
      necessary to determine if this remains true.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of different anesthetic regimens for parturients with
      COVID-19 undergoing Cesarean delivery: a case series of 17 patients.
LID - 10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the management and safety of epidural or general anesthesia
      for Cesarean delivery in parturients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and
      their newborns, and to evaluate the standardized procedures for protecting
      medical staff. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients
      diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
      infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed
      tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity
      were evaluated. We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical
      characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal
      complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff.
      RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult
      patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia
      performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of
      the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing
      significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general
      anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three
      of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are
      receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born
      prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All
      neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were
      infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and
      general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with
      COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia
      appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and
      effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from
      COVID-19.

      cluster cases.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-020-00356-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the
      globe. People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19. However, literature
      reports on pediatric patients are limited. METHODS: To improve the recognition of
      COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed
      pediatric cases from two family clusters. Both clinical features and laboratory
      examination results of the children and their family members were described.
      RESULTS: The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or
      gastrointestinal symptoms. Both of them had normal chest CT images. After general
      and symptomatic treatments, both children recovered quickly. Both families had
      travel histories to Hubei Province. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with COVID-19
      are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history. Infected
      children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults. We should
      attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of
      infected children.

AB  - An epidemic caused by SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection has spread unexpectedly in
      Wuhan, Hubei Province, China since December 2019. It is rarely reported about
      asymptomatic cases screened from close contacts. We study epidemiological and
      clinical outcome of 55 asymptomatic carriers who were laboratory-confirmed
      positive for the SARS-Coronavirus-2 by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal
      swab samples. The evidence showed that asymptomatic carriers occurred more often 
      in middle aged people who had close contact with infected family members. The
      majority of the cases developed to be mild and ordinary COVID-19 during hospital.

AB  - Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19) were mainly based on information from adult populations.
      Limited data are available for children with COVID-19, especially for infected
      infants. We report a 55-day-old case with COVID-19 confirmed in China and
      describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the
      patient, including the disease progression from day 7 to day 11 of illness. This 
      case highlights that children with COVID-19 can also present with multiple organ 
      damage and rapid disease changes. When managing such patients, frequent and
      careful clinical monitoring is essential.

AB  - The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global
      public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report
      our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed 
      (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host
      cell adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of 
      spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and
      camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our study
      also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein
      potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for
      hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique features of
      COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread
      rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 100,000 confirmed infections and
      4000 fatalities (as of 10 March 2020). The outbreak has been declared a pandemic 
      by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in
      transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine
      diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic
      coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for
      SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of
      different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show 
      that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate
      regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021.
      Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation
      in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the 
      scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might
      be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but
      do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2
      should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global
      transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection
      control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave
      with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of
      opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: From December 2019 to February 2020, 2019 severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a serious outbreak of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Related clinical features are needed.
      METHODS: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan
      between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020.
      RESULTS: The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0),
      and 32 patients (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]),
      cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy 
      (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).
      As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five
      patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%. According to the lowest SpO2
      during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2>/=90% group (n=55) and the
      SpO2<90% group (n=14). All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2<90% group. Compared with
      SpO2>/=90% group, patients of the SpO2<90% group were older, and showed more
      comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c
      reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging
      rate and decrease the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to show
      frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a 
      mortality rate of 7.5%. Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are
      at higher risk of death.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) epidemic, caused by the severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from China. This virus 
      causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since then, there have been
      anecdotal reports of ocular infection. The ocular implications of human CoV
      infections have not been widely studied. However, CoVs have been known to cause
      various ocular infections in animals. Clinical entities such as conjunctivitis,
      anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis have been documented in feline
      and murine models. In this article, the current evidence suggesting possible
      human CoV infection of ocular tissue is reviewed. The review article will also
      highlight animal CoVs and their associated ocular infections. We hope that this
      article will serve as a start for further research into the ocular implications
      of human CoV infections.

LID - 10.1002/rmv.2103 [doi]
AB  - In response to the recent novel coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, Hubei 
      province, China, observations concerning novel coronavirus mortality are of
      urgent public health importance. The present work presents the first review of
      the fatal novel coronavirus cases in China. Clinical data of fatal cases
      published by the Chinese Government were studied. As of 2 February 2020, the
      clinical data of 46 fatal cases were identified. The case fatality rate was
      significantly higher in Hubei province than the rest of China. While 67% of all
      deceased patients were male, gender was unlikely to be associated with mortality.
      Diabetes was likely to be associated with mortality. There is, however, not yet
      sufficient evidence to support the association between hypertension and mortality
      as similar prevalence of hypertension was also observed in the Hubei population.

AB  - Unexplained pneumonia (UP) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) emerged in China in late December 2019 and
      has infected more than 9000 cases by 31 January 2020. Shanghai reported the first
      imported case of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) in 20 January 2020. A
      combinative approach of real-time RT-PCR, CRISPR-based assay and metagenomic
      next-generation sequencing (mNGS) were used to diagnose this unexplained
      pneumonia patient. Real-time RT-PCR and CRISPR-based assay both reported
      positive. This sample belonged to Betacoronavirus and shared a more than 99%
      nucleotide (nt) identity with the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We further compared 
      pros and cons of common molecular diagnostics in UP. In this study, we
      illustrated the importance of combining molecular diagnostics to rule out common 
      pathogens and performed mNGS to obtain unbiased potential pathogen result for the
      diagnosis of UP.

AB  - The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China in December
      2019 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbroke in Guangzhou,
      China in 2003 were caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses with high homology. 
      Since the 2019 novel coronavirus has strong transmissibility and progress
      rapidly. It has caused negative social effects and massive economic damage on a
      global scale. While there is currently no vaccine or effective drugs. Pulmonary
      fibrosis is a pulmonary disease with progressive fibrosis, which is the main
      factor leading to pulmonary dysfunction and quality of life decline in SARS
      survivors after recovery. Extensive epidemiological, viral immunological, and
      current clinical evidences support the possibility that pulmonary fibrosis may be
      one of the major complications in COVID-19 patients. Although there are no
      reports on the mechanism of COVID-19 inducing pulmonary fibrosis, based on the
      existing theoretical basis, we focus on the possible mechanism of COVID-19
      sustained lung damaging, the key role of abnormal immune mechanism in the
      initiation and promotion of pulmonary fibrosis, and the corresponding therapeutic
      measures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected
      pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China. This
      study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19. 
      METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive
      patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from
      January 1st to February 5th. The cases were divided into general and refractory
      COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the
      difference between groups were compared. RESULTS: Compared with general COVID-19 
      patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying
      comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature
      among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer
      disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower
      levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and 
      pleural effusion (P<0.05). Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to
      receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment
      including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P<0.05). After
      adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male
      sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen,
      expectorant and adjunctive agents (P<0.05) when considering the factors of
      disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.
      CONCLUSION: Nearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and
      radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization. The patients with
      male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the pathological characteristics and the clinical
      significance of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (termed by WHO
      as corona virus disease 2019, COVID-19). Methods: Minimally invasive autopsies
      from lung, heart, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, stomach,
      intestine, thyroid and skin were performed on three patients died of novel
      coronavirus pneumonia in Chongqing, China. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE)
      and histochemical staining were performed to investigate the pathological changes
      of indicated organs or tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to
      evaluate the infiltration of immune cells as well as the expression of 2019-nCoV 
      proteins. Real time PCR was carried out to detect the RNA of 2019-nCoV. Results: 
      Various damages were observed in the alveolar structure, with minor serous
      exudation and fibrin exudation. Hyaline membrane formation was observed in some
      alveoli. The infiltrated immune cells in alveoli were majorly macrophages and
      monocytes. Moderate multinucleated giant cells, minimal lymphocytes, eosinophils 
      and neutrophils were also observed. Most of infiltrated lymphocytes were
      CD4-positive T cells. Significant proliferation of type II alveolar epithelia and
      focal desquamation of alveolar epithelia were also indicated. The blood vessels
      of alveolar septum were congested, edematous and widened, with modest
      infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Hyaline thrombi were found in a
      minority of microvessels. Focal hemorrhage in lung tissue, organization of
      exudates in some alveolar cavities, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosiswere
      observed. Part of the bronchial epithelia were exfoliated. Coronavirus particles 
      in bronchial mucosal epithelia and type II alveolar epithelia were observed under
      electron microscope. Immunohistochemical staining showed that part of the
      alveolar epithelia and macrophages were positive for 2019-nCoV antigen. Real time
      PCR analyses identified positive signals for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Decreased
      numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed in spleen.
      Furthermore, degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells, formation of hyaline
      thrombus in small vessels, and pathological changes of chronic diseases were
      observed in other organs and tissues, while no evidence of coronavirus infection 
      was observed in these organs. Conclusion: s The lungs from novel coronavirus
      pneumonia patients manifest significant pathological lesions, including the
      alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation, alveolar
      epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation. While the 2019-nCoV is
      mainly distributed in lung, the infection also involves in the damages of heart, 
      vessels, liver, kidney and other organs. Further studies are warranted to
      investigate the mechanism underlying pathological changes of this disease.

AB  - A novel zoonotic coronavirus outbreak is spreading all over the world. This
      pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of
      this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential
      RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as
      identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling,
      transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate
      material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual
      errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing
      patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also
      contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the
      diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated
      assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other
      specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for
      minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of
      diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed
      tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to
      epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of
      upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test
      results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear
      instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage,
      together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with
      analytical procedures, including quality assurance.

AB  - Background As the number of patients increases, there is a growing understanding 
      of the form of pneumonia sustained by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2),
      which has caused an outbreak in China. Up to now, clinical features and treatment
      of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail. However, the
      relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our 
      aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect
      blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the
      same period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the 
      control group (p < 0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation
      products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially
      higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in
      patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with
      milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) 
      was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients
      was also shorter than that in controls. Conclusions The coagulation function in
      patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, 
      but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification
      of severe cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have
      generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial
      clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients
      with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included
      confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of
      follow-up was February 25, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the
      median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset
      of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was
      occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been
      discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of
      fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals
      [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to
      intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared
      to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P
      <0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%)
      patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed
      radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative
      reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days
      (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients
      in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis,
      age (Odds ratio [OR]=1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR=0.55 per 100 cells/ul
      increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The
      majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests
      that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy 
      in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general
      population. However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate
      the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. METHODS: Clinical
      records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for
      55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab 
      samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital
      of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020. RESULTS: All 55 
      patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%)
      patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
      Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including
      fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive
      lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56x10(9) cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia
      (from 4.5 to 18.28x10(9) cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented
      normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated
      patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus.
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was
      currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific 
      clinical characteristics to distinguish them.

AB  - Objective: To understand the viral genomic characteristics of a 2019-nCoV strain 
      in the first COVID-19 patient found in Hangzhou, China. Methods: Viral RNA was
      extracted in throat swab and sputum sample of the patient and was performed
      real-time reverse transcription PCR detection and obtained viral genome by
      high-throughput sequencing method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 29
      2019-nCoV genomes and 30 beta-coronavirus genomes deposited in NCBI GenBank.
      Fifteen genomes from Wuhan were grouped by mutation sites and others were
      identified by Wuhan's or specific mutation sites. Results: A 29 833 bp length
      genome of the first 2019-nCoV strain in Hangzhou was obtained, covering full
      length of the coding regions of coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
      the genome was closest to the genome of a bat SARS-like coronavirus strain RaTG13
      with an identity of 96.11% (28 666/29 826). Among the genes between two genomes, 
      E genes were highly conserved (99.56%), while S genes had lowest identity
      (92.87%), suggesting that S gene was of a faster evolutionary rate. The genome
      sequence similarities among 29 strains from China (Hangzhou, Wuhan, and
      Shenzhen), Japan, USA, and Finland, were all more than 99.9%; however, some
      single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in some strains. Conclusion: The 
      genome of Hangzhou 2019-nCoV strain was very close to the genomes of strains from
      other cities in China and overseas collected at early epidemic phase. The
      2019-nCoV genome sequencing method used in this paper provides an useful tool for
      monitoring variation of viral genes.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of the severe or critically
      ill patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), and evaluate the impact
      of complicated myocardial injury on the prognosis of these patients. Methods: A
      retrospective study was conducted in 54 patients who admitted to Tongji hospital 
      from February 3, 2020 to February 24, 2020 and met the criteria of severe or
      critical conditions of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and hospital
      mortality rate were analyzed and compared between the patients with or without
      myocardial injury, which was defined with 3 times higher serum cardiac troponin
      value. Results: The median age of the 54 patients was 68 (59.8, 74.3) years.
      Among all the patients, 24 (44.4%) patients were complicated with hypertension,
      13 (24.1%) with diabetes, 8 (14.8%) with coronary heart disease, and 3 (5.6%)
      with previous cerebral infarction. During hospitalization, 24 (44.4%) of the
      patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26 (48.1%) patients died in 
      hospital. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with
      myocardial injury than in patients without myocardial injury (14 (60.9%) vs. 8
      (25.8%), P=0.013). Moreover, the levels of C-reactive protein (153.6 (80.3,
      240.7) ng/L vs. 49.8 (15.9, 101.9) ng/L) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
      peptide (852.0 (400.0, 2 315.3) ng/L vs. 197.0 (115.3, 631.0) ng/L) were
      significantly higher than patients without myocardial injury (all P<0.01).
      Conclusions: Prevalence of myocardial injury is high among severe or critically
      ill COVID-19 patients. Severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients with myocardial
      injury face a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The study
      suggests that it is important to monitor and manage the myocardial injury during 
      hospitalization for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients.

      patient featured ground-glass opacities and consolidations in both lungs. The
      lung lesions may involute rapidly during the course. The patient showed
      improvement both clinically and on computed tomography imaging at discharged
      after 2 weeks'treatment. Computed tomography scans of patients helped monitor the
      changes continuously, which could timely provide the information of the evolution
      of the disease or therapeutic effect to clinicians.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to
      emerge and represent a serious issue to public health. In the last twenty years, 
      several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most 
      recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first
      identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day,
      an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in
      Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first
      reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019. Published
      literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the
      beginning of December 2019. As they were unable to identify the causative agent, 
      these first cases were classified as "pneumonia of unknown etiology." The Chinese
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an
      intensive outbreak investigation program. The etiology of this illness is now
      attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family. On
      February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,
      announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a "COVID-19," which is the 
      acronym of "coronavirus disease 2019". In the past twenty years, two additional
      coronavirus epidemics have occurred. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic
      beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000
      cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has
      approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases. This
      new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally. In a
      meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR,
      2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four
      countries reporting human-to-human transmission. An additional landmark occurred 
      on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, 
      was recorded in the United States. Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV.
      Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of
      Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one
      that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs). The CoVs have become the major
      pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. They are a large family of
      single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal
      species.[1] For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species
      barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more
      severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. Interestingly, these latter viruses have
      probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts - the
      Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV - before 
      jumping to humans. The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is
      speculation that it also has an animal origin. The potential for these viruses to
      grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk.
      Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the "very
      high" level, on February 28, 2020. Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused
      by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving. On March
      11, as the number of COVID-19 cases outside China has increased 13 times and the 
      number of countries involved has tripled with more than 118,000 cases in 114
      countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. World
      governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating
      effects. Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives 
      and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat. At the same time,
      scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the
      transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and
      prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing. Many uncertainties 
      remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the
      epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its
      peak. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are
      only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community
      is our best weapon. Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to a
      progressive reduction of cases in the last few days. In Italy, in geographic
      regions of the north, initially, and subsequently throughout the peninsula,
      political and health authorities are making incredible efforts to contain a shock
      wave that is severely testing the health system. In the midst of the crisis, the 
      authors have chosen to use the "Statpearls" platform because, within the PubMed
      scenario, it represents a unique tool that may allow them to make updates in
      real-time. The aim, therefore, is to collect information and scientific evidence 
      and to provide an overview of the topic that will be continuously updated.

AB  - Rapidly sharing scientific information is an effective way to reduce public panic
      about COVID-19, and doing so is the key to providing real-time guidance to
      epidemiologists working to contain the outbreak, clinicians managing patients,
      and modelers helping to understand future developments and the possible
      effectiveness of various interventions. This issue has rapidly reviewed and
      published articles describing COVID-19, including the drug treatment options for 
      SARS-CoV-2, its clinical characteristics, and therapies involving a combination
      of Chinese and Western medicine, the efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the
      treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia according to clinical studies, and
      reflections on the system of reserve medical supplies for public health
      emergencies. As an academic journal, we will continue to quickly and
      transparently share data with frontline healthcare workers who need to know the
      epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19.

AB  - In December 2019, China diagnosed the first patient with 2019 novel coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19), and the following development of the epidemic had a huge
      impact on China and the whole world. For patients with lung occupying lesions,
      the whole process of diagnosis and treatment can not be carried out as usual due 
      to the epidemic. For thoracic surgeons, the timing of surgical intervention
      should be very carefully considered. All thoracic surgeons in China should work
      together to develop the proper procedures for the diagnosis and treatment in this
      special situation, and continuously update the recommendations based on epidemic 
      changes and further understanding of COVID-19. Here, we only offer some
      preliminary suggestions based on our own knowledge for further reference and
      discussion.

TI  - Challenges to the system of reserve medical supplies for public health
      emergencies: reflections on the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in China.
PG  - 3-8
LID - 10.5582/bst.2020.01043 [doi]
AB  - On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced an outbreak
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), China is now at 
      a critical period in the control of the epidemic. The Chinese Government has been
      taking a series of rapid, comprehensive, and effective prevention and control
      measures. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a
      serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage 
      of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing.
      This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention
      and control. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to
      quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and 
      it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the
      emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and
      there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency
      medical supplies. A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the 
      management of public health emergencies. Based on international experiences with 
      pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency
      reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public
      health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of
      international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies
      of international concern in the future.

AB  - Pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is continuously 
      and rapidly circulating at present. No effective antiviral treatment has been
      verified thus far. We report here the clinical characteristics and therapeutic
      procedure for four patients with mild or severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia admitted to
      Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. All the patients were given antiviral
      treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra((R))), arbidol, and Shufeng
      Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC, a traditional Chinese medicine) and other necessary support
      care. After treatment, three patients gained significant improvement in pneumonia
      associated symptoms, two of whom were confirmed 2019-nCoV negative and
      discharged, and one of whom was virus negative at the first test. The remaining
      patient with severe pneumonia had shown signs of improvement by the cutoff date
      for data collection. Results obtained in the current study may provide clues for 
      treatment of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The efficacy of antiviral treatment including
      lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC warrants further verification in future
      study.

PG  - 69-71
LID - 10.5582/bst.2020.01020 [doi]
AB  - As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) have been reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China.
      At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal
      coronavirus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible
      is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Three general methods,
      which include existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs using standard assays,
      screening of a chemical library containing many existing compounds or databases, 
      and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical
      understanding of individual coronaviruses, are used to discover the potential
      antiviral treatment of human pathogen coronavirus. Lopinavir /Ritonavir,
      Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1),
      abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs
      (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such
      ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment
      options for 2019-nCoV. However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- 
      nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments.

TI  - Receptor Recognition by the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan: an Analysis Based on
      Decade-Long Structural Studies of SARS Coronavirus.
LID - e00127-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00127-20 [doi]
AB  - Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing 
      symptoms in humans similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural
      analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike
      protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and
      human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential
      receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the
      newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD,
      including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is
      similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its 
      receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly
      Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with
      2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical
      residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not
      ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some
      capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis
      indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2
      from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these
      animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV
      infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, 
      host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic
      surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.IMPORTANCE The recent
      emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is 
      reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural 
      studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions 
      between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting
      enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human
      transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an 
      atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate
      epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify
      potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses. Based on the sequence of
      2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel
      insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This study
      provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic,
      translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights
      that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.
