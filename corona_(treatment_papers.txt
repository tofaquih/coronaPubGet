AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;
      previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease
      (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is 
      a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health
      Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been
      identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China.
      On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health
      emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two
      bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 
      and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or 
      direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period
      of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with
      pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), 
      fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement 
      with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography
      images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is
      responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China.
      Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the
      primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep
      monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus
      and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

AB  - In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and
      later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and
      rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world,
      despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the 
      original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic
      information systems and methods, including, among other application
      possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of
      social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using
      population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and
      contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and
      effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and
      describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and
      applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated
      events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications
      are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of
      them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had
      any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support
      the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.

AB  - The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a
      novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
      There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways
      to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine
      design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between
      SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging
      existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the
      experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the
      immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T 
      cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map
      identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these
      identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21
      February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer
      protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a
      population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of 
      epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in
      China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide
      experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the
      2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is
      caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than
      75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than
      2000 deaths worldwide. Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities 
      were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public
      health emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an
      asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults
      represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates,
      children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition,
      nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral
      transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on 
      chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with
      bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with
      underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity
      may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is 
      lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents,
      including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China. Currently, effective
      infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of
      SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - We prepared the three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 (aka 2019-nCoV) 3C-like
      protease (3CL (pro)) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96%
      identity) ortholog from the SARS-CoV. All residues involved in the catalysis,
      substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the
      polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C-like cleavage sites on
      the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical
      substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that 
      some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV
      enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. With the 3CL (pro)
      molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and
      proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir 
      or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new
      coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache. The drugs
      Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be
      very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes.

      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was
      transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei
      province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date
      (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected
      droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are
      usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others.
      The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with
      comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case
      fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration
      of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common
      laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated
      C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually
      abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially
      supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails
      home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict
      infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet
      precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. 
      The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.

AB  - Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens
      including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 
      and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease
      condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the
      third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The
      continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant
      threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research
      on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to
      treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective 
      vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several
      clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV
      infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help
      scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and
      develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this
      infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for
      passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential
      of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many
      diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic 
      intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the
      neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and
      MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate
      therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging
      pathogen.

AB  - An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2,
      previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
      spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020,
      World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a
      public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2,
      since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third
      introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the
      human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of
      87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of
      China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several
      independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to
      beta-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to
      bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads
      through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed
      sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the 
      globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue
      and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. 
      The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and 
      prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific
      antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed 
      drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest
      research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics
      of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to
      combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in
      December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health
      agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. METHODS:
      Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2
      test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after
      the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring
      for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough,
      or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for
      SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel
      contacts were also tested. FINDINGS: Patient 1-a woman in her 60s-returned from
      China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia
      and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but
      had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347
      underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195
      health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under
      investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and
      all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
      INTERPRETATION: Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two 
      people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic.
      Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some
      asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected. FUNDING: None.

AB  - World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The
      virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by
      the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with
      SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from
      asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, 
      which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides 
      an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just
      crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 
      largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery,
      zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
      in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with
      SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human 
      coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency
      viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a
      proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses,
      their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes.
      Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host
      antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are 
      also discussed.

AB  - Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as
      SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However,
      there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug
      repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing
      drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug
      discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing
      methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, 
      quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in
      the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV
      whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide
      sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and
      nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved
      regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared 
      to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host
      interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV
      repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are
      further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced
      transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential
      drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus
      melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the "Complementary Exposure"
      pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target
      separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study
      offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate
      repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting
      2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Following the public-health emergency of international concern
      (PHEIC) declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and
      the recent outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [officially
      renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] in China
      and 29 other countries, we aimed to summarise the clinical aspects of the
      novelBetacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its possible clinical presentations
      together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require
      antimicrobial treatment. METHODS: The currently available literature was reviewed
      for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time
      of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed
      database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included 'novel coronavirus' or
      '2019-nCoV' or 'COVID-19'. RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age
      range, 8-92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were 
      commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were
      surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series
      available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral
      lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass
      opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at
      least in the early phases of the disease. CONCLUSION: The new 2019-nCoV epidemic 
      is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs.
      However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory
      co-morbidities.

AB  - Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite
      drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is 
      the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by
      pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities
      have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the
      search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In
      the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a
      public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of
      chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was
      previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including
      SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of
      COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we
      discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2
      replication cycle.

AB  - As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) have been reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China.
      At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal
      coronavirus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible
      is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Three general methods,
      which include existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs using standard assays,
      screening of a chemical library containing many existing compounds or databases, 
      and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical
      understanding of individual coronaviruses, are used to discover the potential
      antiviral treatment of human pathogen coronavirus. Lopinavir /Ritonavir,
      Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1),
      abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs
      (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such
      ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment
      options for 2019-nCoV. However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- 
      nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments.

AB  - Human coronaviruses continue to pose a threat to human health. The emergence of
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019
      which causes coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory disease
      marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human
      population in the twenty-first century. This recent emergence of a previously
      unknown coronavirus in China leads to huge impacts on humans globally. Covid-19
      is a challenge to global public health. Here, we discuss the COVID-19 outbreak in
      a one health context, highlighting the need for the implementation of one health 
      measures and practices to improve human health and reduce the emergence of
      pandemic viruses.

AB  - In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei
      Province; and then named "2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)" by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced
      respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it
      attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the
      request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV
      infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be
      developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice
      guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also
      added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
      This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological
      characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis,
      treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial
      infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover,
      we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe
      2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for
      2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first
      frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections,
      community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person 
      who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.

AB  - In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, identified a cluster of
      pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology linked to the city's South China Seafood
      Market. Subsequent investigations revealed a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as
      the causative agent now at the heart of a major outbreak. The rising case numbers
      have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action, including the
      wholesale isolation of Wuhan. Alongside this has been a robust scientific
      response, including early publication of the pathogen genome, and rapid
      development of highly specific diagnostics. This article will review the new
      knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 acute respiratory disease, and summarise its
      clinical features.

TI  - The Effects of Social Support on Sleep Quality of Medical Staff Treating Patients
      with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January and February 2020 in China.

AB  - BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China.
      Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine
      the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study 
      aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and 
      function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and
      February 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS A one-month cross-sectional
      observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19
      infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social
      support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the
      General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR)
      questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support 
      Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis and SEM
      identified the interactions between these factors. RESULTS Levels of social
      support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and
      sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress.
      Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which 
      negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality. Anxiety, stress, and
      self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep
      quality. CONCLUSIONS SEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating
      patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of
      anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy that were dependent on sleep quality and
      social support.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of
      an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, now named COVID-19. Most cases and
      sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been
      reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy. Since the symptoms are
      similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers
      arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common 
      infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.

TI  - Development of a Laboratory-safe and Low-cost Detection Protocol for SARS-CoV-2
      of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
LID - 10.5607/en20009 [doi]
AB  - The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in
      December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly to over a dozen countries.
      Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries.
      This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via
      respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through
      surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically,
      there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even
      before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost,
      easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed.
      Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based
      assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via
      pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This
      protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we
      tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less 
      than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to 
      be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for
      early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories
      that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly developed protocol should be
      helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further
      prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly
      propagating virus.

TI  - Analyzing the epidemiological outbreak of COVID-19: A visual exploratory data
      analysis approach.

AB  - There is an obvious concern globally regarding the fact about the emerging
      coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a worldwide public health
      threat. As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly
      available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational
      awareness and intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China,
      caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the
      epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting 
      people all around the globe. In this study, we present an effort to compile and
      analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID-19 based on the several
      open datasets on 2019-nCoV provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health
      Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health 
      Commission, and DXY. An exploratory data analysis with visualizations has been
      made to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, and 
      recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China. Overall, at the 
      outset of an outbreak like this, it is highly important to readily provide
      information to begin the evaluation necessary to understand the risks and begin
      containment activities.

TI  - Imaging and clinical features of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-020-04735-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also 
      called 2019-nCoV) recently break out in Wuhan, China, and was named as COVID-19. 
      With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other
      regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of 
      these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: All
      patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4,
      2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). This
      analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age
      range, 18-86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent
      non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical
      characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics,
      pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In
      addition, after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were
      evaluated to assess radiological evolution. FINDINGS: The majority of infected
      patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly
      presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented
      bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%)
      patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19
      pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 
      (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%),
      adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55
      (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon 
      findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21
      patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the 
      second CT after 3-4 days. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based
      on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and
      laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial
      diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass
      opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical
      chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of
      Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
LID - ciaa237 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine
      has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine
      shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety
      profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.
      We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be
      useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill
      SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use 
      of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological
      activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2
      infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were
      implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using
      the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated
      under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst
      considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72
      muM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 muM) in vitro. Based
      on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg
      given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it
      reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice 
      daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more
      potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak
      of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China,
      which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention
      around the world. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral
      drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the
      novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate
      their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential 
      drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and
      therapeutic countermeasures. Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features,
      including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention
      and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV). METHODS: Based on the
      susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption 
      that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are
      resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic
      reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and
      suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by
      other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned
      from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: The basic
      reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on
      the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall
      between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from
      international colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: The early transmission ability of
      2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease 
      with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are
      needed to prevent the further transmissions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To describe the infection control preparedness for Coronavirus
      Disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 [previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus]
      in the first 42 days after announcement of a cluster of pneumonia in China, on 31
      December 2019 (day 1) in Hong Kong. METHODS: A bundle approach of active and
      enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid
      molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers (HCWs)
      with unprotected exposure in the hospitals was implemented. Epidemiological
      characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental and air samples were collected 
      and analyzed. RESULTS: From day 1 to day 42, forty-two (3.3%) of 1275 patients
      fulfilling active (n=29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n=13) confirmed to
      have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The number of locally acquired case significantly
      increased from 1 (7.7%) of 13 [day 22 to day 32] to 27 (93.1%) of 29 confirmed
      case [day 33 to day 42] (p<0.001). Twenty-eight patients (66.6%) came from 8
      family clusters. Eleven (2.7%) of 413 HCWs caring these confirmed cases were
      found to have unprotected exposure requiring quarantine for 14 days. None of them
      was infected and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed.
      Environmental surveillance performed in a patient with viral load of 3.3x106
      copies/ml (pooled nasopharyngeal/ throat swab) and 5.9x106 copies/ml (saliva)
      respectively. SARS-CoV-2 revealed in 1 (7.7%) of 13 environmental samples, but
      not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from patient's chin with or
      without wearing a surgical mask. CONCLUSION: Appropriate hospital infection
      control measures could prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical
      pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The 
      first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019.
      Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to
      bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500
      laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV,
      infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been
      confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including
      Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United
      States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has
      also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one
      provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of
      infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is 
      now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been
      infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions
      that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission?
      What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the
      vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection
      against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the
      generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in
      gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic
      development. Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at

AB  - The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan,
      Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to
      China's public health and clinical treatment. The virus belongs to the beta genus
      Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and 
      MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through 
      droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period
      could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current
      observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger
      transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related 
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor 
      SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot
      of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents,
      identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may
      inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of
      2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic
      coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and 
      control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to
      emerge and represent a serious issue to public health. In the last twenty years, 
      several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most 
      recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first
      identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day,
      an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in
      Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first
      reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019. Published
      literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the
      beginning of December 2019. As they were unable to identify the causative agent, 
      these first cases were classified as "pneumonia of unknown etiology." The Chinese
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an
      intensive outbreak investigation program. The etiology of this illness is now
      attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family. On
      February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,
      announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a "COVID-19," which is the 
      acronym of "coronavirus disease 2019". In the past twenty years, two additional
      coronavirus epidemics have occurred. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic
      beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000
      cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has
      approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases. This
      new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally. In a
      meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR,
      2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four
      countries reporting human-to-human transmission. An additional landmark occurred 
      on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, 
      was recorded in the United States. Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV.
      Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of
      Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one
      that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs). The CoVs have become the major
      pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. They are a large family of
      single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal
      species.[1] For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species
      barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more
      severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. Interestingly, these latter viruses have
      probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts - the
      Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV - before 
      jumping to humans. The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is
      speculation that it also has an animal origin. The potential for these viruses to
      grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk.
      Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the "very
      high" level, on February 28, 2020. Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused
      by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving. On March
      11, as the number of COVID-19 cases outside China has increased 13 times and the 
      number of countries involved has tripled with more than 118,000 cases in 114
      countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. World
      governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating
      effects. Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives 
      and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat. At the same time,
      scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the
      transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and
      prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing. Many uncertainties 
      remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the
      epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its
      peak. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are
      only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community
      is our best weapon. Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to a
      progressive reduction of cases in the last few days. In Italy, in geographic
      regions of the north, initially, and subsequently throughout the peninsula,
      political and health authorities are making incredible efforts to contain a shock
      wave that is severely testing the health system. In the midst of the crisis, the 
      authors have chosen to use the "Statpearls" platform because, within the PubMed
      scenario, it represents a unique tool that may allow them to make updates in
      real-time. The aim, therefore, is to collect information and scientific evidence 
      and to provide an overview of the topic that will be continuously updated.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general
      population. However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate
      the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. METHODS: Clinical
      records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for
      55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab 
      samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital
      of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020. RESULTS: All 55 
      patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%)
      patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
      Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including
      fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive
      lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56x10(9) cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia
      (from 4.5 to 18.28x10(9) cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented
      normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated
      patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus.
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was
      currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific 
      clinical characteristics to distinguish them.

AB  - Rapidly sharing scientific information is an effective way to reduce public panic
      about COVID-19, and doing so is the key to providing real-time guidance to
      epidemiologists working to contain the outbreak, clinicians managing patients,
      and modelers helping to understand future developments and the possible
      effectiveness of various interventions. This issue has rapidly reviewed and
      published articles describing COVID-19, including the drug treatment options for 
      SARS-CoV-2, its clinical characteristics, and therapies involving a combination
      of Chinese and Western medicine, the efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the
      treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia according to clinical studies, and
      reflections on the system of reserve medical supplies for public health
      emergencies. As an academic journal, we will continue to quickly and
      transparently share data with frontline healthcare workers who need to know the
      epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and
      reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health
      concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and 
      clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      data on the global outbreak of "2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV" were obtained 
      from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
      (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the
      information from research documents published in global scientific journals
      indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological 
      and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS:
      Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916
      (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27
      states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April
      2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly
      the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 
      (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The
      fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) 
      and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison
      to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has
      diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious
      than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period
      compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was
      higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in
      coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills,
      cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea,
      confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take
      immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging
      pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.

LID - 10.3390/v12020244 [doi]
AB  - After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world
      in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause
      severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV
      isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the
      Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes
      acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as "coronavirus
      disease 2019" (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused
      widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are 
      some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features
      between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal
      of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and
      SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and 
      treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.

AB  - The 2019-nCoV infection that is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus was first
      detected in China in the end of December 2019 and declared a public health
      emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on January
      30, 2020. Community pharmacists in one of the first areas that had confirmed
      cases of the viral infection, Macau, joined the collaborative force in supporting
      the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements. This paper
      aimed to improve the understanding of community pharmacists' role in case of
      2019-CoV outbreak based on the practical experiences in consultation with the
      recommendations made by the International Pharmaceutical Federation on the
      Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak.

TI  - Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from (Wuhan) Coronavirus 2019-nCoV
      Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus
      Infections.
LID - E194 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v12020194 [doi]
AB  - In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was
      identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of
      China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a
      newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV. The infection moved rapidly
      through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries
      through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple
      countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing
      the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from
      human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is
      estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in
      special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus 
      infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have 
      become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the
      potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity 
      and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published
      data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other
      coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are
      also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials,
      and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.

      2020. We detail the first European cases. As at 21 February, nine European
      countries reported 47 cases. Among 38 cases studied, 21 were linked to two
      clusters in Germany and France, 14 were infected in China. Median case age was 42
      years; 25 were male. Late detection of the clusters' index cases delayed
      isolation of further local cases. As at 5 March, there were 4,250 cases.

AB  - With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and 
      medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to
      optimize patient outcomes. Although little is known about the virus, an
      examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied 
      cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key
      nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed
      therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and
      macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA
      polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95
      %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an
      ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease
      inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We 
      also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in
      the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.

TI  - Natural small molecules as inhibitors of coronavirus lipid-dependent attachment
      to host cells: a possible strategy for reducing SARS-COV-2 infectivity?
PG  - 161-164
LID - 10.23750/abm.v91i1.9402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral infectivity depends on interactions between components of the
      host cell plasma membrane and the virus envelope. Here we review strategies that 
      could help stem the advance of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
      focus on the role of lipid structures, such as lipid rafts and cholesterol,
      involved in the process, mediated by endocytosis, by which viruses attach to and 
      infect cells. Previous studies have shown that many naturally derived substances,
      such as cyclodextrin and sterols, could reduce the infectivity of many types of
      viruses, including the coronavirus family, through interference with
      lipid-dependent attachment to human host cells. CONCLUSIONS: Certain molecules
      prove able to reduce the infectivity of some coronaviruses, possibly by
      inhibiting viral lipid-dependent attachment to host cells. More research into
      these molecules and methods would be worthwhile as it could provide insights the 
      mechanism of transmission of SARS-COV-2 and, into how they could become a basis
      for new antiviral strategies.

AB  - The recent outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, China is caused by a novel
      coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which is genetically close to a bat-derived
      coronavirus. 2019-nCoV is categorized as beta genus coronavirus, same as the two 
      other strains-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle
      East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Antiviral drugs commonly used
      in clinical practice, including neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, paramivir,
      zanamivir, etc.), ganciclovir, acyclovir and ribavirin, are invalid for 2019-nCoV
      and not recommended. Drugs are possibly effective for 2019-nCoV include:
      remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with
      interferon-beta, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies. But the efficacy
      and safety of these drugs for 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients need to be assessed by
      further clinical trials.

AB  - As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed
      outside China. We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe from affected
      areas in China via air travel. We consider travel restrictions in place, three
      reported cases in France, one in Germany. Estimated risk in Europe remains high. 
      The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk. Importation from
      Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe.

AB  - With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new
      coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
      aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections
      with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health
      Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections-SARS in 2002-2003 and
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-both caused severe respiratory
      syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a
      global spread are caused by beta-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually
      infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is
      common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of
      coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and 
      more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations
      of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In
      this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of 
      SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10,
      2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.

AB  - In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported
      in Wuhan, China. A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious
      pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus. This causative virus has been
      temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic
      is spreading in China and all over the world now. The purpose of this review is
      primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of 
      COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on 
      the current evidences. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

AB  - Objective: To understand the viral genomic characteristics of a 2019-nCoV strain 
      in the first COVID-19 patient found in Hangzhou, China. Methods: Viral RNA was
      extracted in throat swab and sputum sample of the patient and was performed
      real-time reverse transcription PCR detection and obtained viral genome by
      high-throughput sequencing method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 29
      2019-nCoV genomes and 30 beta-coronavirus genomes deposited in NCBI GenBank.
      Fifteen genomes from Wuhan were grouped by mutation sites and others were
      identified by Wuhan's or specific mutation sites. Results: A 29 833 bp length
      genome of the first 2019-nCoV strain in Hangzhou was obtained, covering full
      length of the coding regions of coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
      the genome was closest to the genome of a bat SARS-like coronavirus strain RaTG13
      with an identity of 96.11% (28 666/29 826). Among the genes between two genomes, 
      E genes were highly conserved (99.56%), while S genes had lowest identity
      (92.87%), suggesting that S gene was of a faster evolutionary rate. The genome
      sequence similarities among 29 strains from China (Hangzhou, Wuhan, and
      Shenzhen), Japan, USA, and Finland, were all more than 99.9%; however, some
      single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in some strains. Conclusion: The 
      genome of Hangzhou 2019-nCoV strain was very close to the genomes of strains from
      other cities in China and overseas collected at early epidemic phase. The
      2019-nCoV genome sequencing method used in this paper provides an useful tool for
      monitoring variation of viral genes.

TI  - Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.
LID - 10.1002/ddr.21656 [doi]
AB  - At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 
      epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS 
      coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid
      spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing
      vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines
      based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus
      epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus
      strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion
      based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new
      coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R)
      blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and
      mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations
      that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding
      site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic,
      similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This
      commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative
      treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on
      datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.

AB  - A novel zoonotic coronavirus outbreak is spreading all over the world. This
      pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of
      this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential
      RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as
      identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling,
      transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate
      material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual
      errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing
      patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also
      contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the
      diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated
      assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other
      specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for
      minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of
      diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed
      tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to
      epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of
      upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test
      results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear
      instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage,
      together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with
      analytical procedures, including quality assurance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT
      manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective
      study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were
      evaluated. RESULTS. One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range,
      21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever
      in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The 
      laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or
      reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level
      was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one
      lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes
      in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the
      common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had
      ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of 
      lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 
      patients [52%]). Vascular thickening (86 patients [80%]), crazy paving pattern
      (43 patients [40%]), air bronchogram sign (52 patients [48%]), and halo sign (69 
      [64%]) were also observed in this study. CONCLUSION. The early clinical and
      laboratory findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough,
      and fatigue with normal WBC count, reduced lymphocyte count, and elevated
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. The early CT findings are patchy GGO
      with or without consolidation involving multiple lobes, mainly in the peripheral 
      zone, accompanied by halo sign, vascular thickening, crazy paving pattern, or air
      bronchogram sign.

TI  - Repurposing of clinically approved drugs for treatment of coronavirus disease
      2019 in a 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related coronavirus model.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000797 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV
      requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those
      without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to
      repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV
      related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether
      GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was
      investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. 
      The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 
      2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were
      screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by
      GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential 
      drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles
      were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and
      plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V
      shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and
      uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three
      drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited
      complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 mumol/L. CEP
      demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration
      for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 mumol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells
      treated with 10 mumol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP
      treatment ([6.48 +/- 0.02] x 10vs. 1.00 +/- 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h 
      post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media
      containing 10 mumol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent
      antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 +/- 0.37 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.12, t
      = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 +/- 0.43 vs. [6.18 +/- 0.95] x 10, 
      t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable
      model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are
      potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest
      that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial 
      of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown
      etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee 
      on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a
      mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. METHODS: In
      this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model
      for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be 
      bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to 
      explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan
      Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as
      Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix
      approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) from the RP 
      model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The value of R0 
      was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person
      which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from
      introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population
      was 3.58. CONCLUSIONS: Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2
      was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East
      countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in
      the Republic of Korea.

AB  - In December 2019, a new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, has emerged from China
      causing pneumonia outbreaks first in the Wuhan region and have now spread
      worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency. Due to the lack
      of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug
      repurposing appears to be the best tool to find therapeutic solution.
      Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin or ritonavir have shown efficacy to
      inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat
      staphylococci infection, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of
      MERS-coronarivus viral cycle in human cells. This activity is conserved on the
      SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with
      this virus.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of
      COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical
      records.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general
      population. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19
      pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 
      in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19
      infection. METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were
      retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed
      COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted
      to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31,
      2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for 
      the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat
      swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients
      after the first lactation. FINDINGS: All nine patients had a caesarean section in
      their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms,
      including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in
      two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in
      two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1.0 x 10(9) cells per L).
      Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the
      patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine
      livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.
      All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of
      9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples
      from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for
      the virus. INTERPRETATION: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in 
      pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who
      developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest
      that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical
      transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy. FUNDING:

AB  - PURPOSE: To report CT features of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in patients
      with various disease severity. METHODS: The CT manifestations and clinical data
      of 73 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected in 6 hospitals from
      Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020. We analyzed the initial and follow-up CT features of
      patients with disease severity, according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and
      Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia. RESULTS: Six patients (8%) were diagnosed
      as mild type pneumonia; these patients had no obvious abnormal CT findings or
      manifested mild changes of lung infection. All 43 patients (59 %) with common
      type presented unique or multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the periphery
      of the lungs, with or without interlobular septal thickening. In the 21 patients 
      (29 %) with severe type, extensive GGO and pulmonary consolidation were found in 
      16 cases (16/21, 76 %) and 5 cases (24 %), respectively. An extensive "white
      lung", with atelectasis and pleural effusion were found in critical type patients
      (3, 4%). On the resolutive phase of the disease, CT abnormalities showed complete
      resolution, or demonstrated residual linear opacities. CONCLUSIONS: Different CT 
      features are seen according to disease severity, which can help COVID-19
      stratification.

TI  - Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for
      surveillance and response measures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a
      tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in
      Singapore in February, 2020. METHODS: We gathered epidemiological and clinical
      data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient
      medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and
      possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported
      the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: As of Feb 15, 2020,
      36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of
      circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were
      quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected
      individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food)
      could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR
      3-6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 
      days. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and
      local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from
      China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions.
      Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of
      widespread transmission in the community. FUNDING: None.

AB  - The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) makes the medical treatment 
      of colorectal cancers difficult. Cancer patients are more susceptible to
      infection and tumor history is defined as an important factor of poor prognosis, 
      which challenges both doctors and patients. For metastatic colorectal cancer
      (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice. The patients with
      tumor progression or poor biological behavior should receive or continue
      combination chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of
      treatment and shorten the therapy time. Fever patients during chemotherapy need
      to receive differential diagnosis and screening according to national standards. 
      Patients with stable diseases and good general conditions may delay imaging
      examination. Clinicians should make individual clinical decisions based on the
      specifics of each patient during epidemic situation.

AB  - Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently raging in China. It has been
      proven that COVID-19 can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital
      infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients. Although
      colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic,
      but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest
      quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of 
      maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical
      staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the
      clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and
      control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and
      treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences
      of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal 
      cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the
      perioperative management. More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative 
      management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected 
      or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control
      measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main
      points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the
      diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only
      routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department.
      (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of COVID-19 to patients and
      doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and
      life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign
      bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected
      or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and
      intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The
      colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed 
      in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with
      negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, 
      body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified
      disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical
      workers who process colorectal cancer patients with COVID-19 must be protected by
      three-level. After operation, the medical workers must receive medical
      observation and be isolated for 14 days. We hope our "Renji experience" will be
      beneficial to colleagues.

AB  - Pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV infection has been reported in Wuhan since December
      2019, and spread rapidly across the country. The radical operation of colorectal 
      cancer is semi-elective operation. Patients with colorectal cancer should receive
      operation as soon as possible after elective operation is resumed in each
      hospital. 2019-nCoV virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic infectors, and it
      has been confirmed to be transmitted by droplets and contact. However, fecal-oral
      transmission and aerosol transmission have not been excluded. Based on our
      experience with laparoscopic colorectal operation, we propose some surgery
      strategies for colorectal cancer patients under the corona virus disease
      2019(COVID-19) situation: the screening process should be strictly carried out
      before surgery to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection in the later stage;
      laparoscopic-assisted surgery is recommended for radical surgery for patients
      with colorectal cancer; strict aerosol management must be made during the
      operation; natural orifice specimen extraction surgery and transanal total
      mesorectal excision are should be performed prudently; scientific and reasonable 
      prophylactic stoma should be done; personnel protection in surgical ward and
      operation room must be strengthened.

AB  - In December 2019, a new outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 began to occur. Its
      pathogen is 2019-nCoV, which has the characteristics of strong infectivity and
      general susceptibility. The current situation of prevention and control of new
      coronavirus pneumonia is severe. In this context, as front-line medical workers
      bearing important responsibilities and pressure, while through strict management 
      strategy, we can minimize the risk of infection exposure. By summarizing the
      research progress and guidelines in recent years in the fields of colorectal
      cancer disease screening, treatment strategies (including early colorectal
      cancer, locally advanced colorectal cancer, obstructive colorectal cancer,
      metastatic colorectal cancer and the treatment of patients after neoadjuvant
      therapy), the choice of medication and time limit for adjuvant therapy, the
      protective measures for patients undergoing emergency surgery, the re-examination
      of postoperative patients and the protection of medical staff, etc., authors
      improve treatment strategies in order to provide more choices for patients to
      obtain the best treatment under the severe epidemic situation of new coronavirus 
      pneumonia. Meanwhile we hope that it can also provide more timely treatment
      modeling schemes for colleagues.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (now called SARS-CoV-2) initially discovered in Wuhan,
      China, has now become a global pandemic. We describe a patient presenting to an
      Emergency Department in Rhode Island on March 12, 2020 with cough and shortness
      of breath after a trip to Jamaica. The patient underwent nasopharyngeal swab for 
      a respiratory pathogen panel as well as SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. When the respiratory
      pathogen panel was positive for human metapneumovirus, the patient was treated
      and discharged. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR came back positive 24 hours later. Although
      respiratory viral co-infection is thought to be relatively uncommon in adults,
      this case reflects that SARS-CoV-2 testing algorithms that exclude patients who
      test positive for routine viral pathogens may miss SARS-CoV-2 co-infected
      patients.

AB  - Over the past three months, the world has faced an unprecedented health hazard.
      The World Health Organization has announced a pandemic infection with an unknown 
      species of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Spreading mainly through the droplet
      route, the virus causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases, the most common
      being: fever (80%), dry cough (56%), fatigue (22%) and muscle pain (7%); less
      common symptoms include a sore throat, a runny nose, diarrhea, hemoptysis and
      chills. A life-threatening complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs more often in older adults,
      those with immune disorders and co-morbidities. Severe forms of the infection,
      being an indication for treatment in the intensive care unit, comprise acute lung
      inflammation, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. The article presents basic
      information about etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics (with particular
      emphasis on the importance of tomocomputer imaging), clinical picture, treatment 
      and prevention of the infection. It goes on to emphasize the specific risks of
      providing anesthesiology and intensive care services. Due to the fact that
      effective causal treatment is not yet available and the number of infections and 
      deaths increases day by day, infection prevention and strict adherence to
      recommendations of infection control organizations remain the basis for fighting 
      the virus.

AB  - Switzerland is among the countries with the highest number of coronavirus
      disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases per capita in the world. There are likely many
      people with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection because testing efforts are currently
      not detecting all infected people, including some with clinical disease
      compatible with COVID-19. Testing on its own will not stop the spread of
      SARS-CoV-2. Testing is part of a strategy. The World Health Organization
      recommends a combination of measures: rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of 
      cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts. In
      this article, we explain why the testing strategy in Switzerland should be
      strengthened urgently, as a core component of a combination approach to control
      COVID-19.

TI  - Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Surveillance and Containment Measures for the

PG  - 307-311
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm6911e1 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in
      December 2019, and has since spread globally, resulting in >95,000 confirmed
      COVID-19 cases worldwide by March 5, 2020 (1). Singapore adopted a multipronged
      surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical
      consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19,
      enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with
      pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible
      infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and
      deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion
      (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case
      definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients. Containment measures,
      including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border
      controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize
      disease spread. As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been
      identified in Singapore. This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in 
      Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment
      measures. COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they
      were detected. Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 
      73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by
      laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion. Effectiveness of
      these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the
      interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which
      indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19
      cases. Rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts,
      and active monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing
      expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing 
      outbreaks.

TI  - Natural small molecules as inhibitors of coronavirus lipid-dependent attachment
      to host cells: a possible strategy for reducing SARS-COV-2 infectivity?
PG  - 161-164
LID - 10.23750/abm.v91i1.9402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral infectivity depends on interactions between components of the
      host cell plasma membrane and the virus envelope. Here we review strategies that 
      could help stem the advance of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
      focus on the role of lipid structures, such as lipid rafts and cholesterol,
      involved in the process, mediated by endocytosis, by which viruses attach to and 
      infect cells. Previous studies have shown that many naturally derived substances,
      such as cyclodextrin and sterols, could reduce the infectivity of many types of
      viruses, including the coronavirus family, through interference with
      lipid-dependent attachment to human host cells. CONCLUSIONS: Certain molecules
      prove able to reduce the infectivity of some coronaviruses, possibly by
      inhibiting viral lipid-dependent attachment to host cells. More research into
      these molecules and methods would be worthwhile as it could provide insights the 
      mechanism of transmission of SARS-COV-2 and, into how they could become a basis
      for new antiviral strategies.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Distinguishes COVID-19 from Community Acquired Pneumonia 
      on Chest CT.
PG  - 200905
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2020200905 [doi]
AB  - Background Coronavirus disease has widely spread all over the world since the
      beginning of 2020. It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of
      COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect
      COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performances. Materials and Methods In
      this retrospective and multi-center study, a deep learning model, COVID-19
      detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from 
      volumetric chest CT exams for the detection of COVID-19. Community acquired
      pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia CT exams were included to test the
      robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from 6 hospitals between
      August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and
      specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4356 chest CT exams from 
      3,322 patients. The average age is 49+/-15 years and there were slightly more
      male patients than female (1838 vs 1484; p-value=0.29). The per-exam sensitivity 
      and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 114 of 127
      (90% [95% CI: 83%, 94%]) and 294 of 307 (96% [95% CI: 93%, 98%]), respectively,
      with an AUC of 0.96 (p-value<0.001). The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for
      detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175) and 92% (239 of
      259), respectively, with an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusions A deep 
      learning model can accurately detect COVID-19 and differentiate it from community
      acquired pneumonia and other lung diseases.

AB  - At present, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rampaging around the world.
      However, asymptomatic carriers intensified the difficulty of prevention and
      management. Here we reported the screening, clinical feathers, and treatment
      process of a family cluster involving three COVID-19 patients. The discovery of
      the first asymptomatic carrier in this family cluster depends on the repeated and
      comprehensive epidemiological investigation by disease control experts. In
      addition, the combination of multiple detection methods can help clinicians find 
      asymptomatic carriers as early as possible. In conclusion, the prevention and
      control experience of this family cluster showed that comprehensive rigorous
      epidemiological investigation and combination of multiple detection methods were 
      of great value for the detection of hidden asymptomatic carriers. This article is

TI  - CT image of novel coronavirus pneumonia: a case report.
LID - 10.1007/s11604-020-00945-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of CT characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia might be helpful
      to the early diagnosis and treatment of patients, and to control the spread of
      infection. METHODS: The chest CT images of the patient were collected to describe
      the CT manifestations and characteristics, and they were compared with the
      previous studies. RESULTS: Multiple patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were
      seen in bilateral lung, mostly in subpleural areas. They progressed within 3
      days, and nodular GGOs were also seen together with subpleural patchy GGOs.
      CONCLUSION: Our case of COVID-19 pneumonia showed multiple subpleural GGOs in
      bilateral lung, rapid progression, and it also accompanied nodular GGOs on chest 
      CT. These findings were consistent with the previous reports, and they might be
      useful for early detection and evaluation of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan,
      Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to
      China's public health and clinical treatment. The virus belongs to the beta genus
      Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and 
      MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through 
      droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period
      could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current
      observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger
      transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related 
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor 
      SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot
      of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents,
      identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may
      inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of
      2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic
      coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and 
      control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.

AB  - The 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19) has cost a great loss to the health and
      economic property of Chines people. Under such a special circumstance, how to
      deal with such patients with acute aortic syndrome has become a serious
      challenge. Rapid diagnosis of concomitant COVID-19, safe and effective
      transportation, implementation of the interventional procedure, protection of
      vascular surgical team and postoperative management and follow-up of such
      patients have become urgent problems for us. Combined with the latest novel
      government documents, the literature and the experiences from Wuhan, we answered 
      the above questions briefly and plainly. We also hope to inspire the national
      vascular surgeons to manage critical emergencies in vascular surgery and even
      routine vascular diseases with COVID-19, as a final point to limit the severe
      epidemic situation, and minimize the damage of COVID-19.

AB  - The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that
      emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries
      worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus
      (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no 
      licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the
      efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S 
      protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates 
      have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized
      animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection.
      This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics
      to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made 
      with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt
      this emerging virus infection.

      Pneumonia: A Preliminary Analysis.
PG  - 1-6

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations 
      and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women 
      and to provide some initial evidence that can be used for guiding treatment of
      pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the
      clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 
      pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020. A
      semiquantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate pulmonary involvement and
      the time course of changes on chest CT. Symptoms and laboratory results were
      analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were
      tracked. RESULTS. Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries
      and one vaginal delivery) during the study period, and four patients were still
      pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the
      end of the study period. No cases of neonatal asphyxia, neonatal death,
      stillbirth, or abortion were reported. The most common early finding on chest CT 
      was ground-glass opacity (GGO). With disease progression, crazy paving pattern
      and consolidations were seen on CT. The abnormalities showed absorptive changes
      at the end of the study period for all patients. The most common onset symptoms
      of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were fever (13/15 patients) and cough
      (9/15 patients). The most common abnormal laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia 
      (12/15 patients). CT images obtained before and after delivery showed no signs of
      pneumonia aggravation after delivery. The four patients who were still pregnant
      at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had
      achieved good recovery. CONCLUSION. Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate
      the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia. All the cases of
      COVID-19 pneumonia in the pregnant women in our study were the mild type. All the
      women in this study-some of whom did not receive antiviral drugs-achieved good
      recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - Severe and critical coronavirus pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19) often occurs in elder
      patients with multiple comorbidities, and severe hypoxemia events are an
      important factor in the deterioration of some cases. The critical type of
      COVID-19 could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ
      dysfunction, which are the most important causes of death. Early start with
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) against the possible physiological abnormalities
      could be helpful to improve prognosis. Close monitoring of oxygenation, reducing 
      patients' oxygen consumption, active psychological intervention, and rapidly
      dealing with severe hypoxemia events are the key factors for the successful
      treatment of NIV. In addition, active adjuvant therapy is also important, such as
      correcting coagulation dysfunction, providing proper nutritional support,
      accurate volume control, and safe individualized blood glucose monitoring and
      control.

AB  - Objective: Analyzing the symptom characteristics of Coronavirus Disease
      2019(COVID-19) to improve its prevention. Methods: Using Baidu Index Platform
      (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control
      and Prevention as data resources to obtain the search volume (SV) of keywords for
      symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from
      2017 to 2020, in Hubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in China and 
      the epidemic data. Data of 2020 were compared with the previous three years. Data
      of Hubei province were compared with confirmed cases. The differences and
      characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation
      between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and
      the hysteresis effects were discussed. Results: Compared the data from January 1 
      to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years,
      Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other
      symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms
      was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001). The
      SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with new confirmed 
      or suspected cases (R(confirmed) = 0.723, R(suspected) = 0.863, all P < 0.001).
      The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who
      retrieved relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days
      later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. Conclusions: The total SV of lower
      respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the
      SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. It warns us to pay attention to not 
      only the symptoms of lower respiratory tract, but also the gastrointestinal
      symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19. There is a relationship 
      between Internet retrieval behavior and the number of new confirmed or suspected 
      cases. Big data has a certain role in the early warning of infectious diseases.

PG  - 7-9

AB  - Since the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been
      extensively epidemic in China, which not only seriously threatens the safety and 
      health of Chinese people, but also challenges the management of other infectious 
      diseases. Currently, there are still approximately three thousand malaria cases
      imported into China every year. If the diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases
      as well as the investigation and response of the epidemic foci are not carried
      out timely, it may endanger patients'lives and cause the possible of secondary
      transmission, which threatens the achievements of malaria elimination in China.
      Due to the extensive spread and high transmission ability of the COVID-19, there 
      is a possibility of virus infections among malaria cases during the medical
      care-seeking behaviors and among healthcare professionals during clinical
      diagnosis and treatment, sample collection and testing and epidemiological
      surveys. This paper analyzes the challenges of the COVID-19 for Chinese malaria
      elimination programme, and proposes the countermeasures in response to the
      COVID-19 outbreak, so as to provide the reference for healthcare professionals.

AB  - Crises often drive innovation. The COVID 19 pandemic has led to the necessary
      postponement of much planned surgical activity with the cancellation of
      outpatient, diagnostic and operative work. These measures have been designed to
      'flatten the curve' and delay the spread of coronavirus whilst also freeing up
      capacity within hospitals for patients affected with the virus. This inevitable
      postponement of routine activity will create challenges to health care systems
      when normal business resumes and in many healthcare settings, which are often
      already resource constrained. This will impose an additional burden on patients
      whose diagnoses and treatment will be delayed.

TI  - Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and
      control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a
      scoping review.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s40249-020-00646-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause
      of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning
      in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries
      with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization 
      has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A
      scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by 
      Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published
      before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the
      epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus.
      The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors'
      affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis.
      All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based
      on published information as listed in the references. RESULTS: Most of the
      publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest
      proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority
      (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused
      on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to
      prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination
      is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations
      have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue,
      pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such 
      as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection,
      contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce
      transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective;
      hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive
      care. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the
      outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily
      explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well 
      as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are
      relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is
      needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health
      emergency in both the short- and long-term.

LID - E789 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9030789 [doi]
AB  - The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan was reported on 15
      January 2020 and the number of reported cases has increased day by day. The
      purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19
      in Japan by using the real-time data from 15 January to 29 February 2020. Taking 
      into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete identification of infective
      population, we apply the well-known SEIR compartmental model for the prediction. 
      By using a least-square-based method with Poisson noise, we estimate that the
      basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Japan is R 0 = 2 . 6 ( 95 % CI, 2 .
      4 - 2 . 8 ) and the epidemic peak could possibly reach the early-middle summer.
      In addition, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential 
      epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the 
      actual infective population; (2) the intervention has a positive effect on the
      delay of the epidemic peak; (3) intervention over a relatively long period is
      needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size.

TI  - Reverse Logistics Network Design for Effective Management of Medical Waste in
      Epidemic Outbreaks: Insights from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      Outbreak in Wuhan (China).
LID - E1770 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17051770 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of an epidemic disease may pose significant treats to human beings
      and may further lead to a global crisis. In order to control the spread of an
      epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through
      establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance.
      However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an
      epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic
      outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a
      significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper
      proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse
      logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the
      best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for
      effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very
      short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based
      on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even 
      though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the
      time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be
      obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among
      other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an
      effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during
      the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary
      incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available
      data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to
      assess the effectiveness of the current solution.

TI  - Successful recovery of COVID-19 pneumonia in a renal transplant recipient with
      long-term immunosuppression.

AB  - The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised great
      concern worldwide, but its impact on transplant recipients is unknown. We report 
      here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported renal
      transplant recipient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. This is a 52-year-old man
      who received kidney transplantation 12 years ago. His overall clinical
      characteristics (symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT) were similar to
      those of non-transplanted COVID-19 patients. Following a treatment regimen
      consisting of reduced immunosuppressant use and low dose methylprednisolone-based
      therapy, the COVID-19 pneumonia in this long-term immunosuppressive patient was
      successfully recovered. This effectively treated case has reference value for the
      future treatment of other transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with prognosis in patients with Corona
      Virus Disease-19.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25767 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: SinceDecember 2019, novelcoronavirus infected pneumonia emerged in 
      Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. In severe novel coronavirus
      pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the
      treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR)were a concern. We sought to describe
      platelet feature of these cases. METHODS: Single-center case series of the 30
      hospitalized patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease(COVID)-19 in Huizhou
      municipal central hospitalfrom January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively
      analysed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laborotary results 
      and treatment date were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and
      non-severe patients were compared. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that: age,
      platelet peaks and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe
      patients,multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during 
      treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.The average
      hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were longer 
      than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05).The average age of patients with
      platelet peaks during treatment were older than those without platelet
      peaks(P<0.05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during
      treatment had longer average hospitalization day. And the higher PLR of patients 
      during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. CONCLUSION:
      Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19
      in Huizhou municipal central hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and 
      their dynamic changes during the treatment may have suggestion on the severity
      and prognosis of disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer
      average hospitalization day may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of
      patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator 
      in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by

TI  - A guideline for homology modeling of the proteins from newly discovered
      betacoronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25768 [doi]
AB  - During an outbreak of respiratory diseases including atypical pneumonia in Wuhan,
      a previously unknown beta-coronavirus was detected in patients. The newly
      discovered coronavirus is similar to some beta-coronaviruses found in bats, but
      different from previously known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High sequence identities
      and similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV was found. In this work, we
      searched the homologous templates of all nonstructural and structural proteins of
      2019-nCoV. Among the nonstructural proteins, the leader protein (nsp1), the
      papain-like protease (nsp3), the nsp4, the 3C-like protease (nsp5), the nsp7, the
      nsp8, the nsp9, the nsp10, the RNA-directed RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase 
      (nsp13), the guanine-N7 methyltransferase (nsp14), the uridylate-specific
      endoribonuclease (nsp15), the 2'-O-methyltransferase (nsp16), and the ORF7a
      protein could be built on the basis of homology templates. Among the structural
      proteins, the spike protein (S-protein), the envelope protein (E-protein), and
      the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) can be constructed based on the crystal
      structures of the proteins from SARS-CoV. It is known that PL-Pro, 3CL-Pro, and
      RdRp are important targets for design antiviral drugs against 2019-nCoV. And S
      protein is critical target candidate for inhibitor screening or vaccine design
      against 2019-nCoV because coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of 
      S protein to cell surface receptors. It is believed that these proteins should be
      useful for further structure-based virtual screening and related computer-aided
      drug development and vaccine design. This article is protected by copyright. All

AB  - Preparing for public health emergencies is an ongoing process and involves a
      variety of approaches and tools. Tabletop exercises are one of the tools designed
      to simulate the emergence of a public health emergency and address some or all of
      the phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and
      recovery.1 They typically are designed to include participation of stakeholders
      from diverse and complementary backgrounds, including command, operations,
      logistics, planning, and finance.2 Effective tabletop exercises provide a
      plausible scenario that require cooperation and communication from these
      functional areas. Tabletops also require forward thinking and planning in a
      variety of scenarios. When a public health emergency occurs, decision makers may 
      be overwhelmed with decisions that need their immediate attention. Tabletop
      exercises can provide a framework to help decision makers anticipate future
      challenges, which may provide the mental model encompassing knowledge and
      insights that inform both current and future decisions.

      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective
      study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were
      evaluated. RESULTS. One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range,
      21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever
      in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The 
      laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or
      reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level
      was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one
      lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes
      in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the
      common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had
      ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of 
      lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 
      patients [52%]). Vascular thickening (86 patients [80%]), crazy paving pattern
      (43 patients [40%]), air bronchogram sign (52 patients [48%]), and halo sign (69 
      [64%]) were also observed in this study. CONCLUSION. The early clinical and
      laboratory findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough,
      and fatigue with normal WBC count, reduced lymphocyte count, and elevated
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. The early CT findings are patchy GGO
      with or without consolidation involving multiple lobes, mainly in the peripheral 
      zone, accompanied by halo sign, vascular thickening, crazy paving pattern, or air
      bronchogram sign.

TI  - The positive impact of lockdown in Wuhan on containing the COVID-19 outbreak in
      China.
LID - taaa037 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jtm/taaa037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was
      declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World 
      Health Organization (WHO). Consequently, many countries have implemented flight
      restrictions to China. China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of
      Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province. However, whether these two enormous
      measures have led to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains 
      unclear. METHODS: We analyzed available data on the development of confirmed
      domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after lockdown measures. We 
      evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed
      COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China
      before and after lockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic
      criteria. RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time 
      from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9-2.6), to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5-4.3),
      after imposing lockdown. A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic
      and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1-26.3), respectively. Moreover, the 
      correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker
      following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, p < 0.05 vs. after lockdown: r =
      0.91, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased
      doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown
      measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have 
      a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of different anesthetic regimens for parturients with
      COVID-19 undergoing Cesarean delivery: a case series of 17 patients.
LID - 10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the management and safety of epidural or general anesthesia
      for Cesarean delivery in parturients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and
      their newborns, and to evaluate the standardized procedures for protecting
      medical staff. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients
      diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
      infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed
      tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity
      were evaluated. We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical
      characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal
      complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff.
      RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult
      patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia
      performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of
      the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing
      significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general
      anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three
      of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are
      receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born
      prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All
      neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were
      infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and
      general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with
      COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia
      appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and
      effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from
      COVID-19.

TI  - Clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19: a report of two family
      cluster cases.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-020-00356-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the
      globe. People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19. However, literature
      reports on pediatric patients are limited. METHODS: To improve the recognition of
      COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed
      pediatric cases from two family clusters. Both clinical features and laboratory
      examination results of the children and their family members were described.
      RESULTS: The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or
      gastrointestinal symptoms. Both of them had normal chest CT images. After general
      and symptomatic treatments, both children recovered quickly. Both families had
      travel histories to Hubei Province. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with COVID-19
      are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history. Infected
      children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults. We should
      attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of
      infected children.

AB  - Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19) were mainly based on information from adult populations.
      Limited data are available for children with COVID-19, especially for infected
      infants. We report a 55-day-old case with COVID-19 confirmed in China and
      describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the
      patient, including the disease progression from day 7 to day 11 of illness. This 
      case highlights that children with COVID-19 can also present with multiple organ 
      damage and rapid disease changes. When managing such patients, frequent and
      careful clinical monitoring is essential.

AB  - In December 2019, a new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, has emerged from China
      causing pneumonia outbreaks first in the Wuhan region and have now spread
      worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency. Due to the lack
      of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug
      repurposing appears to be the best tool to find therapeutic solution.
      Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin or ritonavir have shown efficacy to
      inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat
      staphylococci infection, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of
      MERS-coronarivus viral cycle in human cells. This activity is conserved on the
      SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with
      this virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel
      coronavirus (COVID 2019, SARS-CoV2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, in China at the end 
      of December 2019. The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French
      nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We 
      decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the
      population and decision-makers. METHODS: We investigated the presence of
      SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within
      the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted
      from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of
      nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using
      several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. RESULTS: We tested 337
      passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By
      optimising the sampling process, sending samples sequentially and reducing the
      time-scale for biological analysis, we were able to test the samples within 5 h
      (including sampling, shipment and biological tests). CONCLUSION: Optimising our
      procedures reduces anxiety and reassures the population and decision makers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in
      December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International
      Concern (PHEIC). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially
      characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19
      have been published to date. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review
      with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging
      features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and
      also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a
      random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95%
      confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: 660 articles were retrieved for the time
      frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for
      full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative 
      analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed
      separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5-92.9%), cough (57.6%,
      95%CI 40.8-74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9-80.4%) were the most prevalent
      manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0-30.6%) required intensive
      care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
      (95%CI 13.7-51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1-9.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2-21.5%) 
      of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR).
      CONCLUSION: COVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in
      patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of
      polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a 
      CFR of >13%. As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare
      human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease
      with lack of established laboratory markers available to evaluate illness
      severity. In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could
      differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease.
      Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19.
      METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed
      to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A
      meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD)
      of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds
      ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies
      with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in
      the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was
      significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31x10(9)/L; 95%
      CI, from -35 to -29x10(9)/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival,
      found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48x10(9)/L;
      95% CI, -57 to -39x10(9)/L. In the four studies (n=1427) which reported data on
      rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold 
      enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). CONCLUSIONS: Low
      platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality 
      in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of
      worsening illness during hospitalization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in
      December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health
      agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. METHODS:
      Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2
      test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after
      the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring
      for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough,
      or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for
      SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel
      contacts were also tested. FINDINGS: Patient 1-a woman in her 60s-returned from
      China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia
      and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but
      had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347
      underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195
      health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under
      investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and
      all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
      INTERPRETATION: Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two 
      people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic.
      Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some
      asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected. FUNDING: None.

AB  - The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global
      public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report
      our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed 
      (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host
      cell adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of 
      spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and
      camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our study
      also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein
      potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for
      hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique features of
      COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread
      rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 100,000 confirmed infections and
      4000 fatalities (as of 10 March 2020). The outbreak has been declared a pandemic 
      by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in
      transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine
      diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic
      coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for
      SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of
      different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show 
      that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate
      regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021.
      Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation
      in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the 
      scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might
      be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but
      do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2
      should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global
      transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection
      control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave
      with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of
      opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: From December 2019 to February 2020, 2019 severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a serious outbreak of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Related clinical features are needed.
      METHODS: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan
      between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020.
      RESULTS: The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0),
      and 32 patients (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]),
      cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy 
      (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).
      As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five
      patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%. According to the lowest SpO2
      during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2>/=90% group (n=55) and the
      SpO2<90% group (n=14). All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2<90% group. Compared with
      SpO2>/=90% group, patients of the SpO2<90% group were older, and showed more
      comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c
      reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging
      rate and decrease the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to show
      frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a 
      mortality rate of 7.5%. Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are
      at higher risk of death.

TI  - Early estimation of the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in mainland China: a
      data-driven analysis.
PG  - 128
LID - 10.21037/atm.2020.02.66 [doi]
AB  - Background: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus
      [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2], named COVID-19, hit
      a major city of China, Wuhan in December 2019 and subsequently spread to other
      provinces/regions of China and overseas. Several studies have been done to
      estimate the basic reproduction number in the early phase of this outbreak, yet
      there are no reliable estimates of case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 to date.
      Methods: In this study, we used a purely data-driven statistical method to
      estimate the CFR in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Daily numbers of
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected from January 10 to 
      February 3, 2020 and divided into three clusters: Wuhan city, other cities of
      Hubei province, and other provinces of mainland China. Simple linear regression
      model was applied to estimate the CFR from each cluster. Results: We estimated
      that CFR during the first weeks of the epidemic ranges from 0.15% (95% CI:
      0.12-0.18%) in mainland China excluding Hubei through 1.41% (95% CI: 1.38-1.45%) 
      in Hubei province excluding the city of Wuhan to 5.25% (95% CI: 4.98-5.51%) in
      Wuhan. Conclusions: Our early estimates suggest that the CFR of COVID-19 is lower
      than the previous coronavirus epidemics caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

TI  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review of Imaging Findings in
      919 Patients.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.23034 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. Available information on CT features of the 2019 novel coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19) is scattered in different publications, and a cohesive
      literature review has yet to be compiled. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This article
      includes a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), Google
      Scholar, and the World Health Organization database. RESULTS. Known features of
      COVID-19 on initial CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification
      (GGO) with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes and 
      less frequently within the right middle lobe. Atypical initial imaging
      presentation of consolidative opacities superimposed on GGO may be found in a
      smaller number of cases, mainly in the elderly population. Septal thickening,
      bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement are some of the
      less common findings, mainly in the later stages of the disease. Pleural
      effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, CT halo sign, and
      pneumothorax are uncommon but may be seen with disease progression. Follow-up CT 
      in the intermediate stage of disease shows an increase in the number and size of 
      GGOs and progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative
      opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy paving pattern, with the
      greatest severity of CT findings visible around day 10 after the symptom onset.
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most common indication for
      transferring patients with COVID-19 to the ICU and the major cause of death in
      this patient population. Imaging patterns corresponding to clinical improvement
      usually occur after week 2 of the disease and include gradual resolution of
      consolidative opacities and decrease in the number of lesions and involved lobes.
      CONCLUSION. This systematic review of current literature on COVID-19 provides
      insight into the initial and follow-up CT characteristics of the disease.

TI  - Clinical Features and Chest CT Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019
      (COVID-19) in a Single-Center Study in Shanghai, China.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.22959 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease
      2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected
      COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to
      assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing
      patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who
      presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19
      through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven
      patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical 
      difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of
      leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (+/- SD) interval between
      onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 +/- 
      2.00 and 5.52 +/- 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test
      results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive 
      results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows:
      ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus
      72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR
      results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of
      patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of
      patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The
      median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with
      positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5
      affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air
      bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive 
      results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with
      positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this
      study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed 
      GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of 
      more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first
      week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.

      global scale. While there is currently no vaccine or effective drugs. Pulmonary
      fibrosis is a pulmonary disease with progressive fibrosis, which is the main
      factor leading to pulmonary dysfunction and quality of life decline in SARS
      survivors after recovery. Extensive epidemiological, viral immunological, and
      current clinical evidences support the possibility that pulmonary fibrosis may be
      one of the major complications in COVID-19 patients. Although there are no
      reports on the mechanism of COVID-19 inducing pulmonary fibrosis, based on the
      existing theoretical basis, we focus on the possible mechanism of COVID-19
      sustained lung damaging, the key role of abnormal immune mechanism in the
      initiation and promotion of pulmonary fibrosis, and the corresponding therapeutic
      measures.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of refractory COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
LID - ciaa270 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected
      pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China. This
      study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19. 
      METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive
      patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from
      January 1st to February 5th. The cases were divided into general and refractory
      COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the
      difference between groups were compared. RESULTS: Compared with general COVID-19 
      patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying
      comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature
      among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer
      disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower
      levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and 
      pleural effusion (P<0.05). Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to
      receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment
      including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P<0.05). After
      adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male
      sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen,
      expectorant and adjunctive agents (P<0.05) when considering the factors of
      disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.
      CONCLUSION: Nearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and
      radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization. The patients with
      male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.

TI  - Patients of COVID-19 may benefit from sustained lopinavir-combined regimen and
      the increase of eosinophil may predict the outcome of COVID-19 progression.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the epidemiological information, clinical characteristics,
      therapeutic outcomes and temporal progression of laboratory findings in
      2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exposed to lopinavir. METHODS: We
      collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and
      February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China. RESULTS: Of ten patients, 
      secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged, the incubation period was 3-7
      days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3-38.0 ). An
      asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others existed ground glass
      opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir
      on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of
      adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who
      with sustained lopinavir using. Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were
      low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on
      initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load
      of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3-14, 6-8 and 
      7-9 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator
      of COVID-19 improvement. The COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained
      lopinavir using. More researches on a larger scale are needed to verify these
      points.

      a systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - S1201-9712(20)30136-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) in Wuhan, China, the
      epidemic is more widespread than initially estimated, with cases now confirmed in
      multiple countries. AIMS: The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the
      prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and the risk of
      underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. METHODS: 
      A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of 
      sciences until February 25, 2020. Risk ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals
      (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: Eight studies were
      included in the meta- analysis, including 46248 infected patients. The result
      showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever ( 91 +/- 3, 95% CI 86-97% ),
      followed by cough (67 +/- 7, 95% CI 59-76%), fatigue ( 51 +/- 0, 95% CI 34-68% ) 
      and dyspnea ( 30 +/- 4, 95% CI 21-40%). The most prevalent comorbidity were
      hypertension (17 +/- 7, 95% CI 14-22%) and diabetes ( 8 +/- 6, 95% CI 6-11% ),
      followed by cardiovascular diseases ( 5 +/- 4, 95% CI 4-7% ) and respiratory
      system disease( 2 +/- 0, 95% CI 1-3% ). Compared with the Non-severe patient, the
      pooled odds ratio of hypertension, respiratory system disease, cardiovascular
      disease in severe patients were (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46-3.83), (OR 2.46, 95% CI:
      1.76-3.44) and (OR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.88-6.22)respectively. CONCLUSION: We assessed 
      the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and found
      underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and
      cardiovascular, may be a risk factor for severe patients compared with Non-severe
      patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: An emerging outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected in at least 26
      countries worldwide. Given this pandemic situation, robust risk communication is 
      urgently needed particularly in affected countries. Therefore, this study
      explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor public restlessness
      toward COVID-19 epidemic infection in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrieved GT data for
      the specific locations of Taiwan nationwide and subregions using defined search
      terms related to coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks. RESULTS: Searches
      related to COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan increased rapidly, following the
      announcements of Taiwan' first imported case and reached its peak as local cases 
      were reported. However, searches for handwashing were gradually increased in
      period of face masks shortage. Moreover, high to moderate correlations between
      Google relative search volume (RSV) and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei
      (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), Tainan (lag-1), Taichung (lag0),
      and Kaohsiung (lag0). CONCLUSION: In response to the ongoing outbreak, our
      results demonstrated that GT could potentially define the proper timing and
      location for practicing appropriate risk communication strategies to the affected
      population.

AB  - Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the
      2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is
      caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than
      75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than
      2000 deaths worldwide. Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities 
      were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public
      health emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an
      asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults
      represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates,
      children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition,
      nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral
      transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on 
      chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with
      bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with
      underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity
      may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is 
      lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents,
      including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China. Currently, effective
      infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of
      SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - PURPOSE: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of
      international concern. As of this time, there is no known effective
      pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the 
      severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize
      the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS:
      PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use
      of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included six articles (one 
      narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two 
      national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China.
      Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2
      (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: There is rationale, pre-clinical 
      evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for 
      other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with
      COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency
      Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a
      trial as stated by the World Health Organization. Safety data and data from
      high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed.

AB  - World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The
      virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by
      the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with
      SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from
      asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, 
      which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides 
      an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just
      crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 
      largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery,
      zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
      in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with
      SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human 
      coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency
      viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a
      proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses,
      their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes.
      Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host
      antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are 
      also discussed.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the pathological characteristics and the clinical
      significance of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (termed by WHO
      as corona virus disease 2019, COVID-19). Methods: Minimally invasive autopsies
      from lung, heart, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, stomach,
      intestine, thyroid and skin were performed on three patients died of novel
      coronavirus pneumonia in Chongqing, China. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE)
      and histochemical staining were performed to investigate the pathological changes
      of indicated organs or tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to
      evaluate the infiltration of immune cells as well as the expression of 2019-nCoV 
      proteins. Real time PCR was carried out to detect the RNA of 2019-nCoV. Results: 
      Various damages were observed in the alveolar structure, with minor serous
      exudation and fibrin exudation. Hyaline membrane formation was observed in some
      alveoli. The infiltrated immune cells in alveoli were majorly macrophages and
      monocytes. Moderate multinucleated giant cells, minimal lymphocytes, eosinophils 
      and neutrophils were also observed. Most of infiltrated lymphocytes were
      CD4-positive T cells. Significant proliferation of type II alveolar epithelia and
      focal desquamation of alveolar epithelia were also indicated. The blood vessels
      of alveolar septum were congested, edematous and widened, with modest
      infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Hyaline thrombi were found in a
      minority of microvessels. Focal hemorrhage in lung tissue, organization of
      exudates in some alveolar cavities, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosiswere
      observed. Part of the bronchial epithelia were exfoliated. Coronavirus particles 
      in bronchial mucosal epithelia and type II alveolar epithelia were observed under
      electron microscope. Immunohistochemical staining showed that part of the
      alveolar epithelia and macrophages were positive for 2019-nCoV antigen. Real time
      PCR analyses identified positive signals for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Decreased
      numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed in spleen.
      Furthermore, degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells, formation of hyaline
      thrombus in small vessels, and pathological changes of chronic diseases were
      observed in other organs and tissues, while no evidence of coronavirus infection 
      was observed in these organs. Conclusion: s The lungs from novel coronavirus
      pneumonia patients manifest significant pathological lesions, including the
      alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation, alveolar
      epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation. While the 2019-nCoV is
      mainly distributed in lung, the infection also involves in the damages of heart, 
      vessels, liver, kidney and other organs. Further studies are warranted to
      investigate the mechanism underlying pathological changes of this disease.

AB  - A novel zoonotic coronavirus outbreak is spreading all over the world. This
      pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of
      this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential
      RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as
      identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling,
      transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate
      material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual
      errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing
      patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also
      contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the
      diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated
      assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other
      specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for
      minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of
      diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed
      tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to
      epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of
      upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test
      results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear
      instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage,
      together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with
      analytical procedures, including quality assurance.

AB  - Background As the number of patients increases, there is a growing understanding 
      of the form of pneumonia sustained by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2),
      which has caused an outbreak in China. Up to now, clinical features and treatment
      of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail. However, the
      relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our 
      aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect
      blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the
      same period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the 
      control group (p < 0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation
      products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially
      higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in
      patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with
      milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) 
      was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients
      was also shorter than that in controls. Conclusions The coagulation function in
      patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, 
      but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification
      of severe cases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since January 23rd 2020, stringent measures for controlling the novel
      coronavirus epidemics have been gradually enforced and strengthened in mainland
      China. The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well. However, the daily
      reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction
      difficult. METHODS: Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the
      effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current
      epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource
      datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and
      suspected cases. RESULTS: Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly
      depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of
      quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection
      points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The
      estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods
      are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are
      increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in suspected class, 
      which has been ignored in existing models. CONCLUSIONS: The uncertainty analyses 
      reveal that the epidemics is still uncertain and it is important to continue
      enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate 
      in mainland China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout
      China. We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for
      patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort
      study, we included adults (age>/=18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
      without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020.
      Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the 
      combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5-21 days. The
      primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of
      COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was
      progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). RESULTS: We analyzed 16 patients who
      received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r
      only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis. Baseline
      clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups.
      The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients' nasopharyngeal
      specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 
      in the monotherapy group (p < 0.05). After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52.9%) 
      of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected (p < 0.05). The chest CT
      scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after
      seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0.05).
      CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, the apparent favorable clinical response
      with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have
      generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial
      clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients
      with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included
      confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of
      follow-up was February 25, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the
      median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset
      of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was
      occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been
      discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of
      fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals
      [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to
      intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared
      to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P
      <0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%)
      patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed
      radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative
      reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days
      (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients
      in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis,
      age (Odds ratio [OR]=1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR=0.55 per 100 cells/ul
      increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The
      majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests
      that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy 
      in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general
      population. However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate
      the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. METHODS: Clinical
      records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for
      55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab 
      samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital
      of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020. RESULTS: All 55 
      patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%)
      patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
      Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including
      fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive
      lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56x10(9) cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia
      (from 4.5 to 18.28x10(9) cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented
      normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated
      patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus.
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was
      currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific 
      clinical characteristics to distinguish them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the general susceptibility of new coronaviruses, the clinical 
      characteristics and outcomes of elderly and young patients may be different.
      OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with
      new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study
      of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in
      Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020.
      Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged
      patients. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were evaluated, 18 elderly patients
      (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common
      symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients
      in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation,
      and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the
      elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group
      (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and
      middle-aged group (P<0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V 
      was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged
      group (P<0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group 
      was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P<0.001), and there was 
      no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of
      lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young
      and middle-aged group (P<0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly
      higher in the young group (P<0.001). The Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets, Chinese
      medicine, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were statistically different
      in the elderly group and the young and middle-aged group, and the P values were
      all <0.05.

AB  - Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite
      drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is 
      the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by
      pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities
      have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the
      search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In
      the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a
      public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of
      chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was
      previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including
      SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of
      COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we
      discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2
      replication cycle.

AB  - Objective: To understand the viral genomic characteristics of a 2019-nCoV strain 
      in the first COVID-19 patient found in Hangzhou, China. Methods: Viral RNA was
      extracted in throat swab and sputum sample of the patient and was performed
      real-time reverse transcription PCR detection and obtained viral genome by
      high-throughput sequencing method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 29
      2019-nCoV genomes and 30 beta-coronavirus genomes deposited in NCBI GenBank.
      Fifteen genomes from Wuhan were grouped by mutation sites and others were
      identified by Wuhan's or specific mutation sites. Results: A 29 833 bp length
      genome of the first 2019-nCoV strain in Hangzhou was obtained, covering full
      length of the coding regions of coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
      the genome was closest to the genome of a bat SARS-like coronavirus strain RaTG13
      with an identity of 96.11% (28 666/29 826). Among the genes between two genomes, 
      E genes were highly conserved (99.56%), while S genes had lowest identity
      (92.87%), suggesting that S gene was of a faster evolutionary rate. The genome
      sequence similarities among 29 strains from China (Hangzhou, Wuhan, and
      Shenzhen), Japan, USA, and Finland, were all more than 99.9%; however, some
      single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in some strains. Conclusion: The 
      genome of Hangzhou 2019-nCoV strain was very close to the genomes of strains from
      other cities in China and overseas collected at early epidemic phase. The
      2019-nCoV genome sequencing method used in this paper provides an useful tool for
      monitoring variation of viral genes.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of the severe or critically
      ill patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), and evaluate the impact
      of complicated myocardial injury on the prognosis of these patients. Methods: A
      retrospective study was conducted in 54 patients who admitted to Tongji hospital 
      from February 3, 2020 to February 24, 2020 and met the criteria of severe or
      critical conditions of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and hospital
      mortality rate were analyzed and compared between the patients with or without
      myocardial injury, which was defined with 3 times higher serum cardiac troponin
      value. Results: The median age of the 54 patients was 68 (59.8, 74.3) years.
      Among all the patients, 24 (44.4%) patients were complicated with hypertension,
      13 (24.1%) with diabetes, 8 (14.8%) with coronary heart disease, and 3 (5.6%)
      with previous cerebral infarction. During hospitalization, 24 (44.4%) of the
      patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26 (48.1%) patients died in 
      hospital. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with
      myocardial injury than in patients without myocardial injury (14 (60.9%) vs. 8
      (25.8%), P=0.013). Moreover, the levels of C-reactive protein (153.6 (80.3,
      240.7) ng/L vs. 49.8 (15.9, 101.9) ng/L) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
      peptide (852.0 (400.0, 2 315.3) ng/L vs. 197.0 (115.3, 631.0) ng/L) were
      significantly higher than patients without myocardial injury (all P<0.01).
      Conclusions: Prevalence of myocardial injury is high among severe or critically
      ill COVID-19 patients. Severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients with myocardial
      injury face a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The study
      suggests that it is important to monitor and manage the myocardial injury during 
      hospitalization for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics
      of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a
      detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well
      described. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included 
      all adult inpatients (>/=18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from
      Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been
      discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and
      laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted
      from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.
      We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the 
      risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from 
      Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this
      study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had
      a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients),
      followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%]
      patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death
      associated with older age (odds ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.17, per year increase; 
      p=0.0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5.65,
      2.61-12.23; p<0.0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/L (18.42, 2.64-128.55;
      p=0.0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20.0 days (IQR
      17.0-24.0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in
      non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was
      37 days. INTERPRETATION: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA
      score, and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/L could help clinicians to identify
      patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides
      the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal
      antiviral interventions in the future. FUNDING: Chinese Academy of Medical

AB  - BACKGROUND: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding
      the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness
      of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained
      transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we
      estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 
      2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained
      human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were
      introduced. METHODS: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on
      cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases
      that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during
      January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated
      the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other
      areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a
      stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on 
      cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets
      we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack
      thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in
      Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 
      2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019,
      and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights
      between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for
      comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or 
      lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most
      at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new 
      confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.
      FINDINGS: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan
      declined from 2.35 (95% CI 1.15-4.77) 1 week before travel restrictions were
      introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1.05 (0.41-2.39) 1 week after. Based on our
      estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations
      with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at 
      least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the
      infection will establish within that population. INTERPRETATION: Our results show
      that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, 
      coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive
      in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before
      these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to
      establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually. FUNDING:

AB  - In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported
      in Wuhan, China. A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious
      pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus. This causative virus has been
      temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic
      is spreading in China and all over the world now. The purpose of this review is
      primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of 
      COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on 
      the current evidences. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Understanding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mode of host cell
      recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives. The spike protein of
      coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. METHODS: In
      this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose
      Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling
      docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled
      using its counterpart, the SARS spike. RESULTS: Sequence and structural
      alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence
      and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was
      performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78
      Substrate Binding Domain beta (SBDbeta). The docking pose revealed the
      involvement of the SBDbeta of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the
      coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and 
      IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main
      driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of
      -9.8kcal/mol. These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific
      against COVID-19.

AB  - An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2,
      previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
      spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020,
      World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a
      public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2,
      since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third
      introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the
      human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of
      87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of
      China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several
      independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to
      beta-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to
      bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads
      through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed
      sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the 
      globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue
      and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. 
      The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and 
      prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific
      antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed 
      drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest
      research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics
      of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to
      combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.

AB  - Novel coronavirus has become a global health hazard and its high infectivity is
      alarming. The imaging findings of the 2019-nCoV infection in our young diabetic
      patient featured ground-glass opacities and consolidations in both lungs. The
      lung lesions may involute rapidly during the course. The patient showed
      improvement both clinically and on computed tomography imaging at discharged
      after 2 weeks'treatment. Computed tomography scans of patients helped monitor the
      changes continuously, which could timely provide the information of the evolution
      of the disease or therapeutic effect to clinicians.

      Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease
      that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide.
      Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been
      well delineated. Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes
      in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) or died. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort 
      study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan
      Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The 
      final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19
      pneumonia. Main Outcomes and Measures: The development of ARDS and death.
      Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and
      outcome data were also collected and analyzed. Results: Of 201 patients, the
      median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%)
      patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84
      patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who
      did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30
      of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%])
      and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of
      117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and
      diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively
      [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis,
      risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to
      death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR,
      6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI,
      1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and
      coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI,
      1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 
      95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever
      (>/=39 degrees C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 
      1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI,
      0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased
      the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72). Conclusions and Relevance: Older
      age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely
      owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated with
      the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among
      patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial
      for patients who develop ARDS.

AB  - Starting around December 2019, an epidemic of pneumonia, which was named COVID-19
      by the World Health Organization, broke out in Wuhan, China, and is spreading
      throughout the world. A new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International
      Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was soon found to be the cause. At present, the 
      sensitivity of clinical nucleic acid detection is limited, and it is still
      unclear whether it is related to genetic variation. In this study, we retrieved
      95 full-length genomic sequences of SARAS-CoV-2 strains from the National Center 
      for Biotechnology Information and GISAID databases, established the reference
      sequence by conducting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses, and
      analyzed sequence variations along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The homology among all 
      viral strains was generally high, among them, 99.99% (99.91%-100%) at the
      nucleotide level and 99.99% (99.79%-100%) at the amino acid level. Although
      overall variation in open-reading frame (ORF) regions is low, 13 variation sites 
      in 1a, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8, and N regions were identified, among which positions
      nt28144 in ORF 8 and nt8782 in ORF 1a showed mutation rate of 30.53% (29/95) and 
      29.47% (28/95), respectively. These findings suggested that there may be
      selective mutations in SARS-COV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions
      when designing primers and probes. Establishment of the reference sequence for
      SARS-CoV-2 could benefit not only biological study of this virus but also
      diagnosis, clinical monitoring and intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
      future.

AB  - A new coronavirus, referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the recent
      outbreak of severe respiratory disease. This outbreak first detected in Wuhan,
      China in December 2019, has spread to other regions of China and to 25 other
      countries as of January, 2020. It has been known since the 2003 SARS epidemic
      that the receptor critical for SARS-CoV entry into host cells is the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S1 domain of the spike protein of
      SARS-CoV attaches the virus to its cellular receptor ACE2 on the host cells. We
      thought that it is timely to explain the connection between the SARS-CoV,
      SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and the rationale for soluble ACE2 as a potential therapy.

      to diagnose patient with COVID-19?]
PG  - E003

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raging in China, especially in Hubei
      Province, which has resulted great dangers in people's life and national economy.
      According to the guidelines drafted by China's Center for Disease prevention and 
      Control (CDC), the positive nucleic acid test is need to the diagnosis of patient
      with COVID-19. Upper respiratory tract specimens are the main sources for nucleic
      acid detection. However, based on international guidelines of COVID-19 , no
      recommended level of upper respiratory tract sampling method is proposed.
      Therefore, which kind of sampling methods should be chosen to help the COVID-19
      diagnosis and which way is the most secure for doctors and nurses is our concern.
      In this review, we analyzed a total of 10 literatures on the sampling methods of 
      upper respiratory tract related to infectious diseases such as severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (MERS), and influenza A (H1N1), which were spread worldwide in past
      years. Literatures were collected from the three dimensions of sampling method,
      sampling time, and sampling safety. It was found that among all the upper
      respiratory sampling methods, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) had a higher positive
      rate within 2 weeks of symptom onset, while combined nasal and oropharyngeal
      swabs (NS + OPS) was the least harmful to medical staff during sampling. We wish 
      this review is helpful for the prevention of COVID-19.

AB  - There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and 
      spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was
      transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei
      province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date
      (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected
      droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are
      usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others.
      The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with
      comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case
      fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration
      of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common
      laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated
      C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually
      abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially
      supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails
      home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict
      infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet
      precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. 
      The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.

AB  - The new coronavirus outbreak gets everyone's attention. China's national actions 
      against the outbreak have contributed great contributions to the world. China has
      been learning from practice for better reporting and is fast to adapt itself. In 
      this article we discuss China's practice in public reporting and its implications
      to global health. Confirmed cases, dynamic suspected cases, recovered cases, and 
      deaths have been reported both in accumulative numbers and their daily updates.
      Some ratio indictors reporting (fatality rate, recovery rate, etc.), trend
      reporting, and global surveillance have been applied as well. Some improvements
      can still be made. It is necessary to further explore the influential factors
      behind the indicators for interventions. Recommendations are made to the World
      Health Organization and other countries for better public reporting and
      surveillance.

AB  - As of 22 February 2020, more than 77662 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have been
      documented globally with over 2360 deaths. Common presentations of confirmed
      cases include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum
      production, shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged
      prothrombin time, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate
      dehydrogenase. The reported severe/critical case ratio is approximately 7-10% and
      median time to intensive care admission is 9.5-10.5 days with mortality of around
      1-2% varied geographically. Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus,
      there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed
      the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid
      and supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial. In China,
      Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial
      guidelines with substantial utilization. We reviewed the latest national and
      provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series
      regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine. We have also
      reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management with
      hypothesized mechanisms and latest in silico findings to identify candidate
      Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management. Given 
      the paucity of strongly evidence-based regimens, the available data suggest that 
      Chinese medicine could be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic option in the
      management of COVID-19.

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2,
      leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. At present,
      there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an
      important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and 
      ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system
      inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe
      pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively
      relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding
      of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang
      (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was
      broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia.
      Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients
      with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and
      might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.

AB  - Objective: To summarize and analyze the clinical and imaging characteristics of
      patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in the early stage in Beijing.
      Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data of 9 patients with
      2019 novel coronavirus infection diagnosed in one fever clinicic in Beijing from 
      January 18, 2020 to February 3, 2020. Results: 5 male and 4 female was included
      in those 9 patients, whose median age was 36 years, and the age range from 15 to 
      49 years. 8 of these patients had no underlying disease and one suffered from
      diabetes. 7 patients had a history of travel to Wuhan City or Hubei Province, and
      one patient was a medical staff. Two family clustered was found. The incubation
      period was 1 to 6 days. The clinical manifestations were fever in 8 cases (8/9) ,
      dry cough in 5 cases (5/9) , pharyngalgia in 4 cases (4/9) , fatigue in 4 cases
      (4/9) , body soreness in 4 cases (4/9) , and blocked or watery nose in 1 case
      (1/9) . Six patients (6/9) had abnormal cell peripheral blood, of which 3 (3/9)
      had an increased monocyte count, 2 (2/9) had a reduced lymphocyte, and 1 (1/9)
      had an increased leukocyte count, while the 3 patients had normal cell blood
      routines. The median of CRP was 16.3 mg/L, including 5 patients with slightly
      elevated (5/9) , 4 patients with normal values (4/9) . the results of
      procalcitonin test were negative in5 patients. Three patients were examined by
      chest X-ray examination, one of which was normal, one case showed infiltrates of 
      right upper lung, and another showed in right lower lung. All patients underwent 
      chest HRCT. And 7 cases (7/9) showed multiple ground glass exudation, including 5
      cases (5/7) involved bilateral lungs, 2 cases (2/7) involved unilateral lung, 3
      cases (3/7) with patchy consolidation, and 2 cases (2/9) showed no abnormality.
      Conclusions: The patents with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in this study
      generally have an epidemiological history. The clinical manifestations are fever 
      and cough. Peripheral white blood cell counts were most normal And PCT were all
      negative. Chest HRCT manifested as multiple ground-glass opacities with partly
      consolidation. Some patients had normal chest radiographs but HRCT showed
      pneumonia. Some patients had no pneumonia on chest HRCT.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics of medical staff with
      novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP). Methods: 30 patients infected with novel
      coronavirus referred to jianghan university hospital between January 11, 2020 and
      January 3, 2020 were studied. The data reviewed included those of clinical
      manifestations, laboratory investigation and Radiographic features. Results: The 
      patients consisted of 10 men and 20 women, including 22 doctors and 8 nurses,aged
      21~59 years(mean 35+/-8 years).They were divided to 26 common type and 4 severe
      cases, all of whom had close(within 1m) contact with patients infected of novel
      coronavirus pneumonia. The average contact times were 12 (7,16) and the average
      cumulative contact time was 2 (1.5,2.7) h.Clinical symptoms of these patients
      were fever in 23 patients (76.67%) , headache in 16 petients (53.33%) , fatigue
      or myalgia in 21patients (70%) , nausea, vomiting or diarrhea in 9 petients (30%)
      , cough in 25 petients (83.33%) , and dyspnea in 14 petients (46.67%) .Routine
      blood test revealed WBC<4.0x10(9)/L in 8 petients (26.67%) , (4-10) x10(9)/L in
      22 petients (73.33%) , and WBC>4.0x10(9)/L in 4 petients (13.33%) during the
      disease.Lymphocyte count<1.0x10(9)/L occurred in 12 petients (40%),abnormal liver
      function in 7 petients (23.33%) ,myocardial damage in 5 petients(16.67%),
      elevated D-dimer (>0.5mg/l) in 5 patients (16.67%). Compared with normal
      patients, the average exposure times, cumulative exposure time, BMI, Fever time, 
      white blood cell count, liver enzyme, LDH, myoenzyme and D-dimer were
      significantly increased in severe patients, while the lymphocyte count and
      albumin levels in peripheral blood were significantly decreased.Chest CT mainly
      showed patchy shadows and interstitial changes.According to imaging examination, 
      11 patients (36.67%) showed Unilateral pneumonia and 19 patients (63.33%) showed 
      bilateral pneumonia,4 patients (13.33%) showed bilateral multiple mottling and
      ground-glass opacity.Compared with the patients infected in the protected period,
      the proportion of severe infection and bilateral pneumonia were both increased in
      the patients infected in unprotected period. Conclusion: Medical staffs are at
      higher risk of infection.Infection rates are associated with contact time, the
      amount of suction virus. Severe patients had BMI increased, heating time
      prolonged, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer and albumin level
      significantly changed and were prone to be complicated with liver damage and
      myocardial damage.Strict protection measures is important to prevent infection
      for medical workers.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) pneumonia and to investigate the correlation between serum
      inflammatory cytokines and severity of the disease. Methods: 29 patients with
      2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji 
      medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 
      were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data were collected and the general
      information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were
      analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were
      divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5
      cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the 
      serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the
      three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the
      clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of
      2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other
      systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial
      infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or
      decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29),
      increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal
      procalcitonin. In most patients, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was
      significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased (15/29). Alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil),
      serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT
      findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows
      accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion
      increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the
      solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant
      differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6
      in the serum of the three groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was
      higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mild group.
      However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte
      count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: The clinical
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral
      pneumonia. High resolution CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis of 
      this disease. The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to 
      predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients.

AB  - Infection with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is mainly transmitted by
      respiratory droplets, airborne transmission and direct contact. However,
      conducting bronchoscopy on patients with 2019-nCoV is a high-risk procedure in
      which health care workers are directly exposed to the virus, and the protection
      and operation procedures need to be strictly regulated. According to the
      characteristics of bronchoscopy, it is necessary to formulate the procedure,
      requirements and precautions when conducting bronchoscopy in the current epidemic
      situation. Relevant standards for preventing from infections should be strictly
      implemented in the operation of bronchoscopy. It needs to emphasize that
      bronchoscopy should not be used as a routine means for the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV
      infection sampling. The indications for bronchoscopy for other diseases should be
      strictly mastered, and it is suggested that bronchoscopy should be postponed for 
      those patients who is not in urgent situation.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) diseases (such as SARS, MERS, pH1N1)
      can rapidly progress to acute respiratory failure with high lethality. The
      outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection can lead to 15%~ 30% patients
      developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Respiratory support
      is the most important therapy for SARI patients with respiratory failure.
      However, respiratory support is a high skilled technology, which means
      inappropriate application may bring related complications and cross infection of 
      SARI pathogens among medical staff and non-medical personnel in hospital.
      Therefore, it is meaningful to established a standardized indication of
      respiratory support and to prevent related nosocomial transmission in SARI
      patients.

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak in
      Wuhan, and has quickly spread to all provinces in China and 26 other countries
      around the world, leading to a serious situation for epidemic prevention. So far,
      there is still no specific medicine. Previous studies have shown that chloroquine
      phosphate (chloroquine) had a wide range of antiviral effects, including
      anti-coronavirus. Here we found that treating the patients diagnosed as novel
      coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success rate of
      treatment, shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome. In order to guide
      and regulate the use of chloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia,
      the multicenter collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of
      Guangdong Province and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in
      the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia developed this expert consensus
      after extensive discussion. It recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, 500mg
      twice per day for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe
      cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia and without contraindications to
      chloroquine.

AB  - The new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), also named as COVID-19 by WHO on Feb 11
      2020, is now causing a severe public health emergency in China since. The number 
      of diagnosed cases is more than 40,000 until the submission of this manuscript.
      Coronavirus has caused several epidemic situations world widely, but the present 
      contagious disease caused by 2019 new coronavirus is unprecedentedly fulminating.
      The published cohorts of 2019 new coronavirus (n-Cov) are single-center studies, 
      or retrospective studies. We here share the therapeutic experiences of NCP
      treatment with literature review. Combination of Ribavirin and interferon-alpha
      is recommended by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised
      Edition) because of the effect on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and
      the effectiveness of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Remdisivir needs to be confirmed by 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), given the situation of no specific antivirus
      drug on NCP is unavailable. Systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended as a
      short term use (1~2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), 3~5 d) by the 5(th) edition National Health 
      Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) yet RCTs are expected to confirm the
      effectiveness. Inappropriate application of antibiotics should be avoided,
      especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics, for the NCP is not
      often complicated with bacterial infection.

AB  - The recent outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, China is caused by a novel
      coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which is genetically close to a bat-derived
      coronavirus. 2019-nCoV is categorized as beta genus coronavirus, same as the two 
      other strains-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle
      East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Antiviral drugs commonly used
      in clinical practice, including neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, paramivir,
      zanamivir, etc.), ganciclovir, acyclovir and ribavirin, are invalid for 2019-nCoV
      and not recommended. Drugs are possibly effective for 2019-nCoV include:
      remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with
      interferon-beta, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies. But the efficacy
      and safety of these drugs for 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients need to be assessed by
      further clinical trials.

AB  - In December 2019, the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, 
      attracting attention worldwidely. The novel coronavirus has the characteristics
      of rapid transmission, atypical clinical symptoms, and easy to affect both lungs,
      leading to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis, as well as difficult to detection
      and assessment at early stage. Fever, cough, myalgia, weakness, dyspnea and
      imagings may be helpful for the early detection of novel coronavirus pneumonia.
      At the same time, the rate of disease progression, fever, CT manifestations,
      hypoxia degree, age, basic diseases, and laboratory indicators can also be used
      to evaluate the severity of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.

AB  - At the end of 2019, sporadic and clustered case with "pneumonia of unknown
      origin" emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province. The causative pathogen was quickly
      confirmed as "2019-nCoV" . The epidemic soon spread throughout the country and
      became a pandemic in over a month. Government and medical institutions across the
      country mobilized all kinds of resources and took a variety of measures to
      actively treat patients and stop the epidemic. Based on current studies, the
      author summarized the clinical characteristics and evolution of the novel viral
      pneumonia, and proposed the key points of diagnosis and treatment, the scientific
      management of both confirmed and suspected cases, and the scientific management
      of disease prevention and control.

      modeling. Methods: Deterministic mathematical model(SEIHR) has been established
      to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of confirmed patients in Daegu and North 
      Gyeongsang Province(Daegu/NGP), the main area of outbreak, were used. The first
      patient's symptom onset date was assumed on 22-Jan. We estimate the reproduction 
      number(R), and the effect of preventive measures, assuming that the effect has
      been shown from 29-Feb. or 5-Mar. Results: The estimated R in Hubei Province was 
      4.2655, while the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.5555, but later in
      Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.4721 and 3.5428. When the transmission period 
      decreases from 4 days to 2 days, the outbreak finished early, but the peak of the
      epidemic has increased, and the total number of patients has not changed much. If
      transmission rate decreases about 90% or 99%, the outbreak finished early, and
      the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreased. Conclusion:
      To early end of the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus 
      such as social distancing and mask wearing are absolutely crucial with the
      participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission
      period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through efforts
      by the quarantine authorities.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 has become an important public health issue in the world. 
      More than 118 000 cases were confirmed around the world. The main clinical
      manifestations were respiratory symptoms and occasional gastrointestinal
      symptoms. However, there is no unified standard for the diagnosis and treatment
      of COVID-19. In the retrospective analysis, we report nine cases of COVID-19,
      describe the history of contact, clinical manifestations, the course of diagnosis
      and clinical treatment before, during and after treatment.

LID - 10.1002/minf.202000028 [doi]
AB  - The recently emerged 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and associated COVID-19 
      disease cause serious or even fatal respiratory tract infection and yet no
      approved therapeutics or effective treatment is currently available to
      effectively combat the outbreak. This urgent situation is pressing the world to
      respond with the development of novel vaccine or a small molecule therapeutics
      for SARS-CoV-2. Along these efforts, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease
      (Mpro) has been rapidly resolved and made publicly available to facilitate global
      efforts to develop novel drug candidates. Recently, our group has developed a
      novel deep learning platform - Deep Docking (DD) which provides fast prediction
      of docking scores of Glide (or any other docking program) and, hence, enables
      structure-based virtual screening of billions of purchasable molecules in a short
      time. In the current study we applied DD to all 1.3 billion compounds from ZINC15
      library to identify top 1,000 potential ligands for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein. The 
      compounds are made publicly available for further characterization and
      development by scientific community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. OBJECTIVE: To 
      describe chest CT findings in children with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      studied children at a large tertiary-care hospital in China, during the period
      from 28 January 2019 to 8 February 2020, who had positive reverse transcriptase
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19. We recorded findings at any
      chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical
      observations. RESULTS: We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age
      (mean 3.4 years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of
      these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days,
      respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass
      opacities; all normalised during treatment. CONCLUSION: Compared to reports in
      adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small
      paediatric cohort.

LID - ciaa247 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa247 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has raised world concern since it
      emerged in Wuhan Hubei China in December, 2019. The infection may result into
      severe pneumonia with clusters illness onsets. Its impacts on public health make 
      it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias. METHODS:
      Nineteen 2019-nCoV pneumonia (NCOVID-19) and fifteen other pneumonia patients
      (NON-NCOVID-19) in out of Hubei places were involved in this study. Both
      NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19 patients were confirmed to be infected in throat
      swabs or/and sputa with or without 2019-nCoV by real-time RT-PCR. We analyzed the
      demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features from those
      patients, and compared the difference between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19.
      RESULTS: All patients had a history of exposure to confirmed case of 2019-nCoV or
      travel to Hubei before illness. The median duration, respectively, was 8
      (IQR:6~11) and 5 (IQR:4~11) days from exposure to onset in NCOVID-19 and
      NON-NCOVID-19. The clinical symptoms were similar between NCOVID-19 and
      NON-NCOVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Fifteen (78.95%)
      NCOVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while
      17 (89.47%) NCOVID-19 but 1 (6.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had multiple mottling 
      and ground-glass opacity of chest CT images. Compared to NON-NCOVID-19, NCOVID-19
      present remarkably more abnormal laboratory tests including AST, ALT, gamma-GT,
      LDH and alpha-HBDH. CONCLUSION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused similar onsets to 
      other pneumonias. CT scan may be a reliable test for screening NCOVID-19 cases.
      Liver function damage is more frequent in NCOVID-19 than NON-NCOVID-19 patients. 
      LDH and alpha-HBDH may be considerable markers for evaluation of NCOVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in
      Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data
      of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January
      10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed. The data of laboratory
      examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared
      between severe and non-severe patients. RESULTS: Of the 452 patients with
      COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection. The median age was 58
      years and 235 were male. The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of
      breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia. Severe cases tend to have 
      lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and
      neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes,
      eosinophils, and basophils. Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of 
      infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines. The number of T cells
      significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases. Both helper T cells
      and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and
      lower level of helper T cells in severe group. The percentage of naive helper T
      cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe cases. Patients
      with COVID-19 also have lower level of regulatory T cells, and more obviously
      damaged in severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus might mainly act on
      lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets
      is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis and treatment of
      COVID-19.

TI  - Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Now is the time to refresh
      pandemic plans.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - This article outlines practical steps that businesses can take now to prepare for
      a pandemic. Given the current growing spread of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) around the world, it is imperative that businesses review their
      pandemic plans and be prepared in case this epidemic expands and affects more
      people and communities. Preparing for a potential infectious disease pandemic
      from influenza or a novel corona virus is an essential component of a business
      continuity plan, especially for businesses that provide critical healthcare and
      infrastructure services. Although many businesses and organisations have a
      pandemic plan or address pandemic preparedness in their business continuity
      plans, few have recently tested and updated their plans. Pandemics can not only
      interrupt an organisation's operations and compromise long-term viability of an
      enterprise, but also disrupt the provision of critical functions. Businesses that
      regularly test and update their pandemic plan can significantly reduce harmful
      impacts to the business, play a key role in protecting employees' and customers' 
      health and safety, and limit the negative impact of a pandemic on the community
      and economy.

      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic and associated events

      fight against outbreaks and epidemics.

AB  - In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and
      later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and
      rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world,
      despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the 
      original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic
      information systems and methods, including, among other application
      possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of
      social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using
      population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and
      contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and
      effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and
      describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and
      applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated
      events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications
      are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of
      them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had
      any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support
      the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.

TI  - From SARS and MERS CoVs to SARS-CoV-2: Moving toward more biased codon usage in
      viral structural and nonstructural genes.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25754 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an
      emerging disease with fatal outcomes. In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap 
      question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and
      pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with
      the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome
      (MERS) coronaviruses. METHODS: The genome composition, nucleotide analysis, codon
      usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage, and effective number of codons
      (ENc) were analyzed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E),
      membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important
      nonstructural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and main protease
      (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoVs.
      RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most
      high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare
      codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5 to 20
      lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs. This implies
      higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural 
      proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over-biased and negatively
      biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc
      values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Extreme bias and 
      lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope, and Mpro genes,
      are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat
      SARS, and MERS CoVs.

      real-time surveillance and evaluation with a second derivative model.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s41256-020-00137-4 [doi]
AB  - Background: Similar to outbreaks of many other infectious diseases, success in
      controlling the novel 2019 coronavirus infection requires a timely and accurate
      monitoring of the epidemic, particularly during its early period with rather
      limited data while the need for information increases explosively. Methods: In
      this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus
      epidemic in China with cumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months.
      The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population
      assumption. This model was built with the data and used to assess the detection
      rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true
      infections, detectable and detected cases. Results: Results from the second
      derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus epidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in 
      nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to
      massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indicated by results from
      both second derivative and exponential modeling analyses. The epidemic started to
      decelerate immediately after the massive actions. The results derived from our
      analysis signaled the decline of the epidemic 14 days before it eventually
      occurred on February 4, 2020. Study findings further signaled an accelerated
      decline in the epidemic starting in 14 days on February 18, 2020. Conclusions:
      The coronavirus epidemic appeared to be nonlinear and chaotic, and was responsive
      to effective interventions. The methods used in this study can be applied in
      surveillance to inform and encourage the general public, public health
      professionals, clinicians and decision-makers to take coordinative and
      collaborative efforts to control the epidemic.

TI  - Harnessing the immune system via FcgammaR function in immune therapy: A pathway
      to next-gen mAbs.
LID - 10.1111/imcb.12326 [doi]
AB  - The human FcgammaRs interact with antigen-complexed IgG ligands to both activate 
      and modulate a powerful network of inflammatory host-protective effector
      functions that are key to the normal physiology of immune resistance to
      pathogens. More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or
      in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcgammaR-mediated
      effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies
      targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is
      also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralise or remove small
      macromolecules such as cytokines or other immunoglobulins. The use of mAb
      therapeutics has also revealed a "scaffolding" role for FcgammaR which, in
      different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune
      agonism or may trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic 
      need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as
      SARS-CoV-2, requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel
      mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FcgammaR
      function and the complexity of the relationships between FcgammaRs and antibodies
      is fuelling efforts to develop more potent "next-gen" therapeutic antibodies.
      Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of 
      the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of
      individual activating FcgammaRs or the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb or alternatively,
      for the ablation of FcgammaR interaction altogether. This review touches on
      recent aspects FcgammaR and IgG immunobiology and its relationship to the present
      and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Following the public-health emergency of international concern
      (PHEIC) declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and
      the recent outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [officially
      renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] in China
      and 29 other countries, we aimed to summarise the clinical aspects of the
      novelBetacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its possible clinical presentations
      together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require
      antimicrobial treatment. METHODS: The currently available literature was reviewed
      for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time
      of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed
      database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included 'novel coronavirus' or
      '2019-nCoV' or 'COVID-19'. RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age
      range, 8-92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were 
      commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were
      surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series
      available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral
      lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass
      opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at
      least in the early phases of the disease. CONCLUSION: The new 2019-nCoV epidemic 
      is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs.
      However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory
      co-morbidities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There's an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection
      since December 2019, first in China, and currently with more than 80 thousand
      confirmed infection globally in 29 countries till March 2, 2020. Identification, 
      isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human
      transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
      health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR
      detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly
      established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in
      this COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: 4880 cases that had respiratory infection
      symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China,
      were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on
      samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups
      divided by genders or ages. RESULTS: The positive rate was about 38% for the
      total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive
      rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics.
      Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk
      factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we
      concluded that viral NAT played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2
      infection.

AB  - In the WHO European Region, COVID-19 surveillance was implemented 27 January
      2020. We detail the first European cases. As at 21 February, nine European
      countries reported 47 cases. Among 38 cases studied, 21 were linked to two
      clusters in Germany and France, 14 were infected in China. Median case age was 42
      years; 25 were male. Late detection of the clusters' index cases delayed
      isolation of further local cases. As at 5 March, there were 4,250 cases.

TI  - Development of a Laboratory-safe and Low-cost Detection Protocol for SARS-CoV-2
      of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
LID - 10.5607/en20009 [doi]
AB  - The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in
      December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly to over a dozen countries.
      Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries.
      This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via
      respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through
      surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically,
      there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even
      before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost,
      easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed.
      Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based
      assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via
      pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This
      protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we
      tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less 
      than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to 
      be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for
      early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories
      that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly developed protocol should be
      helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further
      prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly
      propagating virus.

TI  - Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage
      of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population 
      in China.
LID - E1729 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17051729 [doi]
AB  - Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health
      emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological
      resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to
      reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the
      epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to
      better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and 
      stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used
      for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted
      an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected 
      information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact
      history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary
      measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to
      COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised 
      (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and
      Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194
      cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of
      the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive 
      symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported
      moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home 
      (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%);
      and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).
      Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia,
      dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly
      associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels 
      of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate
      health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular
      precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with 
      a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety,
      and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 
      outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological
      impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe
      anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of
      psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to
      formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable 
      groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - Objective: To understand the clinical characteristics, change of liver function, 
      influencing factors and prognosis in hospitalized patients with coronavirus
      disease-19 (COVID-19) combined with liver injury. Methods: The general
      conditions, biochemical indicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine
      blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with
      COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital were retrospectively
      analyzed. The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of
      liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver
      function group were compared. The mean of two samples in univariate analysis was 
      compared by t-test and analysis of variance. The counting data was measured by
      chi(2) tests. The non-normal distribution measurement data were described by the 
      median, and the non-parametric test was used. Statistically significant
      influencing factors were used as the independent variables in univariate
      analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the main
      influencing factors of liver injury. Results: Of the 40 cases, 25 were male
      (62.5%) and 15 were female (37.5%), aged 22 to 83 (53.87 +/- 15.84) years. Liver 
      injury was occurred in 22 cases (55%) during the course of the disease. Alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was initially
      increased (4.4 to 3.5 times of the normal value) along with decrease of albumin
      in the second week, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
      Ten cases (43.5%) had highest abnormal total blood bilirubin (54.1 mumol/ L).
      There was no correlation between the increase in transaminase and the increase in
      total blood bilirubin (R = -0.006, P = 0.972). Three cases had prothrombin
      activity (PTA) of </= 50%, 10 cases had elevated FDP, and 13 cases had elevated
      D-dimer, all of whom were severe or critically ill. Liver function injury was
      more likely to occur in patients who used many types of drugs and large amounts
      of hormones (P = 0.002, P = 0.031), and there was no correlation with the TA6TA7 
      mutation in the UGT1A1 * 28 gene locus. Multiple regression analysis showed that 
      the occurrence of liver injury was only related to critical illness. The liver
      function of all patients had recovered within one week after conventional liver
      protection treatment. Conclusion: COVID-19 combined with liver function injury
      may be due to the slight elevation of transaminase, mostly around the second week
      of the disease course. Severe patients have a higher proportion of liver injury, 
      and critical type is an independent risk factor for liver injury.

LID - AAC.00399-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00399-20 [doi]
AB  - Currently, the expansion of the novel human respiratory coronavirus (known as:
      SARS-CoV-2, COVID-2019, or 2019-nCoV) has stressed the need for therapeutic
      alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic. The previous epidemics of
      high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona
      virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could
      be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus
      SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide
      analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. 
      Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures,
      and it displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. In addition, a combination 
      of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors,
      lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-INFb) were shown to be
      effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-INFb also improved clinical
      parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the
      therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of
      LPV/RTV-INFb against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mice model. The
      relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human
      coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, has suggested that
      pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains
      unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics
      that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic 
      infections. This minireview aimed to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds
      that showed potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general
      population. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19
      pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 
      in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19
      infection. METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were
      retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed
      COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted
      to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31,
      2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for 
      the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat
      swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients
      after the first lactation. FINDINGS: All nine patients had a caesarean section in
      their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms,
      including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in
      two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in
      two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1.0 x 10(9) cells per L).
      Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the
      patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine
      livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.
      All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of
      9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples
      from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for
      the virus. INTERPRETATION: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in 
      pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who
      developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest
      that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical
      transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy. FUNDING:

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to
      emerge and represent a serious issue to public health. In the last twenty years, 
      several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most 
      recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first
      identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day,
      an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in
      Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first
      reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019. Published
      literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the
      beginning of December 2019. As they were unable to identify the causative agent, 
      these first cases were classified as "pneumonia of unknown etiology." The Chinese
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an
      intensive outbreak investigation program. The etiology of this illness is now
      attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family. On
      February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,
      announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a "COVID-19," which is the 
      acronym of "coronavirus disease 2019". In the past twenty years, two additional
      coronavirus epidemics have occurred. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic
      beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000
      cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has
      approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases. This
      new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally. In a
      meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR,
      2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four
      countries reporting human-to-human transmission. An additional landmark occurred 
      on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, 
      was recorded in the United States. Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV.
      Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of
      Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one
      that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs). The CoVs have become the major
      pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. They are a large family of
      single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal
      species.[1] For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species
      barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more
      severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. Interestingly, these latter viruses have
      probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts - the
      Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV - before 
      jumping to humans. The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is
      speculation that it also has an animal origin. The potential for these viruses to
      grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk.
      Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the "very
      high" level, on February 28, 2020. Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused
      by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving. On March
      11, as the number of COVID-19 cases outside China has increased 13 times and the 
      number of countries involved has tripled with more than 118,000 cases in 114
      countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. World
      governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating
      effects. Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives 
      and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat. At the same time,
      scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the
      transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and
      prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing. Many uncertainties 
      remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the
      epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its
      peak. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are
      only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community
      is our best weapon. Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to a
      progressive reduction of cases in the last few days. In Italy, in geographic
      regions of the north, initially, and subsequently throughout the peninsula,
      political and health authorities are making incredible efforts to contain a shock
      wave that is severely testing the health system. In the midst of the crisis, the 
      authors have chosen to use the "Statpearls" platform because, within the PubMed
      scenario, it represents a unique tool that may allow them to make updates in
      real-time. The aim, therefore, is to collect information and scientific evidence 
      and to provide an overview of the topic that will be continuously updated.

TI  - In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of
      Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
LID - ciaa237 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine
      has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine
      shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety
      profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.
      We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be
      useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill
      SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use 
      of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological
      activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2
      infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were
      implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using
      the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated
      under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst
      considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72
      muM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 muM) in vitro. Based
      on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg
      given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it
      reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice 
      daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more
      potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

TI  - Effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with severe novel coronavirus
      pneumonia: protocol of a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000791 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus outbreak emerged in Wuhan,
      China, and its causative organism has been subsequently designated the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and 
      autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who
      become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract
      symptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to
      subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of
      adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected
      patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and
      warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as
      an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from
      Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to
      an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 
      1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at 
      a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up
      which will be scheduled at 4 consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical
      improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing 
      of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation,
      duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate
      of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The 
      present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in 
      the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the
      management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the
      past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or
      against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients
      with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of 
      severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either
      supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids
      in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV
      requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those
      without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to
      repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV
      related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether
      GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was
      investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. 
      The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 
      2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were
      screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by
      GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential 
      drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles
      were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and
      plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V
      shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and
      uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three
      drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited
      complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 mumol/L. CEP
      demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration
      for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 mumol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells
      treated with 10 mumol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP
      treatment ([6.48 +/- 0.02] x 10vs. 1.00 +/- 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h 
      post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media
      containing 10 mumol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent
      antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 +/- 0.37 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.12, t
      = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 +/- 0.43 vs. [6.18 +/- 0.95] x 10, 
      t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable
      model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are
      potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest
      that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial 
      of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.

AB  - In the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease, investigating,
      classifying, tracking, and managing contacts by identifying the patient's route
      are important for preventing further transmission of the disease. However,
      omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is
      performed through only a proxy interview with the patient. To overcome these
      limitations, methods that can objectively verify the patient's claims (medical
      facility records, Global Positioning System, card transactions, and
      closed-circuit television) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease
      2019 contact investigations in South Korea.

AB  - Objectives: The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
      South Korea was reported in January 2020, with 28 confirmed cases reported as of 
      February 14(th), 2020. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28
      cases were analyzed in response to this disease. Methods: The epidemiological
      characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with
      confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data
      and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response
      team. Results: There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: 
      Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients),
      Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient). The early symptoms were fever, sore 
      throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache. Three patients were 
      asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia. Of the 28 cases, 16 were index
      cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in
      Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients.
      The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family
      members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of
      transmission were mostly at home. Conclusion: COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 
      infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation
      cases. The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at 
      this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home. Establishing an
      early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of
      the disease.

AB  - Objectives: Following reports of patients with unexplained pneumonia at the end
      of December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the causative agent was identified as
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and the 2019 novel coronavirus disease was named
      COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Putative patients with COVID-19 have
      been identified in South Korea, and attempts have been made to isolate the
      pathogen from these patients. Methods: Upper and lower respiratory tract
      secretion samples from putative patients with COVID-19 were inoculated onto cells
      to isolate the virus. Full genome sequencing and electron microscopy were used to
      identify the virus. Results: The virus replicated in Vero cells and cytopathic
      effects were observed. Full genome sequencing showed that the virus genome
      exhibited sequence homology of more than 99.9% with SARS-CoV-2 which was isolated
      from patients from other countries, for instance China. Sequence homology of
      SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was 77.5% and 50%, respectively.
      Coronavirus-specific morphology was observed by electron microscopy in
      virus-infected Vero cells. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from putative
      patients with unexplained pneumonia and intermittent coughing and fever. The
      isolated virus was named BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and then spread rapidly worldwide, 
      particularly to China, Japan, and South Korea. Scientists are endeavoring to find
      antivirals specific to the virus. Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol,
      remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test
      their efficacy and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      in China; some promising results have been achieved thus far. This article
      summarizes agents with potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of
      chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients
      infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientific community 
      should consider this information in light of previous experiments with
      chloroquine in the field of antiviral research.

AB  - The 'Healing the Schism: Epidemiology, Medicine, and the Public's Health' by
      professor Kerr L. White's be published has a history of nearly 30 years. Since
      then, although scholars have appealed to incorporating public health and clinical
      medicine education, and breaking down separations between public health and
      clinical workforce in China, the effect is yet not so obvious. The outbreak of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has opened a public class on the treatment,
      prevention and control of infectious diseases for the Chinese citizens.
      Consequently, the Chinese people have higher expectations on the modernization of
      public health governance, and the social atmosphere of incorporating preventive
      medicine and clinical medical education is establishing. In future, when
      combating with novel infectious diseases and public health emergencies, the
      response capacity of public health system and treatment capacity of clinical
      system will be significantly improved, while the situation on insufficient
      integration of prevention and treatment is bound to be reversed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from
      information on 28 infector-infectee pairs. METHODS: We collected dates of illness
      onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from
      published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively
      ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full
      dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n =
      18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is
      still in its growth phase. RESULTS: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing
      all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible
      interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the 
      median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).
      CONCLUSIONS: The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its
      median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of
      secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial
      interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory
      syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval
      may introduce bias.

      Human Coronavirus Outbreaks.
LID - E186 [pii]

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have become a major public health
      concern since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) outbreak in
      2002. The continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the 
      emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in
      2012. Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2)
      that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019.
      Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The
      number of cases has been mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of
      thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone,
      in addition to thousands of cases in other countries. Although the fatality rate 
      of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly
      contagious based on the number of infected cases to date. In this review, we
      discuss structure, genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and
      provide insights into past and present outbreaks. The future of human CoV
      outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also
      depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal
      with this continuous threat.

AB  - The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 
      China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health
      emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) 
      proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases.
      Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide
      insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we
      demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the
      serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for
      clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we
      show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized
      SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between
      SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral
      intervention.

TI  - Transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak and effectiveness of government
      interventions: A data-driven analysis.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25750 [doi]
AB  - Using the parameterized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, we
      simulated the spread dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and
      impact of different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to
      identify the key factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number
      (R), and performed data fitting after the simulation. By simulation and data
      fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on
      15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the
      fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data-fitting results. More
      rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in
      the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less
      effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the
      development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward
      trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound,
      and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and 
      government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The
      declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the 
      interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was
      significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate
      medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and
      comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat 
      the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions 
      and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.

      (COVID-19): A Chinese perspective.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25749 [doi]
AB  - 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has
      attracted the world's attention over the last month. The Chinese government has
      taken emergency measures to control the outbreak and has undertaken initial steps
      in the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease
      (COVID-19). However, SARS-CoV-2 possesses powerful pathogenicity as well as
      transmissibility and still holds many mysteries that are yet to be solved, such
      as whether the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients or by mothers to
      their infants. Our research presents selected available cases of COVID-19 in
      China to better understand the transmission and diagnosis regarding this
      infectious disease.

AB  - On 31 December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness was reported from
      China and later confirmed as novel coronavirus on 7 January 2020. This virus is
      the same member of the coronavirus family that caused the severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) reported in China 2003, and Middle East
      respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The initial
      cases have been linked to a live seafood market in Wuhan, China, and the specific
      animal source is yet to be determined. The detection of this new virus in humans 
      without knowing the source of the infection has raised greatly heightened
      concerns not only in China, but also internationally. To date, the outbreak has
      spread to most provinces in China and 25 other countries within a relatively
      short period. Consequent to its spread, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director General
      of the World Health Organization (WHO), declared the outbreak a Public Health
      Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and
      reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health
      concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and 
      clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      data on the global outbreak of "2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV" were obtained 
      from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
      (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the
      information from research documents published in global scientific journals
      indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological 
      and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS:
      Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916
      (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27
      states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April
      2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly
      the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 
      (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The
      fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) 
      and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison
      to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has
      diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious
      than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period
      compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was
      higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in
      coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills,
      cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea,
      confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take
      immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging
      pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.

TI  - Emergency management for preventing and controlling nosocomial infection of 2019 
      novel coronavirus: implications for the dermatology department.
LID - 10.1111/bjd.19011 [doi]
AB  - As of Feb 15, 2020, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread
      throughout China and across the world with more than 60,000 laboratory-confirmed 
      cases. Due to the current lack of specific treatment and the risk of transmission
      during the viral incubation period, infection prevention and control of 2019-nCoV
      are both urgent and critical to global health. In this article, we aim to
      highlight the necessity of implementing protective measures, and recommend how to
      set proper emergency management plans for preventing and controlling nosocomial
      infection of 2019-nCoV in dermatology departments.

AB  - In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, identified a cluster of
      pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology linked to the city's South China Seafood
      Market. Subsequent investigations revealed a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as
      the causative agent now at the heart of a major outbreak. The rising case numbers
      have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action, including the
      wholesale isolation of Wuhan. Alongside this has been a robust scientific
      response, including early publication of the pathogen genome, and rapid
      development of highly specific diagnostics. This article will review the new
      knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 acute respiratory disease, and summarise its
      clinical features.

AB  - In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by
      the virus SARS-CoV-2, began in Wuhan, China (1). The disease spread widely in
      China, and, as of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been identified in 36
      other countries and territories, including the United States. Person-to-person
      transmission has been widely documented, and a limited number of countries have
      reported sustained person-to-person spread.* On January 20, state and local
      health departments in the United States, in collaboration with teams deployed
      from CDC, began identifying and monitoring all persons considered to have had
      close contact(dagger) with patients with confirmed COVID-19 (2). The aims of
      these efforts were to ensure rapid evaluation and care of patients, limit further
      transmission, and better understand risk factors for transmission.

AB  - In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as
      the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a
      formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including
      Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our
      country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named
      as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also
      named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan 
      CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth
      category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate
      (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through
      droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection
      control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may
      jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, there is no definite
      treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly
      identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of
      the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.

TI  - Clinical and High-Resolution CT Features of the COVID-19 Infection: Comparison of
      the Initial and Follow-up Changes.
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000674 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In late December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
      in Wuhan, China was caused by a novel coronavirus, newly named severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to quantify severity of
      COVID-19 infection on High-Resolution CT and to determine its relationship with
      clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020,
      the clinical, laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males)
      with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 
      days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the
      severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters,
      initial CT features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with
      Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five (83%)
      patients exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the
      early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, 
      consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms,
      compared to initial CT (all p<0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a
      moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications 
      (R=0.68, p<0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
      lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity
      of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range 0.36-0.75, p<0.05). The highest
      temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were
      significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT
      (p=0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually
      presented with typical ground-grass opacities and other CT features, which showed
      significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements.
      Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from
      illness onset.

TI  - CT Features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia in 62 Patients in
      Wuhan, China.
PG  - 1-8

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan,
      China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and
      describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A
      retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
      pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic 
      radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also
      scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was
      used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used
      to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. 
      RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [+/- SD] age, 52.8 +/-
      12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated.
      Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a
      decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18
      (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had 
      an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen
      on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients
      (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score
      for the upper zone (3.0 +/- 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle
      (4.5 +/- 3.8) and lower (4.5 +/- 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020,
      respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of
      the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area
      (4.4 +/- 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 +/-
      6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients
      (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), 
      GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%),
      microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a
      subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to
      bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11
      (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30
      patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, 
      and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (</= 7
      days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the
      onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of
      GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line,
      a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural 
      effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease.
      CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and
      diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved.
      Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested
      early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in
      advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal
      distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area.
      A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
      level were the most common laboratory findings.

AB  - Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens
      including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 
      and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease
      condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the
      third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The
      continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant
      threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research
      on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to
      treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective 
      vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several
      clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV
      infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help
      scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and
      develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this
      infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for
      passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential
      of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many
      diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic 
      intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the
      neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and
      MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate
      therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging
      pathogen.

AB  - PURPOSE: To discuss the different characteristics of clinical, laboratory, and
      chest computed tomography (CT) in pediatric patients from adults with 2019 novel 
      coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: The clinical, laboratory, and chest CT
      features of 20 pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by
      pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were retrospectively analyzed during
      23 January and 8 February 2020. The clinical and laboratory information was
      obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our 
      hospital. RESULTS: Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified
      history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20,
      60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory
      findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to, which 
      is not common in adults. Coinfection (8/20, 40%) is common in pediatric patients.
      A total of 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10
      with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 4 cases showed no abnormality 
      on chest CT (4/20, 20%). Consolidation with surrounding halo sign was observed in
      10 patients (10/20, 50%), ground-glass opacities were observed in 12 patients
      (12/20, 60%), fine mesh shadow was observed in 4 patients (4/20, 20%), and tiny
      nodules were observed in 3 patients (3/20, 15%). CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin
      elevation and consolidation with surrounding halo signs were common in pediatric 
      patients which were different from adults. It is suggested that underlying
      coinfection may be more common in pediatrics, and the consolidation with
      surrounding halo sign which is considered as a typical sign in pediatric
      patients.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the principles of differential diagnosis of pulmonary
      infiltrates in cancer patients during the outbreak of novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) by analyzing one case of lymphoma who presented pulmonary
      ground-glass opacities (GGO) after courses of chemotherapy. Methods: Baseline
      demographics and clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved
      from medical records. Information of clinical manifestations, history of
      epidemiology, lab tests and chest CT scan images of visiting patients from
      February 13 to February 28 were collected. Literatures about pulmonary
      infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from databases including PUBMED,
      EMBASE and CNKI. Results: Among the 139 cancer patients underwent chest CT scans 
      before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified in eight patients
      (5.8%), five of whom were characterized as GGOs in lungs. 2019-nCoV nuclear acid 
      testing was performed in three patients and the results were negative. One case
      was a 66-year-old man diagnosed as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent CHOP
      chemotherapy regimen. His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs in lungs
      and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes. This patient denied
      any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection and without
      fever and other respiratory symptoms. Considering the negative result of nuclear 
      acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed as viral pneumonia and an 
      experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. Conclusions:
      The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario
      of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients. The epidemic history, clinical
      manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be combined consideration. The
      2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applicated in more selected patients.
      Active anti-infection treatment and surveillance of patient condition should be
      initiated if infectious disease is considered.

PG  - 485-488
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200221-00144 [doi]
AB  - Objective: As the prevention and control of COVID-19continues to advance, the
      active nucleic acid test screening in the close contacts of the patients has been
      carrying out in many parts of China. However, the false-positive rate of positive
      results in the screening has not been reported up to now. But to clearify the
      false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and
      prevention. Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which
      impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the
      information available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive
      results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and
      multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the 
      robustness of the findings. Results: When the infection rate of the close
      contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as
      the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was
      only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%.
      The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the
      base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of
      positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19
      patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals'
      reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives.

      Wuhan, China.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1038/s41421-020-0148-0 [doi]
AB  - An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December
      2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R 0 of Coronavirus
      Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of 
      this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in 
      China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR
      (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the
      epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R t . In the first
      assumption, R t was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of
      infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication 
      of dropping with R t = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach
      11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second
      assumption, R t was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high
      level of transmission (R t = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R t = 0.9 or 0.5)
      owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were
      divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were 
      taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak
      in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the
      peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important
      index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China.
      Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan 
      should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures
      should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases,
      in order to reduce R t to an ideal level and control the infection.

TI  - The Effects of Social Support on Sleep Quality of Medical Staff Treating Patients
      with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January and February 2020 in China.
PG  - e923549

AB  - BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China.
      Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine
      the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study 
      aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and 
      function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and
      February 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS A one-month cross-sectional
      observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19
      infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social
      support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the
      General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR)
      questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support 
      Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis and SEM
      identified the interactions between these factors. RESULTS Levels of social
      support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and
      sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress.
      Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which 
      negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality. Anxiety, stress, and
      self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep
      quality. CONCLUSIONS SEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating
      patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of
      anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy that were dependent on sleep quality and
      social support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To describe the infection control preparedness for Coronavirus
      Disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 [previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus]
      in the first 42 days after announcement of a cluster of pneumonia in China, on 31
      December 2019 (day 1) in Hong Kong. METHODS: A bundle approach of active and
      enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid
      molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers (HCWs)
      with unprotected exposure in the hospitals was implemented. Epidemiological
      characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental and air samples were collected 
      and analyzed. RESULTS: From day 1 to day 42, forty-two (3.3%) of 1275 patients
      fulfilling active (n=29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n=13) confirmed to
      have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The number of locally acquired case significantly
      increased from 1 (7.7%) of 13 [day 22 to day 32] to 27 (93.1%) of 29 confirmed
      case [day 33 to day 42] (p<0.001). Twenty-eight patients (66.6%) came from 8
      family clusters. Eleven (2.7%) of 413 HCWs caring these confirmed cases were
      found to have unprotected exposure requiring quarantine for 14 days. None of them
      was infected and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed.
      Environmental surveillance performed in a patient with viral load of 3.3x106
      copies/ml (pooled nasopharyngeal/ throat swab) and 5.9x106 copies/ml (saliva)
      respectively. SARS-CoV-2 revealed in 1 (7.7%) of 13 environmental samples, but
      not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from patient's chin with or
      without wearing a surgical mask. CONCLUSION: Appropriate hospital infection
      control measures could prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Role of Chest CT in Diagnosis and
      Management.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.22954 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of
      radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance
      of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. The CT features of
      COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to
      familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This
      study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection
      confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years)
      and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). 
      We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports 
      of these 53 patients. The CT images included images from 99 chest CT
      examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image
      reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified
      CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as 
      a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying
      disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT
      study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with
      adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass
      opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement,
      interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features
      of COVID-19. The The "reversed halo" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign 
      are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT
      findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities
      in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute
      respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed
      diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the
      rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT
      is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between
      viruses.

TI  - Genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Coronavirus Disease 2019 patients.
LID - ciaa203 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa203 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 75,000
      individuals and spread to over 20 countries. It is still unclear how fast the
      virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung. 
      METHODS: We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar
      lavage fluid of eight SARS-CoV-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
      patients, and 20 healthy controls. RESULTS: The median number of intra-host
      variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51
      in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those 
      observed in the population data (110 sequences). However, very few intra-host
      variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a
      bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a
      consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism
      data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host
      variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. The
      microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either
      dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory 
      commensal bacteria. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which
      may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. Although how the
      intra-host variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to
      strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and
      associated clinical changes.

AB  - Objective: To identify the characteristics including clinical features and
      pulmonary computed tomography (CT) features of heart failure and novel
      coronavirus pneumonia(COVID-19). Methods: This study was a retrospective study. A
      total of 7 patients with Heart failure and 12 patients with COVID-19 in the
      Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between December 1, 2019 and 
      February 15, 2020 were enrolled. The baseline clinical and imaging features of
      the two groups were statistically analyzed. Results: There was no significant
      difference in age and sex between the two groups, but the incidence of
      epidemiological contact history, fever or respiratory symptoms in the COVID-19
      group was significantly higher than that in the heart failure group (12/12 vs.
      2/7, P=0.001; 12/12 vs. 4/7, P<0.001). While the proportion of cardiovascular
      diseases and impaired cardiac function was significantly less than that of the
      heart failure group(2/12 vs.7/7, P<0.001; 0/12 vs.7/7, P<0.001). For imaging
      features, both groups had ground-glass opacity and thickening of interlobular
      septum, but the ratio of central and gradient distribution was higher in patients
      with heart failure than that in patients with COVID-19 (4/7 vs. 1/12, P=0.04). In
      heart failure group, the ratio of the expansion of small pulmonary veins was also
      higher (3/7 vs. 0, P=0.013), and the lung lesions can be significantly improved
      after effective anti-heart failure treatment. Besides, there are more disease
      with rounded morphology in COVID-19 (9/12 vs. 2/7, P=0.048) . Conclusions: More
      patients with COVID-19 have epidemiological history and fever or respiratory
      symptoms. There are significant differences in chest CT features, such as
      enlargement of pulmonary veins, lesions distribution and morphology between heart
      failure and COVID-19.

TI  - Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.
LID - 10.1002/ddr.21656 [doi]
AB  - At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 
      epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS 
      coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid
      spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing
      vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines
      based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus
      epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus
      strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion
      based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new
      coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R)
      blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and
      mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations
      that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding
      site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic,
      similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This
      commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative
      treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on
      datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.

LID - 10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9 [doi]
AB  - A novel beta-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia
      explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly
      spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was
      different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the 
      bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to
      BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included
      direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and 
      contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous
      membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the
      fetal-oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route.
      The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV
      infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva,
      blood, and other body fluids, and the handling of sharp instruments. Dental
      professionals play great roles in preventing the transmission of 2019-nCoV. Here 
      we recommend the infection control measures during dental practice to block the
      person-to-person transmission routes in dental clinics and hospitals.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of
      an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, now named COVID-19. Most cases and
      sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been
      reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy. Since the symptoms are
      similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers
      arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common 
      infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.

TI  - Relation Between Chest CT Findings and Clinical Conditions of Coronavirus Disease
      (COVID-19) Pneumonia: A Multicenter Study.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.22976 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
      relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19
      pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were
      retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical 
      characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between
      two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease)
      and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old
      accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease
      associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset
      symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such
      as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65
      [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction
      bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to
      have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83
      [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). 
      Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group.
      Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided
      in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients
      with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be
      helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the
      severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or
      mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are
      more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be
      lower lung predominant and multifocal. CT involvement score can help in
      evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.

TI  - Epidemiologic Features and Clinical Course of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2
      in Singapore.
LID - 10.1001/jama.2020.3204 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged 
      in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread globally with sustained
      human-to-human transmission outside China. Objective: To report the initial
      experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak,
      clinical features, and management. Design, Setting, and Participants: Descriptive
      case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 
      to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020. Exposures:
      Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical, laboratory,
      and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from
      nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool. Clinical
      course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and
      intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir. Results: 
      Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
      (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper
      respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx 
      was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six individuals (33%) required
      supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. There were no deaths.
      Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but
      not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with
      lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental
      oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with
      progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with
      lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed 
      abnormal liver function test results. Conclusions and Relevance: Among the first 
      18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical
      presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients
      required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following
      treatment with an antiretroviral agent.

LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00052 [doi]
AB  - The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights an urgent
      need for therapeutics. Through a series of drug repurposing screening campaigns, 
      niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelminthic drug, was found to be effective
      against various viral infections with nanomolar to micromolar potency such as
      SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, ZIKV, HCV, and human adenovirus, indicating its potential as 
      an antiviral agent. In this brief review, we summarize the broad antiviral
      activity of niclosamide and highlight its potential clinical use in the treatment
      of COVID-19.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health
      emergency of major international concern. Given the systemic immunosuppressive
      state caused by malignancy and anticancer treatments, patients with advanced lung
      cancer may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. During epidemic of
      COVID-19, a guideline for the optimal management of patients with advanced lung
      cancer urgently needs to be proposed to distinguish the symptoms of COVID-19 and 
      the side effects of antitumor drugs. This network questionnaire survey was
      conducted on the lung cancer group of the Chinese Thoracic Society, Chinese
      Medical Association; the lung cancer group of the Chinese Society of Clinical
      Oncology Youth Committee; and the Chinese Respiratory Oncology Collaboration. 321
      valid questionnaires were received. Based on the guidelines on lung cancer and
      the results of the questionnaires, a consensus was reached. During the epidemic
      of COVID-19, We recommended that patients with advanced NSCLC should be treated
      as outpatients as possible at the nearest medical center; Patients who need to be
      hospitalized for antitumor treatment should be excluded from COVID-19 infection; 
      More intensive attention should be paid to identification of COVID-19-related
      symptoms and adverse reactions caused by the malignancy or antitumor treatments. 
      Stronger personal protection should be made for advanced NSCLC patients; An
      intentional postponing of antitumor treatment should be considered according to
      patient performance status. Treatment strategies should be made according to
      different types of advanced NSCLC patients and efficacy and toxicity of drugs.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the imaging findings of 2019 novel coronavirus
      pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods: From January 20 to February 5, 2020, a total of
      130 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from seven hospitals in China were
      collected. The imaging data were reviewed and analyzed in detail. Results: (1)
      Distribution: the lesion detected in the lung unilaterally in 14 cases (10.7%)
      and bilaterally in 116 cases (89.3%). According to the distribution in the lobes 
      of the lung, all cases could be classified into subpleural distribution (102
      cases, 78.4%), centrilobular distribution (99 cases, 76.1%) and diffused
      distribution (8 cases, 6.1%). (2) Number of lesions: single lesion 9 cases
      (6.9%); multiple lesions 113 cases (86.9%), diffuse lesions 8 cases (6.1%). (3)
      Imaging density: 70 cases (53.8%) of ground-glass opacity (GGO), 60 cases (46.2%)
      of GGO + consolidation. (4) Accompanying signs: 100 cases (76.9%) with vascular
      thickening, 98 cases (75.3%) with "pleural parallel sign" ; "intralobular septal 
      thickening" in 100 cases (76.9%); "halo sign" in 13 cases (10%); "reversed-halo
      sign" in 6 cases (4.6%); pleural effusion in 3 cases (2.3 %), and pneumatocele in
      2 cases (1.5%); no case with pulmonary cavity. Among 35 patients that underwent
      follow-up CT, 21 patients (60%) improved while 14 (40%) exacerbated. Conclusions:
      COVID-19 imaging characteristic mainly has subpleural, centrilobular and diffused
      distribution. The first two distributions can overlap or progress to diffused
      distribution. In the later period, it was mainly manifested as organizing
      pneumonia and fibrosis. The most valuable characteristic is the pleural parallel 
      sign.

AB  - In order to achieve the overall victory of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease
      epidemic in this 'war', especially to prevent the disease recurrence from
      rebounding during the resumption of labor, the government has not loosened any
      control of personnel mobility, which has obviously affected the normal
      examination and treatment of lung cancer patients under the influence of this
      epidemic. During the epidemic period, cancer patients with low immunity levels
      face the double ordeals of disease and epidemic situation. Compared with the
      general population, they are more likely to be infected with the new coronavirus.
      Among the infected cancer patients, lung cancer is the most common type. It is
      necessary to provide more appropriate individualized treatment recommendations
      for patients with lung cancer based on the epidemic situation of the patient's
      location and in combination with the patient's own condition. Through active
      prevention of infection, timely conversion of treatment strategies, online and
      offline joint control, and positive psychological counseling, we significantly
      hope to help patients with lung cancer to survive this difficult period.

AB  - In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP, officially named
      Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) by the World Health Organization) broke out in
      Wuhan, Hubei, and it quickly spread to the whole country and abroad. The
      situation was at stake. The sudden and serious COVID-19 epidemic has brought us a
      lot of urgent problems. How to effectively control the spread of COVID-19? When
      does the population infection rate rise to its peak? What will eventually be the 
      number of infected patients? How to make early diagnosis? What effective
      antiviral drugs are available? How to effectively treat with existing drugs? Can 
      it successfully improve the survival rate of critically patients? In response to 
      the above questions, we put forward corresponding suggestions and reflections
      from the perspective of the infectious clinician.

AB  - There is an obvious concern globally regarding the fact about the emerging
      coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a worldwide public health
      threat. As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly
      available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational
      awareness and intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China,
      caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the
      epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting 
      people all around the globe. In this study, we present an effort to compile and
      analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID-19 based on the several
      open datasets on 2019-nCoV provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health
      Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health 
      Commission, and DXY. An exploratory data analysis with visualizations has been
      made to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, and 
      recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China. Overall, at the 
      outset of an outbreak like this, it is highly important to readily provide
      information to begin the evaluation necessary to understand the risks and begin
      containment activities.

TI  - Stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology during the novel
      coronavirus outbreak: an experience from Hong Kong.
LID - 10.1007/s00417-020-04641-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly emerged as a global health
      threat. The purpose of this article is to share our local experience of stepping 
      up infection control measures in ophthalmology to minimise COVID-19 infection of 
      both healthcare workers and patients. METHODS: Infection control measures
      implemented in our ophthalmology clinic are discussed. The measures are based on 
      detailed risk assessment by both local ophthalmologists and infection control
      experts. RESULTS: A three-level hierarchy of control measures was adopted. First,
      for administrative control, in order to lower patient attendance, text messages
      with an enquiry phone number were sent to patients to reschedule appointments or 
      arrange drug refill. In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage
      system was set up to identify patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute
      conjunctivitis or recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these
      individuals to postpone their appointments for at least 14 days. Micro-aerosol
      generating procedures, such as non-contact tonometry and operations under general
      anaesthesia were avoided. Nasal endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing 
      and cause generation of droplets. All elective clinical services were suspended. 
      Infection control training was provided to all clinical staff. Second, for
      environmental control, to reduce droplet transmission of COVID-19, installation
      of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent disinfection of equipment, and
      provision of eye protection to staff were implemented. All staff were advised to 
      measure their own body temperatures before work and promptly report any symptoms 
      of upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting or diarrhoea. Third, universal
      masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
      were promoted. CONCLUSION: We hope our initial experience in stepping up
      infection control measures for COVID-19 infection in ophthalmology can help
      ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential community outbreak or
      pandemic. In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, ophthalmologists should 
      work closely with local infection control teams to implement infection control
      measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.

TI  - Backcalculating the Incidence of Infection with COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess.

AB  - To understand the time-dependent risk of infection on a cruise ship, the Diamond 
      Princess, I estimated the incidence of infection with novel coronavirus
      (COVID-19). The epidemic curve of a total of 199 confirmed cases was drawn,
      classifying individuals into passengers with and without close contact and crew
      members. A backcalculation method was employed to estimate the incidence of
      infection. The peak time of infection was seen for the time period from 2 to 4
      February 2020, and the incidence has abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated 
      number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small
      from 5 February on which a movement restriction policy was imposed. Without the
      intervention from 5 February, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with
      and without close contact would have been as large as 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176)
      and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively, while these were kept to be 102
      and 47 cases, respectively. Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board, 
      the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be
      very limited. Movement restriction greatly reduced the number of infections from 
      5 February onwards.

AB  - Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the new
      coronavirus 2019-nCoV patients combined with cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 112 COVID-19 patients with CVD
      admitted to the western district of Union Hospital in Wuhan, from January 20,
      2020 to February 15, 2020. They were divided into critical group (ICU, n=16) and 
      general group (n=96) according to the severity of the disease and patients were
      followed up to the clinical endpoint. The observation indicators included total
      blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial blood gas analysis, myocardial
      injury markers, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolyte,
      procalcitonin (PCT), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood lipid, pulmonary CT 
      and pathogen detection. Results: Compared with the general group, the lymphocyte 
      count (0.74x10(9) (0.34x10(9), 0.94x10(9))/L vs. 0.99x10(9) (0.71x10(9),
      1.29x10(9))/L, P=0.03) was extremely lower in the critical group, CRP (106.98
      (81.57, 135.76) mg/L vs. 34.34 (9.55,76.54) mg/L, P<0.001) and PCT (0.20
      (0.15,0.48) mug/L vs. 0.11 (0.06,0.20)mug/L, P<0.001) were significantly higher
      in the critical group. The BMI of the critical group was significantly higher
      than that of the general group (25.5 (23.0, 27.5) kg/m(2) vs. 22.0 (20.0, 24.0)
      kg/m(2), P=0.003). Patients were further divided into non-survivor group (17,
      15.18%) group and survivor group (95, 84.82%). Among the non-survivors, there
      were 88.24% (15/17) patients with BMI> 25 kg/m(2), which was significantly higher
      than that of survivors (18.95% (18/95), P<0.001). Compared with the survived
      patients, oxygenation index (130 (102, 415) vs. 434 (410, 444), P<0.001) was
      significantly lower and lactic acid (1.70 (1.30, 3.00) mmol/L vs. 1.20 (1.10,
      1.60) mmol/L, P<0.001) was significantly higher in the non-survivors. There was
      no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between the
      critical group and the general group or between non-survivors and survivors (all 
      P>0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients combined with CVD are associated with a
      higher risk of mortality. Critical patients are characterized with lower
      lymphocyte counts. Higher BMI are more often seen in critical patients and
      non-survivor. ACEI/ARB use does not affect the morbidity and mortality of
      COVID-19 combined with CVD. Aggravating causes of death include fulminant
      inflammation, lactic acid accumulation and thrombotic events.

AB  - AIMS: A newly emerged Human Coronavirus (HCoV) is reported two months ago in
      Wuhan, China (COVID-19). Until today >2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases
      reported mainly in China and 40 other countries. Human to human transmission is
      confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago. Based on the World Health
      Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for >8000 cases with
      confirmed 774 deaths. Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out
      of about 2500 reported cases. The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs
      against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In
      this study, sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to build a model
      for Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp. Additionally, the newly emerged Wuhan HCoV RdRp model is
      targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and
      Ribavirin. KEY FINDINGS: The results suggest the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir,
      IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir as potent drugs against the newly emerged HCoV
      disease. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study presents a perfect model for COVID-19
      RdRp enabling its testing in silico against anti-polymerase drugs. Besides, the
      study presents some drugs that previously proved its efficiency against the newly
      emerged viral infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks
      of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics
      of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess
      if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from
      imported cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We developed a stochastic transmission
      model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the 
      potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling 
      a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We 
      considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic
      reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the
      probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that
      occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We
      assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were
      deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in
      total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and
      contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to
      measure feasibility of public health effort. FINDINGS: Simulated outbreaks
      starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1.5, and 0% transmission before
      symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability;
      however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of 
      initial cases, when R0 was 2.5 or 3.5 and with more transmission before symptom
      onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with 
      an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully
      traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2.5 more than 70% of
      contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3.5 more than 90% of contacts had to 
      be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in 
      determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1.5. For R0 values
      of 2.5 or 3.5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were
      only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before
      symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: In most scenarios, highly effective contact
      tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within
      3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom
      onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing
      transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated
      transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to
      assess the potential success of local response efforts. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust,

TI  - Distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic and correlation with population emigration 
      from wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000782 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ongoing new coronavirus pneumonia (Corona Virus Disease 2019,
      COVID-19) outbreak is spreading in China, but it has not yet reached its peak.
      Five million people emigrated from Wuhan before lockdown, potentially
      representing a source of virus infection. Determining case distribution and its
      correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early stage of the
      epidemic is of great importance for early warning and for the prevention of
      future outbreaks. METHODS: The official case report on the COVID-19 epidemic was 
      collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information on COVID-19 cases
      was extracted and analyzed using ArcGIS and WinBUGS software. Data on population 
      migration from Wuhan city and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi,
      and their correlation with the number of cases was analyzed. RESULTS: The
      COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in Hubei province accounted for 59.91%
      (5806/9692) and 95.77% (204/213) of the total cases in China respectively. Hot
      spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan, which are adjacent to Hubei. The time
      risk of Hubei province on the following day was 1.960 times that on the previous 
      day. The number of cases in some cities was relatively low, but the time risk
      appeared to be continuously rising. The correlation coefficient between the
      provincial number of cases and emigration from Wuhan was up to 0.943. The
      lockdown of 17 cities in Hubei province and the implementation of nationwide
      control measures efficiently prevented an exponential growth in the number of
      cases. CONCLUSIONS: The population that emigrated from Wuhan was the main
      infection source in other cities and provinces. Some cities with a low number of 
      cases showed a rapid increase in case load. Owing to the upcoming Spring Festival
      return wave, understanding the risk trends in different regions is crucial to
      ensure preparedness at both the individual and organization levels and to prevent
      new outbreaks.

TI  - Analysis of factors associated with disease outcomes in hospitalized patients
      with 2019 novel coronavirus disease.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000775 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This 
      study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in
      COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and 
      to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients 
      tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in
      this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between
      December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices,
      imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical
      analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were
      divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group.
      Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or
      Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test
      or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the
      risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with
      COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this
      study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11
      patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had
      improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly
      older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 
      37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a
      significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the
      improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, chi = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all
      the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body 
      temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than
      in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]
      degrees C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with
      respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, chi = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory
      rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were
      significantly higher in the progression group than in the
      improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in
      the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9
      [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was
      significantly lower in the progression group than in the
      improvement/stabilization group (36.62 +/- 6.60 vs. 41.27 +/- 4.55 g/L, U =
      2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive 
      high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (chi =
      16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio 
      [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; P = 0.011), history of
      smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature
      at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure
      (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI:
      1.098-50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI:
      1.224-34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were
      identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature on
      admission, respiratory failure, albumin, C-reactive protein. These results can be
      used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease
      rehabilitation patients.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000774 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in
      different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. The persistence and clearance of 
      viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and
      factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples
      from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management
      of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test 
      results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 
      20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients'
      oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. 
      Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory
      symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR 
      results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of
      differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and
      glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: 
      In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were
      included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a
      median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, 
      patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The
      median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for
      oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. By February
      10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA
      from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for
      2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom
      onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens
      were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0
      (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for
      viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three
      patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple
      linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the
      analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of
      viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of 
      viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the
      glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid
      treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and
      the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid
      treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group
      (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no
      statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients 
      with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P >
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools
      was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify 
      viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of
      viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not
      recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The
      duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.

AB  - With the increasing number of cases and widening geographical spread, the 2019
      novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been classified as one of the class B
      infectious diseases but prevented and controlled as class A infectious disease by
      the National Health Commission of China. The diagnosis and treatment of lung
      cancer patients have been challenged greatly because of extraordinary public
      health measures since the lung cancer patients are a high-risk population during 
      the COVID-19 outbreak period. Strict protection for lung cancer patients is
      needed to avoid infection. Lung cancer patients are difficult to differentiate
      from patients with COVID-19 in terms of clinical symptoms, which will bring great
      trouble to the clinical work and physical and mental health of lung cancer
      patients. This review will demonstrate how to applicate appropriate and
      individual management for lung cancer patients to protect them from COVID-19.

AB  - With a large number of COVID-19 patients discharging from hospital, some had
      showed re-fever and positive nucleic acid test after discharge from hospital.
      This might be due to the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, and might also 
      be related to the basic disease, clinical status, glucocorticoid using, sample
      sampling, processing and detecting of patients, and some even related to the
      re-infection or secondary bacterial virus infection. Therefore, we suggest that
      in view of this phenomenon, further stratified management of discharge from
      hospital should be carried out on the basis of guidelines, especially for
      patients with advanced age, underlying diseases or severe or critical pneumonia. 
      For those patients who can't completely deoxygenate for a long time after
      hospitalization, individualized treatment methods and different discharge
      evaluation criteria should be adopted to ensure the complete cure of patients and
      prevent recurrencing after discharge from hospital.

AB  - Objective: To study the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan
      Province. Methods: An epidemiological study was conducted based on the latest
      epidemic information of 1,265 confirmed cases (including regional distribution,
      severe illness, and deaths) announced by Health Commission of Henan Province, as 
      well as the details of 1,079 COVID-19 officially released by Health Commission of
      municipalities in Henan Province collected as of 24:00 on February 19, 2020.
      Results: Among 1 079 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, there were 573 male
      (53.2%) and 505 female (46.8%) , with the ratio of male to female of 1.14:1; The 
      majority of patients were 36-59 years old (553 cases, 51.3%) , and the mean age
      was 46 (interquartile range is 24) years old; 515 cases (47.7%) had a history of 
      living, traveling, doing business in Wuhan or a brief stopover at Wuhan train
      stop, and 382 (35.4%) had a history of close contact with confirmed patients;
      There were 72 severe cases (5.7%) in 1 265 patients, and the fatality rate was
      1.5%. A high number of cases were reported in Xinyang (269 cases, 21.26%) ,
      Zhengzhou (156 cases, 12.33%) , Nanyang (155 cases, 12.25%) , Zhumadian (139
      cases, 10.99%) , followed by Shangqiu (91 cases, 7.19%) , Zhoukou (76 cases,

      debilitation (44 cases, 7.3%) , cough (110 cases, 18.2%) , expectoration (19
      cases, 3.1%) , chills (6 cases, 1.0%) , shiver (7 cases, 1.2%) , running nose (21
      cases, 3.5%) , stuffy noses (8 cases, 1.3%) , throat dryness and sore (24 cases, 
      4.0%) , headache (21 cases, 3.5%) , chest pain (6 cases, 1.0%) , anhelation (18
      cases, 3.0%) , and gastrointestinal symptom (21 cases, 3.5%) . The age of deaths 
      ranged from 33 to 86 years old, with an average age of 72 (interquartile range of
      17) years old; there be 7 males (63.6%) and 4 females (36.4%) . Conclusion: The
      cases in Henan Province were mainly imported cases and had certain geographical
      location relevance; meanwhile, there was a family-focused incidence. The overall 
      trend of new cases was wave-like decline, and the number of deaths was high among
      elderly men with underlying diseases.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations,
      treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019 novel
      coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection in children from six provinces (autonomous
      region) in northern China. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the
      epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest
      imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was
      conducted. The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February
      21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces(autonomous region) of
      Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31
      children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years).
      Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with
      confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees 
      from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases.
      The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases
      (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed. The
      most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9
      cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9
      days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for </=3 d, while in other 5 cases lasted
      > 3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) and diarrhea
      (n=3, 9%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. 
      In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2
      cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet
      count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30),
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate(19%,4/21), procalcitonin(4%,1/28), liver
      enzyme(22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different
      proportions. Renal function and blood glucose were normal. There were abnormal
      chest CT changes in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass
      opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the
      pleural area. After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned
      negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered
      and were discharged from hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case
      series, 2019-nCoV infections in children from six provinces (autonomous region)
      in northern China are mainly caused by close family contact. Clinical types are
      asymptomatic, mild and common types. Clinical manifestations and laboratory
      examination results are nonspecific. Close contact history of epidemiology,
      nucleic acid detection and chest imaging are important bases for diagnosis. After
      general treatment, the short-term prognosis is good.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential 
      respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused
      on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak
      could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.
      While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy
      to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help
      these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential
      options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for
      speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. 
      I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal
      antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome,
      emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for
      the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any 
      mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that
      blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain,
      providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, 
      while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The
      sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its
      possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug
      today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are
      later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a
      protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to
      year(s).

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause china
      epidemics with high morbidity and mortality, the infection has been transmitted
      to other countries. About three neonates and more than 230 children cases are
      reported. The disease condition of the main children was mild. There is currently
      no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to
      the newborn. The treatment strategy for children with Coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) is based on adult experience. Thus far, no deaths have been reported
      in the pediatric age group. This review describes the current understanding of
      COVID-19 infection in newborns and children.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics and placental pathology of
      2019-nCoV infection in pregnancy, and to evaluate intrauterine vertical
      transmission potential of 2019-nCoV infection. Methods: The placentas delivered
      from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection which were received in the
      Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong
      University of Science and Technology collected by February 4th, 2020 and
      retrospectively studied. Their clinical material including placental tissue and
      lung CT, and laboratory results were collected, meanwhile, nucleic acid detection
      of 2019-nCoV of the placentas were performed by RT-PCR. Results: Three placentas 
      delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, who were all in
      their third trimester with emergency caesarean section. All of the three patients
      presented with fever (one before caesarean and two in postpartum), and had no
      significant leukopenia and lymphopenia. Neonatal throat swabs from three newborns
      were tested for 2019-nCoV, and all samples were negative for the nucleic acid of 
      2019-nCoV. One premature infant was transferred to Department of Neonatology due 
      to low birth weight. By the end of February 25, 2020, none of the three patients 
      developed severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia or died(two patients had been cured and
      discharged, while another one had been transferred to a square cabin hospital for
      isolation treatment). There were various degrees of fibrin deposition inside and 
      around the villi with local syncytial nodule increases in all three placentas.
      One case of placenta showed the concomitant morphology of chorionic hemangioma
      and another one with massive placental infarction. No pathological change of
      villitis and chorioamnionitis was observed in our observation of three cases. All
      samples from three placentas were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV.
      Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with 2019-nCoV
      infection in late pregnancy are similar to those of non-pregnant patients, and no
      severe adverse pregnancy outcome is found in the 3 cases of our observation.
      Pathological study suggests that there are no morphological changes related to
      infection in the three placentas. Currently no evidence for intrauterine vertical
      transmission of 2019-nCoV is found in the three women infected by 2019-nCoV in
      their late pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical
      herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also
      contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),
      an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia. METHODS: There were two main 
      steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature
      search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against
      sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the
      Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting
      both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and
      excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be
      effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the
      potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we
      searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected
      compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen 
      were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally,
      network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of 
      each selected herb. RESULTS: Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in 
      traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV
      activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 
      compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral
      respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general 
      in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral
      infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. CONCLUSION:
      Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory
      infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.

AB  - An outbreak of respiratory illness proved to be infected by a 2019 novel
      coronavirus, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was notified
      first in Wuhan, China, and has spread rapidly in China and to other parts of the 
      world. Herein, we reported the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus
      pneumonia (NCP) imported from China in Taiwan. This case report revealed a
      natural course of NCP with self-recovery, which may be a good example in
      comparison with medical treatments.

LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200216-00106 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Fitting and forecasting the trend of COVID-19 epidemics. Methods:
      Based on SEIR dynamic model, considering the COVID-19 transmission mechanism,
      infection spectrum and prevention and control procedures, we developed SEIR(+
      CAQ) dynamic model to fit the frequencies of laboratory confirmed cases obtained 
      from the government official websites. The data from January 20, 2020 to February
      7, 2020 were used to fit the model, while the left data between February 8-12
      were used to evaluate the quality of forecasting. Results: According to the
      cumulative number of confirmed cases between January 29 to February 7, the
      fitting bias of SEIR(+ CAQ) model for overall China (except for cases of Hubei
      province), Hubei province (except for cases of Wuhan city) and Wuhan city was
      less than 5%. For the data of subsequent 5 days between February 8 to 12, which
      were not included in the model fitting, the prediction biases were less than 10%.
      Regardless of the cases diagnosed by clinical examines, the numbers of daily
      emerging cases of China (Hubei province not included), Hubei Province (Wuhan city
      not included) and Wuhan city reached the peak in the early February. Under the
      current strength of prevention and control, the total number of laboratory-
      confirmed cases in overall China will reach 80 417 till February 29, 2020,
      respectively. Conclusions: The proposed SEIR(+ CAQ) dynamic model fits and
      forecasts the trend of novel coronavirus pneumonia well and provides evidence for
      decision making.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the current status of the prevention and control of
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China, establish a predictive model to
      evaluate the effects of the current prevention and control strategies, and
      provide scientific information for decision- making departments. Methods: Based
      on the epidemic data of COVID-19 openly accessed from national health
      authorities, we estimated the dynamic basic reproduction number R(0)(t) to
      evaluate the effects of the current COVID-19 prevention and control strategies in
      all the provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) as well as in Wuhan and
      the changes in infectivity of COVID-19 over time. Results: For the stability of
      the results, 24 provinces (municipality) with more than 100 confirmed COVID-19
      cases were included in the analysis. At the beginning of the outbreak, the
      R(0)(t) showed unstable trend with big variances. As the strengthening of the
      prevention and control strategies, R(0)(t) began to show a downward trend in late
      January, and became stable in February. By the time of data analysis, 18
      provinces (municipality) (75%) had the R(0)(t)s less than 1. The results could be
      used for the decision making to free population floating conditionally.
      Conclusions: Dynamic R(0)(t) is useful in the evaluation of the change in
      infectivity of COVID-19, the prevention and control strategies for the COVID-19
      outbreak have shown preliminary effects, if continues, it is expected to control 
      the COVID-19 outbreak in China in near future.

AB  - Objective: To study the early dynamics of the epidemic of coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) in China from 15 to 31 January, 2020, and estimate the corresponding
      epidemiological parameters (incubation period, generation interval and basic
      reproduction number) of the epidemic. Methods: By means of Weibull, Gamma and
      Lognormal distributions methods, we estimated the probability distribution of the
      incubation period and generation interval data obtained from the reported
      COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the AIC criterion was used to determine the optimal
      distribution. Considering the epidemic is ongoing, the exponential growth model
      was used to fit the incidence data of COVID-19 from 10 to 31 January, 2020, and
      exponential growth method, maximum likelihood method and SEIR model were used to 
      estimate the basic reproduction number. Results: Early COVID-19 cases kept an
      increase in exponential growth manner before 26 January, 2020, then the increase 
      trend became slower. The average incubation period was 5.01 (95%CI: 4.31-5.69)
      days; the average generation interval was 6.03 (95%CI: 5.20-6.91) days. The basic
      reproduction number was estimated to be 3.74 (95%CI: 3.63-3.87), 3.16 (95%CI:
      2.90-3.43), and 3.91 (95%CI: 3.71-4.11) by three methods, respectively.
      Conclusions: The Gamma distribution fits both the generation interval and
      incubation period best, and the mean value of generation interval is 1.02 day
      longer than that of incubation period. The relatively high basic reproduction
      number indicates that the epidemic is still serious; Based on our analysis, the
      turning point of the epidemic would be seen on 26 January, the growth rate would 
      be lower afterwards.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection
      pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the
      COVID-19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to
      determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in
      Beijing. METHODS: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency
      Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic,
      epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic
      classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared
      the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including
      mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the
      features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. FINDINGS: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients 
      were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals
      for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical
      service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were
      common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia
      cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients
      was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of
      Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact
      with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms
      at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%),
      dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days,
      the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As
      of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital
      in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%.
      INTERPRETATION: On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19
      infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases
      in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low
      fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early 
      stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early
      isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and
      communities in Beijing. FUNDING: Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about COVID-19 outside Hubei. The aim of this paper
      was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of
      hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang,
      China. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive
      patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in 
      three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th,
      2020. FINDINGS: A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while 
      another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure
      history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms,
      14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had
      lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein. On chest computed tomography
      (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments
      presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented
      consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy
      form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei 
      exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had 
      negative findings even10 days later. INTERPRETATION: Most patients presented with
      a mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral
      ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly
      suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset. Nevetheless, some
      patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for
      COVID-19. FUNDING: We did not receive any fundings.

AB  - Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019, the diagnosis
      and treatment of patients with cancer have been facing great challenges. Although
      oncologists are not fighting on the front line to against the epidemic, during
      this special period, we should not only protect patients, their families and
      medical staff from the infection of novel Coronavirus, but also minimize the
      impact of the epidemic on the diagnosis and the treatment of patients with
      cancer. Combining the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of tumors with our
      clinical experience, in this epidemic period, we discuss the strategies for
      diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of malignant tumors of the digestive system
      in this article.

TI  - A mathematical model for simulating the phase-based transmissibility of a novel
      coronavirus.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown
      etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee 
      on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a
      mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. METHODS: In
      this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model
      for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be 
      bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to 
      explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan
      Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as
      Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix
      approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) from the RP 
      model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The value of R0 
      was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person
      which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from
      introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population
      was 3.58. CONCLUSIONS: Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2
      was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East
      countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in
      the Republic of Korea.

AB  - 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is one of the beta coronaviruses and was
      identified as the pathogen of the severe "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)" in
      2019. China has formally included the 2019-nCoV in the statutory notification and
      control system for infectious diseases according to the Law of the People's
      Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases.
      Currently, the national defending actions on the 2019-nCoV in China is in a
      critical period. Burn Department is also confronted with risk of infection by the
      2019-nCoV. According to the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19
      (6(th) trial edition), the latest relative literature at home and abroad, the
      features of the COVID-19, recommendations for the COVID-19 prevention and control
      issued by the National Health Commission of China, and management experience of
      diagnosis and treatment in the related disciplines, we put forward
      recommendations for the medical practices of burn treatment during the outbreak
      of the COVID-19 in outpatient and emergency treatment, inpatient treatment,
      operation and ward management, etc. We hope these recommendations could benefit
      the professionals of the same occupation as us and related hospital managers,
      improve the treatment of burn during the outbreak of the COVID-19, and avoid or
      reduce the risk of infection of medical staff .

AB  - The treatment of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) 
      faces compelling challenges. In this issue, we'd like to share our first-line
      treatment experience in treating COVID-19. Hemodynamics need be closely monitored
      and different types of shock should be distinguished. Vasoconstrictor drugs
      should be used rationally and alerting of complications is of the same
      importance. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) needs to be assessed, and
      effective prevention should be carried out for high-risk patients. It is
      necessary to consider the possibility of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in
      patients with sudden onset of oxygenation deterioration, respiratory distress,
      reduced blood pressure. However, comprehensive analysis of disease state should
      be taken into the interpretation of abnormally elevated D-Dimer. Nutritional
      support is the basis of treatment. It's important to establish individual therapy
      regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically. Under the current
      epidemic situation, convalescent plasma can only be used empirically, indications
      need to be strictly screened, the blood transfusion process should be closely
      monitored and the curative effect should be dynamically evaluated.

TI  - Potential Rapid Diagnostics, Vaccine and Therapeutics for 2019 Novel Coronavirus 
      (2019-nCoV): A Systematic Review.
LID - E623 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9030623 [doi]
AB  - Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the 
      management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to
      systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for
      Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their
      prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was
      carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane
      Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary
      strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total
      of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for
      confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit
      developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and 
      likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits
      have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine
      candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a
      synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as
      therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy
      against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV 
      and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against
      2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug 
      combinations supported by high-level evidence.

AB  - A novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV, hit the central Chinese city of
      Wuhan in late December 2019, and subsequently spread rapidly to all provinces of 
      China and multiple countries. As of 0:00 am February 9, 2020, a total of 37,287
      cases have been confirmed infection of 2019-nCoV in China mainland, and 302 cases
      have also been cumulatively reported from 24 countries. According to the latest
      data, a total of 813 deaths occurred in China mainland, with the mortality
      reaching approximately 2.2%. At present, there is no vaccine or specific drugs
      for the human coronavirus. Therefore, it is critical to understand the nature of 
      the virus and its clinical characteristics, in order to respond to the 2019-nCoV 
      outbreak. Thus, the present study briefly but comprehensively summarizes the not 
      much but timely reports on the 2019-nCoV.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed
      tomography (CT) in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging
      findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning 
      and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed.
      RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28,
      severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years)
      were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe
      (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also
      significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild
      patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1 degrees C), 49 (98%) patients had
      normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of
      lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild
      patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion 
      was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower
      lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was
      primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension
      towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and
      asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass
      opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and
      fibrosis. CONCLUSION: CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground
      glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial
      consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if
      improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment 
      of NCP.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of Imported Cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province: A
      Multicenter Descriptive Study.
LID - ciaa199 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of imported
      coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Jiangsu Province. METHODS: We
      retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory
      characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three
      Grade A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was
      used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. RESULTS: Of the 80
      patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of
      46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited
      mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic
      acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical
      manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases
      (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed
      liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed
      abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of
      both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient
      died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. CONCLUSIONS:
      Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate
      symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having
      liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of
      Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two
      consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.

TI  - COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: estimating the epidemic
      potential and effectiveness of public health countermeasures.
LID - taaa030 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jtm/taaa030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces with
      relative homogeneous mixing. On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on
      cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an
      index case on board around 21-25 January. By 4 February, public health measures
      such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill
      passengers were implemented. By 20 February, 619 of 3,700 passengers and crew
      (17%) were tested positive. METHODS: We estimated the basic reproduction number
      from the initial period of the outbreak using (SEIR) models. We calibrated the
      models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We
      additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures,
      and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of
      differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an
      earlier versus later evacuation of the ship. RESULTS: The basic reproduction rate
      was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the ${R}_0$ in the epicentre in
      Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled
      initial ${R}_0$ of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the
      time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have
      been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and
      lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers
      on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their
      incubation time. CONCLUSIONS: The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an
      already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more
      than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions. However, evacuating all 
      passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more
      passengers and crew from infection.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China.
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2002032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged
      in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the
      clinical characteristics of the affected patients. METHODS: We extracted data
      regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 
      30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29,
      2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit
      (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: The median age of
      the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary
      composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were
      admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4%
      who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with
      wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan,
      including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever
      (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea
      was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile
      range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic
      finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT
      abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and
      in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in
      83.2% of the patients on admission. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 2 months of the
      current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying
      degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have
      abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China 
      and others.).

AB  - From December 2019, the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, 
      Hubei, and spread rapidly to the nationwide. On January 20, 2020, the National
      Health Committee classified COVID-19 pneumonia as one of B class infectious
      diseases and treated it as class A infectious disease. During the epidemic
      period, the routine diagnosis and treatment of tumor patients was affected with
      varying degrees. In this special period, we performed the superiority of the
      multi-disciplinary team of diagnosis and treatment, achieved accurate diagnosis
      and treatment of patients with hepatobiliary malignant tumors, provided support
      for these patients with limited medical resources, and helped them to survive
      during the epidemic period.On the basis of fully understanding the new
      coronavirus pneumonia, the treatment strategy should be changed timely during the
      epidemic, and more appropriate treatment methods should be adopted to minimize
      the adverse effect of the epidemic on tumor treatment.

AB  - Prevention and control about the situation of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
      are grim at present. In addition to supporting the frontline actively, medical
      workers in general surgery spare no efforts in making good diagnosis and
      treatment of specialized diseases by optimizing treatment process, providing
      medical advice online, mastering indications of delayed operation and emergency
      operation reasonably, etc. Budd-Chiari syndrome is a complex disorder, and
      severity of the disease varies, serious cases can be life threatening. While
      fighting the epidemic, medical workers should also ensure the medical needs of
      patients. However, instead of continuing the traditional treatment, a new
      management system should be developed. Based on the characteristics of
      Budd-Chiari syndrome patients in China and our experience, we divide the patients
      into ordinary and critical cases, and treatment strategies suitable for the
      epidemic period of COVID-19 are put forward for reference and discussion by
      physicians.

AB  - So far, there is a lack of effective drugs for the new coronavirus pneumonia.
      With more and more patients diagnosed, China has carried out more than 100
      clinical studies of new coronavirus infection, including antiviral drugs,
      antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, virus vaccine, and other
      Western drugs, while Chinese medicine research accounted for half of the studies.
      Most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period would
      last for 1 to 11 months. The primary endpoints included symptom improvement and
      virus nucleic acid turning negative, but the optimal endpoint has not been
      determined. Although the final results of studies will take a long time to
      complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent 
      demand for drug treatment. Compared with that of during SARS period in 2003,
      China has the stronger capability to carry out clinical trials of new drugs in
      emergency period.

      single arm meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25735 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to summarize reliable evidence of evidence-based medicine for
      the treatment and prevention of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical
      characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library,
      Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical
      characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected for meta-analysis.
      RESULTS: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 
      50466 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these
      patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence 
      of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness
      or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652). The incidence of acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of
      abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the
      percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127,
      0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was
      0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061). CONCLUSION: Fever and cough are the most common
      symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and most of these patients have
      abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as 
      well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other
      symptoms are rare. The case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection
      is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East
      Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This meta-analysis also has limitations, so the
      conclusions of this Meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant
      studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample
      size.

AB  - Objective: To explorethe proper protective measures for pancreaticdiseases
      treatment during theoutbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19). Method:
      Clinical data of four cases of patients that suffered COVID-19from February
      2(nd), 2020 to February 9(th), 2020 in pancreatic surgery were reviewed.After the
      first patientscuffednosocomial infection of COVID-19, the general protective
      measures in our department wereupdated.Only one patient was admitted to each room
      alone, with no more than one caregiver.The body temperature of care givers was
      measuredtwice a day.Primary protections were applied to all staff.The floor was
      sterilized using disinfectant with an effective chlorine concentration of 1000
      mg/L.The protective measures for interventional procedures were as follow.Primary
      protection was applied to the operators ofcentral venipuncture catheter,
      percutaneous abdominal/pleural drainage, percutaneous retroperitoneal drainage,
      percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage and other surgical procedures with 
      local anesthesiaand epidural anesthesia.Secondary protection was applied to the
      operators of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and surgical
      procedures with general anesthesia. Results: During Feb 2(nd), 2020 to Feb 9(th),
      2020, four patients in our department were diagnosed with COVID-19, of which one 
      was died of COVID-19, two were cured, and one is still in hospital for
      COVID-19.After the update ofprotective measures in our department, no more
      nosocomial infection of COVID-19occurred.Two central venipuncture catheter, three
      percutaneous abdominal/pleural drainage, one percutaneous retroperitoneal
      drainage, one percuteneous transhepatic cholecyst drainage and one open surgery
      with general anesthesia were performed with no infection of operators.
      Conclusions: The caregivers of patients are potential infection source of
      COVID-19.Enhanced protective measures including the management measures of
      caregivers can decrease the risk of nosocomial infection of COVID-19.

TI  - Imaging and clinical features of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also 
      called 2019-nCoV) recently break out in Wuhan, China, and was named as COVID-19. 
      With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other
      regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of 
      these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: All
      patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4,
      2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). This
      analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age
      range, 18-86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent
      non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical
      characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics,
      pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In
      addition, after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were
      evaluated to assess radiological evolution. FINDINGS: The majority of infected
      patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly
      presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented
      bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%)
      patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19
      pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 
      (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%),
      adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55
      (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon 
      findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21
      patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the 
      second CT after 3-4 days. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based
      on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and
      laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial
      diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass
      opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical
      chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new
      coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
      aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections
      with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health
      Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections-SARS in 2002-2003 and
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-both caused severe respiratory
      syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a
      global spread are caused by beta-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually
      infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is
      common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of
      coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and 
      more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations
      of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In
      this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of 
      SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10,
      2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.

AB  - The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a
      novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
      There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways
      to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine
      design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between
      SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging
      existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the
      experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the
      immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T 
      cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map
      identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these
      identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21
      February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer
      protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a
      population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of 
      epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in
      China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide
      experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, 
      and has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories,
      including the United States (1). As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936
      reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland
      China (1). There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been
      reported in the United States. Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United
      States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from
      high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States.
      This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local
      health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are
      implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United
      States. These measures require the identification of cases and contacts of
      persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment,
      monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19
      transmission. Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission
      of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the
      spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health
      departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the 
      general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better
      characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development 
      and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics,
      and vaccines. U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation
      closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO)
      and other global partners. Interim guidance is available at
      https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html. As more is learned about this novel
      virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance
      for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and
      communities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to describe
      the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.
      METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation
      sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who 
      underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were
      grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan:
      group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans
      done </=1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4
      (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and 
      compared across the four groups. FINDINGS: 81 patients admitted to hospital
      between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort
      included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49.5 years (SD
      11.0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10.5 (SD 6.4) overall, 2.8
      (3.3) in group 1, 11.1 (5.4) in group 2, 13.0 (5.7) in group 3, and 12.1 (5.9) in
      group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] 
      patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass
      opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of
      849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral
      (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]).
      Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass 
      opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of 
      ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3,
      and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became
      more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). INTERPRETATION:
      COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in
      asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse
      bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with
      consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with
      clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19
      pneumonia. FUNDING: None.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute
      respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan,
      China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is
      scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill
      patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: In this single-centered,
      retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients 
      with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of
      Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan
      26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities,
      treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between 
      survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 
      9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring
      mechanical ventilation. FINDINGS: Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52
      critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 
      59.7 (SD 13.3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%)
      had fever. 32 (61.5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from 
      admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days for
      non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64.6 years
      [11.2] vs 51.9 years [12.9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9
      [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%]
      patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients
      had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute
      kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and
      one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.
      Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13.5%) patients. INTERPRETATION:
      The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is
      considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2
      weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS
      are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great 
      strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not
      adequately staffed or resourced. FUNDING: None.

AB  - As the world is witnessing the epidemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel 
      coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerging genetics and clinical evidences suggest a
      similar path to those of SARS and MERS. The rapid genomic sequencing and open
      access data, together with advanced vaccine technology, are expected to give us
      more knowledge on the pathogen itself, including the host immune response as well
      as the plan for therapeutic vaccines in the near future. This review aims to
      provide a comparative view among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly epidemic
      SARS-CoV-2, in the hope to gain a better understanding of the host-pathogen
      interaction, host immune responses, and the pathogen immune evasion strategies.
      This predictive view may help in designing an immune intervention or preventive
      vaccine for COVID-19 in the near future.

AB  - Since December 2019, unexplained pneumonia has appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei
      Province, and a new type of coronavirus infection was confirmed as COVID-19.
      COVID-19 spread rapidly nationwide and abroad. The COVID-19 has brought huge
      impacts to all the people and walks of life, especially to the medical and health
      systems. It has also brought great challenges to the treatment of patients with
      cancer. Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor in China and most of the
      patients are in the middle and advanced stage when diagnosed, with
      immunosuppressive and poor prognosis. The selection of surgical procedures and
      perioperative managements of esophageal cancer require all thoracic surgeons work
      together to figure out a reasonable system of surgical treatment and emergency
      response.

PG  - 1-21
AB  - Prior to the global outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were
      the only coronaviruses known to infect humans. Following the SARS outbreak, 5
      additional coronaviruses have been discovered in humans, most recently the novel 
      coronavirus COVID-19, believed to have originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
      China. SARS-CoV and MERSCoV are particularly pathogenic in humans and are
      associated with high mortality. In this review, the epidemiology,
      pathophysiology, and management of the recently discovered COVID-19 are reviewed,
      with a focus on best practices and the public health implications.

TI  - Development and Clinical Application of A Rapid IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Test
      for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Diagnosis.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25727 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over 
      China and to more than 20 other countries. Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2)
      nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In
      addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an
      accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected
      patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure
      timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care 
      lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously
      against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect
      patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out
      clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection
      sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples
      collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8
      different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and
      specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results
      obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The
      results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick
      blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better
      utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used
      for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in
      hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. This article is protected by

LID - 10.1002/jmv.25728 [doi]
AB  - Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle
      East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic
      coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 
      2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares
      highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal
      pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to
      those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of
      patients with COVID-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted
      to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some
      patients with COVID-19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea,
      and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always
      confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central
      nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been
      reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the
      brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been
      demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary
      cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung
      and lower respiratory airways. Considering the high similarity between SARS-CoV
      and SARS-CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of
      SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients 
      with COVID-19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the
      prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.

AB  - In the past few decades, coronaviruses have risen as a global threat to public
      health. Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from Wuhan
      caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19.
      However, there are agents that were used during the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics. We could
      learn from SARS and MERS. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the
      protease activity of coronavirus. In this review, we discuss the literature on
      the efficacy of LPV in vitro and in vivo, especially in patients with SARS and
      MERS, so that we might clarify the potential for the use of LPV in patients with 
      COVID-19.

AB  - An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China since
      December 2019 has led to 31,516 infected persons and 638 deaths across 25
      countries (till 16:00 on February 7, 2020). The virus causing this pneumonia was 
      then named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health
      Organization. To promote the data sharing and make all relevant information of
      2019-nCoV publicly available, we construct the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource
      (2019nCoVR, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). 2019nCoVR features comprehensive
      integration of genomic and proteomic sequences as well as their metadata
      information from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, National
      Center for Biotechnology Information, China National GeneBank, National
      Microbiology Data Center and China National Center for Bioinformation
      (CNCB)/National Genomics Data Center (NGDC). It also incorporates a wide range of
      relevant information including scientific literatures, news, and popular articles
      for science dissemination, and provides visualization functionalities for genome 
      variation analysis results based on all collected 2019-nCoV strains. Moreover, by
      linking seamlessly with related databases in CNCB/NGDC, 2019nCoVR offers virus
      data submission and sharing services for raw sequence reads and assembled
      sequences. In this report, we provide comprehensive descriptions on data
      deposition, management, release and utility in 2019nCoVR, laying important
      foundations in aid of studies on virus classification and origin, genome
      variation and evolution, fast detection, drug development and pneumonia precision
      prevention and therapy.

TI  - Expert Recommendations for Tracheal Intubation in Critically ill Patients with
      Noval Coronavirus Disease 2019.
LID - 10.24920/003724 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), 
      is a highly contagious disease. It firstly appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province of
      China in December 2019. During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout
      China and spread to multiple countries through infected persons travelling by
      air. Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue
      and cough. But in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop to the 
      acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and
      coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact
      and natural aerosols from human-to-human. Therefore, high-risk aerosol-producing 
      procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high 
      risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists
      after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported 
      in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society
      of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we
      hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline
      anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management,
      enhanced droplet/airborne PPE should be applied to the health care providers. A
      good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For
      patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided and modified
      rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant
      should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good
      preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.

      in China: A Report of 1014 Cases.
PG  - 200642
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2020200642 [doi]
AB  - Background Chest CT is used for diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19), as an important complement to the reverse-transcription polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and
      consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. 
      Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who
      underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference 
      standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed.
      Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of
      RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was
      analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4
      days or more. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR
      results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest
      CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on
      positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) 
      had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely
      cases, with 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT
      scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR
      results was 5.1 +/- 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR 
      result was 6.9 +/- 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT
      consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR
      results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before 
      the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity
      for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the
      current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.

AB  - The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly.
      In order to prevent cluster outbreaks, the government strengthened the management
      and control of personnel mobility, which had a great impact on the examination
      and treatment of breast cancer patients. This paper discusses how to realize
      scientific health management of breast cancer patients outside the hospital based
      on the existing epidemic situation, characteristics of breast cancer patients and
      public health safety factors. The breast cancer patients should synthetically
      consider the epidemic prevention situation of inhabitance, the disease stage and 
      previous therapeutic schedule to decide the next therapeutic schedule. If
      necessary, after professional discussion and communication between doctors and
      patients online or offline, the hospital visiting time should be delayed through 
      seeking alternative treatment schemes, and psychological counseling for patients 
      should be paid attention to at the same time.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the presence of novel coronavirus in tears 
      and conjunctival secretions of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. METHODS: A
      prospective interventional case series study was performed, and 30 confirmed
      novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients were selected at the First Affiliated 
      Hospital of Zhejiang University from 26 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. At an
      interval of 2 to 3 days, tear and conjunctival secretions were collected twice
      with disposable sampling swabs for reverse-transcription polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-PCR) assay. RESULTS: Twenty-one common-type and nine severe-type NCP
      patients were enrolled. Two samples of tear and conjunctival secretions were
      obtained from the only one patient with conjunctivitis yielded positive RT-PCR
      results. Fifty-eight samples from other patents were all negative. CONCLUSION: We
      speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival
      secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis.

AB  - From December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia (formerly known
      as the 2019 novel Coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) broke out in Wuhan, China. In this
      study, we present serial CT findings in a 40-year-old female patient with
      COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with the symptoms of fever, chest tightness, and
      fatigue. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time
      reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. CT showed rapidly progressing
      peripheral consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs. After
      treatment, the lesions were shown to be almost absorbed leaving the fibrous
      lesions.

AB  - After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world
      in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause
      severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV
      isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the
      Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes
      acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as "coronavirus
      disease 2019" (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused
      widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are 
      some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features
      between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal
      of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and
      SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and 
      treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.

AB  - Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first identified
      in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. This virus is responsible for the ongoing 
      outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in
      humans. Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO
      declared coronavirus as a global health emergency. Nearly 35,000 cases were
      reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus
      cases as early on as February. Inter-human transmission was reported in a few
      countries, including the United States. Neither an effective anti-viral nor a
      vaccine is currently available to treat this infection. As the virus is a newly
      emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus's
      reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown. The
      collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about 
      this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment
      to combat this infection. Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that 
      plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a
      short time. In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for
      rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for
      biopharmaceutical development are discussed.

AB  - Currently, the epidemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still ongoing. 
      The characteristics including high contagiousness, herd susceptibility and
      clinical phenotype diversity, made a serious influence on people's daily life and
      rountine therapy for other diseases. Breast dieases are clinical common diseases.
      In the central epidemic area of COVID-19, Hubei province, especially Wuhan, the
      clinical specialists of breast diseases should consider all of the following
      factors comprehensively: the prevention of COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment 
      of breast diseases and the accessibility of medical resources. Besides, we should
      select the appropriate therapy and optimize treatment process so as to prevent
      the propagation and cross infection of COVID-19 as well as manage the breast
      diseases without delay. Therefore, we carried out some management proposals of
      the patients with breast diseases in the central epidemic area during the
      epidemic of COVID-19 on the basis of conventional treatment guidelines and
      clinical experiences. The suggestions and corrections from colleagues will be
      welcomed.

PG  - 0
AB  - The current epidemic situation of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) still
      remained severe. As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious
      Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine
      is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the
      present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National
      Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and
      established an effective treatment strategy centered on "Four-Anti and
      Two-Balance" for clinical practice. The "Four-Anti and Two-Balance"strategy
      included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and
      maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological
      balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was
      recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical
      detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was
      emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest
      positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10%
      patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR
      results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces,
      indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was
      necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial
      liver blood purification system. The "Four-Anti and
      Two-Balance"strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early 
      antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness
      progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed
      antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine
      storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove
      inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe
      balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy 
      in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of
      moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 
      mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen
      therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients
      with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster
      ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis 
      should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with 
      long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT),
      meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with
      COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as
      Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function
      should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of
      prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal
      microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial
      translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore,
      we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also
      integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation
      through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized
      nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained 
      unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, 
      two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular
      following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have
      been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19
      was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of
      prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the dynamic changes of chest CT images of patients with
      corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19). METHODS: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were
      admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of
      Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with
      an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The
      shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The
      shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of
      the lesions on the CT images were reviewed. RESULTS: The obvious shadows
      infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases
      there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination.
      Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%)
      had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air
      bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened
      leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During
      hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare, the
      fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging
      manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days
      after admission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in
      40 cases (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have
      certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring
      disease progress and clinical treatment.

AB  - Antiviral drugs for managing infections with human coronaviruses are not yet
      approved, posing a serious challenge to current global efforts aimed at
      containing the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad
      spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor
      of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV
      nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a
      part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. 
      We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The
      triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart
      ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state 
      approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other
      nucleotide analogues. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA
      synthesis arrest at position i+3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is
      delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the
      inhibitor from excision by the viral 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Together, these 
      results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based
      assays.

AB  - In December 2019, cases of unidentified pneumonia with a history of exposure in
      the Huanan Seafood Market were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel
      coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease.
      Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by
      World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world.
      As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with
      2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 
      2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition
      of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top
      four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major
      comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary
      heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the
      virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific
      therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1
      public health response to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is
      also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment,
      which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.

AB  - Rapidly sharing scientific information is an effective way to reduce public panic
      about COVID-19, and doing so is the key to providing real-time guidance to
      epidemiologists working to contain the outbreak, clinicians managing patients,
      and modelers helping to understand future developments and the possible
      effectiveness of various interventions. This issue has rapidly reviewed and
      published articles describing COVID-19, including the drug treatment options for 
      SARS-CoV-2, its clinical characteristics, and therapies involving a combination
      of Chinese and Western medicine, the efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the
      treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia according to clinical studies, and
      reflections on the system of reserve medical supplies for public health
      emergencies. As an academic journal, we will continue to quickly and
      transparently share data with frontline healthcare workers who need to know the
      epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19.

LID - e55570 [pii]
AB  - Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following
      its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the
      global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand
      factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of
      emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of
      different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history
      and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate
      that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the
      factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases
      missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet
      developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the
      need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being
      missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy
      to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future
      emerging pathogens.

AB  - On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical
      pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The 
      first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019.
      Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to
      bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500
      laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV,
      infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been
      confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including
      Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United
      States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has
      also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one
      provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of
      infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is 
      now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been
      infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions
      that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission?
      What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the
      vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection
      against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the
      generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in
      gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic
      development. Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at

AB  - Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than
      forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese
      government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made
      the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak,
      the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where 
      the 2019-nCoV had originated-Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten
      days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant
      difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other
      provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic
      restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial 
      support and improved research ability, along with network communication
      technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention
      measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective
      treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in
      policy formulation-public health experts, the government, and the general public.
      It was also aided by media and information technology, as well as international
      cooperation. This experience will provide China and other countries with valuable
      lessons for quickly coordinating and coping with future public health
      emergencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread
      from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in
      12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one
      case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a
      country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of
      African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. METHODS: We used
      data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected
      provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per
      country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with
      two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations
      Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious
      Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese
      regions contributing most to their risk. FINDINGS: Countries with the highest
      importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high
      capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria,
      Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and
      high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same
      exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the
      city of Beijing, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Many countries in Africa are
      stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations.
      Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently
      prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect 
      imported cases and to limit onward transmission. FUNDING: EU Framework Programme

AB  - Objective: To raise awareness about 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and
      reduce missed diagnosis rate and misdiagnosis rate by comparing the clinical
      characteristics between RNA positive and negative patients clinically diagnosed
      with NCP. Methods: From January 2020 to February 2020, 54 patients who were newly
      diagnosed with NCP in Wuhan Fourth Hospital were included in this study. RT-PCR
      method was used to measure the level of 2019-nCov RNA in pharyngeal swab samples 
      of these patients. The patients were divided into RNA positive and negative
      group, and the differences of clinical, laboratory, and radiological
      characteristics were compared. Results: There were 31 RNA of 2019-nCov positive
      cases, and 23 negative cases. Common clinical symptoms of two groups were fever
      (80.64% vs. 86.96%) , chills (61.29% vs.52.17%) , cough (80.64% vs.95.65%) ,
      fatigue (61.30% vs.56.52%) , chest distress (77.42% vs.73.91%) . Some other
      symptoms were headache, myalgia, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The
      laboratory and radiological characteristics of two groups mainly were
      lymphopenia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased C-reactive
      protein, increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased oxygenation index, normal
      white blood cell count and bilateral chest CT involvement. There was no
      statistically significant difference in other clinical characteristics except for
      dyspnea between two groups. Conclusions: RNA positive and negative NCP patients
      shared similar clinical symptoms, while RNA positive NCP patients tended to have 
      dyspnea. Therefore, we should improve the understanding of NCP to prevent missed 
      diagnosis and misdiagnosis; In addition, more rapid and accurate NCP diagnostic
      approaches should be further developed.

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak
      of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China,
      which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention
      around the world. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral
      drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the
      novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate
      their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential 
      drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and
      therapeutic countermeasures. Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features,
      including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention
      and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.

TI  - The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest
      global health threats: what lessons have we learned?
LID - dyaa033 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyaa033 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and
      identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a
      critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their
      spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus
      outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus
      (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed
      literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms,
      treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk
      factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS:
      Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited
      reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of
      COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.
      Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to
      increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large
      hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major 
      international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the 
      outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub
      located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and
      eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two
      prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges 
      the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the
      uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the
      spread of infection.

AB  - In December 2019, a new outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia began to occur. Its
      pathogen is 2019-nCoV, which has the characteristics of strong infectivity and
      general susceptibility. The current situation of prevention and control of new
      coronavirus pneumonia is severe. In this context, as front-line medical workers
      bearing important responsibilities and pressure, while through strict management 
      strategy, we can minimize the risk of infection exposure. By summarizing the
      research progress and guidelines in recent years in the fields of colorectal
      cancer disease screening, treatment strategies(including early colorectal cancer,
      locally advanced colorectal cancer, obstructive colorectal cancer, metastatic
      colorectal cancer and the treatment of patients after neoadjuvant therapy), the
      choice of medication and time limit for adjuvant therapy, the protective measures
      for patients undergoing emergency surgery, the re-examination of postoperative
      patients and the protection of medical staff, etc., authors improve treatment
      strategies in order to provide more choices for patients to obtain the best
      treatment under the severe epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia.
      Meanwhile we hope that it can also provide more timely treatment modeling schemes
      for colleagues.

AB  - The next decade is likely to produce any number of global challenges that will
      affect health and health care, including pan-national infections such as the new 
      coronavirus COVID-19 and others that will be related to global warming. Nurses
      will be required to react to these events, even though they will also be affected
      as ordinary citizens. The future resilience of healthcare services will depend on
      having sufficient numbers of nurses who are adequately resourced to face the
      coming challenges.

      a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health
      Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been
      identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China.
      On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health
      emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two
      bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 
      and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or 
      direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period
      of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with
      pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), 
      fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement 
      with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography
      images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is
      responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China.
      Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the
      primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep
      monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus
      and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

AB  - The 2019-nCoV infection that is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus was first
      detected in China in the end of December 2019 and declared a public health
      emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on January
      30, 2020. Community pharmacists in one of the first areas that had confirmed
      cases of the viral infection, Macau, joined the collaborative force in supporting
      the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements. This paper
      aimed to improve the understanding of community pharmacists' role in case of
      2019-CoV outbreak based on the practical experiences in consultation with the
      recommendations made by the International Pharmaceutical Federation on the
      Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak.

      Coronavirus Infections with Right Truncation: A Statistical Analysis of Publicly 
      Available Case Data.
LID - E538 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020538 [doi]
AB  - The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the
      epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural
      history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data
      from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period
      and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19
      infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of
      2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated
      using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to
      hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days
      without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th
      percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of
      quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from
      illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when 
      estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.

      for critically ill patients infected by 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia].
PG  - E020

AB  - Definite evidence has shown that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could be
      transmitted from person to person, so far more than 1,700 bedside clinicians have
      been infected. A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are
      deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation,
      manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal
      cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due
      to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus. As such, we
      developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based
      on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with
      the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the 
      COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Those recommendations include: (1) Standard
      prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during
      HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the
      ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated
      humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port 
      and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter
      between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing
      patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients
      receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port 
      to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation,
      cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction
      catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated
      wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9. For
      patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between
      ventilator and patient; (10) PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous
      breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT. When tracheotomy patients
      are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or
      tracheostomy mask. (11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For
      patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with
      spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh
      nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is
      recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during
      nebulization.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of cases of novel coronavirus 
      pneumonia and a preliminary study to explore the relationship between different
      clinical classification and liver damage. Methods: Consecutively confirmed novel 
      coronavirus infection cases admitted to seven designated hospitals during January
      23, 2020 to February 8, 2020 were included. Clinical classification (mild,
      moderate, severe, and critical) was carried out according to the diagnosis and
      treatment program of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition) issued by 
      the National Health Commission. The research data were analyzed using SPSS19.0
      statistical software. Quantitative data were expressed as median (interquartile
      range), and qualitative data were expressed as frequency and rate. Results: 32
      confirmed cases that met the inclusion criteria were included. 28 cases were of
      mild or moderate type (87.50%), and four cases (12.50%) of severe or critical
      type. Four cases (12.5%) were combined with one underlying disease (bronchial
      asthma, coronary heart disease, malignant tumor, chronic kidney disease), and one
      case (3.13%) was simultaneously combined with high blood pressure and malignant
      tumor. The results of laboratory examination showed that the alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), and
      total bilirubin (TBil) for entire cohort were 26.98 (16.88 ~ 46.09) U/L and 24.75
      (18.71 ~ 31.79) U/L, 39.00 (36.20 ~ 44.20) g/L and 16.40 (11.34- ~ 21.15) mmol/L,
      respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the mild or moderate subgroups were 22.75
      (16.31- ~ 37.25) U/L, 23.63 (18.71 ~ 26.50) U/L, 39.70 (36.50 ~ 46.10) g/L, and
      15.95 (11.34 ~ 20.83) mmol/L, respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the severe 
      or critical subgroups were 60.25 (40.88 ~ 68.90) U/L, 37.00 (20.88 ~ 64.45) U/L, 
      35.75 (28.68 ~ 42.00) g/L, and 20.50 (11.28 ~ 25.00) mmol/L, respectively.
      Conclusion: The results of this multicenter retrospective study suggests that
      novel coronavirus pneumonia combined with liver damage is more likely to be
      caused by adverse drug reactions and systemic inflammation in severe patients
      receiving medical treatment. Therefore, liver function monitoring and evaluation 
      should be strengthened during the treatment of such patients.

AB  - Objective: To explore and analyze the possible mechanism of liver injury in
      patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (novel coronavirus pneumonia, NCP).
      Methods: The correlation between ALT, AST and other liver enzyme changes
      condition and NCP patients' disease status reported in the literature was
      comprehensively analyzed. ACE2 expression in liver tissue for novel coronavirus
      was analyzed based on single cell sequencing (GSE115469) data. RNA-Seq method was
      used to analyze Ace2 expression and transcription factors related to its
      expression in liver tissues at various time-points after hepatectomy in mouse
      model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy. t-test or Spearman rank
      correlation analysis was used for statistical analysis. Results: ALT and AST were
      abnormally elevated in some patients with novel coronavirus infection, and the
      rate and extent of ALT and AST elevation in severe NCP patients were higher than 
      those in non-severe patients. Liver tissue results of single cell sequencing and 
      immunohistochemistry showed that ACE2 was only expressed in bile duct epithelial 
      cells of normal liver tissues, and very low in hepatocytes. In a mouse model of
      acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy, Ace2 expression was down-regulated
      on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the normal level on the
      third day, and returned to normal level on seventh day when the liver recovered
      and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. Whether this phenomenon suggests that the
      bile duct epithelial cells with positive expression of Ace2 participate in the
      process of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy deserves further study.
      In RNA-Seq data, 77 transcription factors were positively correlated with the
      expression of ACE2 (r > 0.2, FDR < 0.05), which were mainly enriched in the
      development, differentiation, morphogenesis and cell proliferation of glandular
      epithelial cells. Conclusion: We assumed that in addition to the over activated
      inflammatory response in patients with NCP, the up-regulation of ACE2 expression 
      in liver tissue caused by compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from 
      bile duct epithelial cells may also be the possible mechanism of liver tissue
      injury caused by 2019 novel coronavirus infection.

AB  - Since late December 2019, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases
      (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. With the spread of
      COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients
      has been disturbed. Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients
      caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more
      susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Furthermore, patients with
      cancer had poorer prognosis from infection. Lung cancer patients should be the
      priority group for COVID-19 prevention. The protection provisions and control
      measures aiming to protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been
      increasingly concerned. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be
      carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer
      patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of
      COVID-19. Moreover, it is necessary to carry out meticulous and individualized
      clinical management for lung cancer patients to effectively protect the patients 
      from COVID-19.

AB  - In December 2019, China diagnosed the first patient with 2019 novel coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19), and the following development of the epidemic had a huge
      impact on China and the whole world. For patients with lung occupying lesions,
      the whole process of diagnosis and treatment can not be carried out as usual due 
      to the epidemic. For thoracic surgeons, the timing of surgical intervention
      should be very carefully considered. All thoracic surgeons in China should work
      together to develop the proper procedures for the diagnosis and treatment in this
      special situation, and continuously update the recommendations based on epidemic 
      changes and further understanding of COVID-19. Here, we only offer some
      preliminary suggestions based on our own knowledge for further reference and
      discussion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread.
      We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients 
      infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Electronic medical records including
      demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and
      radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed
      result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: An
      approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found,
      with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community-acquired
      cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal
      symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas
      hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common
      comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were
      self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not
      reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD,
      1.4%) patients and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or
      patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding.
      Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood
      eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r =
      .486, P < .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P < .001) patients after hospital
      admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and
      procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients
      (all P < .001). CONCLUSION: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized
      COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential 
      indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors
      for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more
      prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics of patients in Zhejiang
      province, China, infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019).
      DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province,
      China. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed
      SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January
      2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data, collected using a standardised case
      report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If
      information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor
      responsible for treating the patient for clarification. RESULTS: Of the 62
      patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive
      care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of 
      the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan
      seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected
      by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were
      fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%),
      headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and
      haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on
      admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days
      (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital
      admission was 2 (1-4) days. CONCLUSION: As of early February 2020, compared with 
      patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in
      Zhejiang province are relatively mild.

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak in
      Wuhan, and has quickly spread to all provinces in China and 26 other countries
      around the world, leading to a serious situation for epidemic prevention. So far,
      there is still no specific medicine. Previous studies have shown that chloroquine
      phosphate (chloroquine) had a wide range of antiviral effects, including
      anti-coronavirus. Here we found that treating the patients diagnosed as novel
      coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success rate of
      treatment, shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome. In order to guide
      and regulate the use of chloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia,
      the multicenter collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of
      Guangdong Province and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in
      the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia developed this expert consensus
      after extensive discussion. It recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, 500mg
      twice per day for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe
      cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia and without contraindications to
      chloroquine.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and

      China. Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to
      have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated
      pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China. The drug is
      recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the
      Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by
      the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of
      COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future.

AB  - At the end of 2019, pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV) emerged in 
      Wuhan city, China. Many airline travelers moved between Wuhan and Japan at that
      time, suggesting that Japan is at high risk of invasion by the virus. Diagnostic 
      systems for 2019-nCoV were developed with urgency. Two nested RT-PCR assays and
      two real-time RT-PCR assays were adapted to local Japanese conditions. As of 8
      February 2020, the assays developed have successfully detected 25 positive cases 
      of infection in Japan.

AB  - The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than
      11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a
      serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific
      antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of
      receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess
      the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein,
      which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and
      therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that
      a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with
      2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the
      ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may
      have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in
      combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment 
      of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific
      neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of 
      SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in 
      the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity 
      of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel
      monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.

AB  - The epidemiological history and clinical characteristics of 7 cases of COVID-19
      and 1 case of close contact in the first family aggregation epidemic of COVID-19 
      in Gansu Province were analyzed. The first patient A developed on January 22,
      2020, with a history of residence in Wuhan, and confirmed severe cases of NCP on 
      January 24, 2020; patient B, on January 23, 2020, diagnosed on January 31, severe
      cases; patient C, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient D, asymptomatic,
      diagnosed on January 27; patient E, on January 24, diagnosed on January 28;
      patient F, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 31; Patient G was asymptomatic and 
      was diagnosed on January 31. In close contact, H was asymptomatic, PCR test was
      negative and asymptomatic, and he was discharged early. Among the 7 patients, 1
      case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively
      controlled after active treatment. Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were 
      positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative. In this
      clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies
      were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to
      control the epidemic. Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose
      pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test is negative but with ground glass-like lung
      lesions is very important for early detection and early isolation.

AB  - Objective: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan,
      China has spread quickly nationwide. Here, we report results of a descriptive,
      exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All
      COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's
      Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient
      characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3)
      calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of
      viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis.
      Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186
      (22.4%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6%) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and
      889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%)-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed 
      cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and
      considered mild (80.9%). A total of 1 023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases
      for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. The COVID-19 spread outward from Hubei
      sometime after December 2019 and by February 11, 2020, 1 386 counties across all 
      31 provinces were affected. The epidemic curve of onset of symptoms peaked in
      January 23-26, then began to decline leading up to February 11. A total of 1 716 
      health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3%). Conclusions: The
      COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. It only took 30 days to expand from
      Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long
      holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic.

AB  - Objective: To describe the characteristics of clinical manifestations and
      epidemiology of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.
      Methods: All 34 children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by
      quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR through nasopharyngeal swab
      specimens were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January
      19 to Febuary 7, 2020. Clinical data and epidemiological history of these
      patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: Among the 34
      cases, 14 were males, and 20 were females. The median age was 8 years and 11
      months. No patients had underlying diseases. There were 28 children (82%) related
      with a family cluster outbreak. There were 26 children (76%) with a travel or
      residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into
      different clinical types, including 22 (65%) common cases, 9 (26%) mild cases and
      3 (8.8%) asymptomatic cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The
      most common symptoms were fever (17 cases, 50%) and cough (13 cases, 38% ). In
      the 34 cases, the white blood cell counts of 28 cases (82%) were normal. Five
      cases had white blood cell counts more than 10x10(9)/L. One case had white blood 
      cell counts less than 4x10(9)/L. Neutropenia and lymphopenia was found in one
      case, respectively. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rates
      were elevated in 1 and 5 case, respectively. Elevated procalcitonin was found in 
      1 case and D-Dimer in 3 cases. The levels of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were more
      than 400 U/L in 10 cases. The CT images of these patients showed bilateral
      multiple patchy or nodular ground-glass opacities and/or infiltrating shadows in 
      middle and outer zone of the lung or under the pleura. Twenty patients were
      treated with lopinavir and ritonavir. Glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin were not
      used in any cases. All the cases improved and were discharged from hospital.
      Further following up was need. Conclusions: The clinical manifestations in
      children with 2019-nCoV infection are non-specific and are milder than that in
      adults. Chest CT scanning is heplful for early diagnosis. Children's infection is
      mainly caused by family cluster outbreak and imported cases. Family daily
      prevention is the main way to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.

AB  - Objective: To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was
      performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with
      2019-nCoV. They were admitted to the third people's Hospital of Shenzhen from
      January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary
      lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, there
      were 5 males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years old. Five of the 15 children
      were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on first visit. The first nasal or
      pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic
      acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9
      patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions. Seven cases of small nodular ground 
      glass opacities and 2 cases of speckled ground glass opacities were found. After 
      3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample
      turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 
      cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. Other 9 cases were
      still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest
      CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular
      ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with
      2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical
      symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic
      reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2,
      leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. At present,
      there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an
      important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and 
      ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system
      inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe
      pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively
      relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding
      of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang
      (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was
      broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia.
      Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients
      with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and
      might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.

AB  - Based on the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, the
      Wuhan pneumonia caused by an unknown etiology should be recognized as the first
      Disease X. Later, the pathogen was identified to be a novel coronavirus denoted
      2019-nCoV, which has 79.5% and 96% whole genome sequence identify to SARS-CoV and
      bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13), respectively, suggesting its
      potential bat origin. With high human-to-human transmission rate (R0), 2019-nCoV 
      has quickly spread in China and other countries, resulting in 34,953 confirmed
      cases and 725 deaths as of 8 February 2020, thus calling for urgent development
      of therapeutics and prophylactics. Here we suggest renaming 2019-nCoV as
      "transmissible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (TARS-CoV)" and briefly
      review the advancement of research and development of neutralizing antibodies and
      vaccines targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and viral fusion inhibitors 
      targeting the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain in spike protein of 2019-nCoV.

AB  - Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is a highly infectious disease, has a long
      incubation period and a variety of clinical manifestations, which has a
      significant impact on public health and life. Afterwards, scientific and
      standardized work processing during the epidemic is of great significance for
      prevention and control. In order to implement the central government's
      decision-making deployment and defeat the NCP as soon as possible, we had focused
      on the key points in the clinical work of general surgery according to latest
      relevant guidelines, literature and experience in epidemic prevention. Finally,
      we drafted the prevention and control strategies and recommendations to make a
      reference for medical staff of general surgery to fight NCP.

AB  - The New Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP, also named as COVID-19 by WHO on Feb 11 2020,
      is now causing a severe public health emergency in China since. The number of
      diagnosed cases is more than 40,000 until the submission of this manuscript.
      Coronavirus has caused several epidemic situations world widely, but the present 
      contagious disease caused by 2019 new Coronavirus is unprecedentedly fulminating.
      The published cohorts of 2019 new Coronavirus (n-Cov) are single-center studies, 
      or retrospective studies. We here share the therapeutic experiences of NCP
      treatment with literature review. Combination of Ribavirin and Interferon-alpha
      is recommended by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised
      Edition) because of the effect on MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and
      the effectiveness of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Remdisivir needs to be confirmed by 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), given the situation of no specific antivirus
      drug on NCP is unavailable. Systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended as a
      short term use (1~2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), 3~5d ) by the 5(th) edition National Health 
      Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) yet RCTs are expected to confirm the
      effectiveness. Inappropriate application of antibiotics should be avoided,
      especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics, for the NCP is not
      often complicated with bacterial infection.

AB  - Since mid-December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has
      been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea 
      are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have
      occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns
      about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed
      with COVID-19 infection in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had 
      mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of
      hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on 
      day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and
      three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of 
      the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China.
      Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered,
      beta-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavirus
      titers were observed.

AB  - Since the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or officially named by the World
      Health Organization as COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in
      2019, there have been a few reports of its imaging findings. Here, we report two 
      confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia with chest computed tomography findings of
      multiple regions of patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacities in both
      lungs. These findings were characteristically located along the bronchial bundle 
      or subpleural lungs.

TI  - Initial CT findings and temporal changes in patients with the novel coronavirus
      pneumonia (2019-nCoV): a study of 63 patients in Wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1007/s00330-020-06731-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to observe the imaging characteristics 
      of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. METHODS: Sixty-three confirmed patients were 
      enrolled from December 30, 2019 to January 31, 2020. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of
      the chest was performed. The number of affected lobes, ground glass nodules
      (GGO), patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, patchy consolidation, fibrous
      stripes and irregular solid nodules in each patient's chest CT image were
      recorded. Additionally, we performed imaging follow-up of these patients.
      RESULTS: CT images of 63 confirmed patients were collected. M/F ratio: 33/30. The
      mean age was 44.9 +/- 15.2 years. The mean number of affected lobes was 3.3 +/-
      1.8. Nineteen (30.2%) patients had one affected lobe, five (7.9%) patients had
      two affected lobes, four (6.3%) patients had three affected lobes, seven (11.1%) 
      patients had four affected lobes while 28 (44.4%) patients had 5 affected lobes. 
      Fifty-four (85.7%) patients had patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, 14
      (22.2%) patients had GGO, 12 (19.0%) patients had patchy consolidation, 11
      (17.5%) patients had fibrous stripes and 8 (12.7%) patients had irregular solid
      nodules. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients progressed, including single GGO increased, 
      enlarged and consolidated; fibrous stripe enlarged, while solid nodules increased
      and enlarged. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging changes in novel viral pneumonia are rapid.
      The manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia are diverse. Imaging
      changes of typical viral pneumonia and some specific imaging features were
      observed. Therefore, we need to strengthen the recognition of image changes to
      help clinicians to diagnose quickly and accurately. KEY POINTS: * High-resolution
      CT (HRCT) of the chest is critical for early detection, evaluation of disease
      severity and follow-up of patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia. * The
      manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia are diverse and change rapidly.
      * Radiologists should be aware of the various features of the disease and
      temporal changes.

AB  - The continued emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases with a
      high case fatality rate stresses the need for the availability of effective
      antiviral treatments. Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus
      (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of
      prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of 
      MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment
      initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced
      clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues,
      and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment
      initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a
      reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and
      decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support 
      testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical
      trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including
      the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.

AB  - In December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan City in
      central China's Hubei Province. Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from
      patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the
      etiology (1). As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had
      been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other
      countries, including 11 in the United States (2,3). On January 17, CDC and the
      U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health
      screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City
      (4). CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a
      process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection
      (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public 
      health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 
      650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria
      for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic
      persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had
      travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill
      laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and
      contact-related risks. Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV
      infection. Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to identifying
      cases and preventing further transmission. Health care providers should remain
      vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices
      when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection (6). Providers should
      consult with their local and state health departments when assessing not only ill
      travelers from 2019-nCoV-affected countries but also ill persons who have been in
      close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the 
      United States.

TI  - Time Course of Lung Changes On Chest CT During Recovery From 2019 Novel
      Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia.

AB  - Background Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in
      COVID-19 pneumonia. Purpose To determine the change in chest CT findings
      associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery.
      Materials and Methods This retrospective review included patients with RT-PCR
      confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February
      2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any
      time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat Chest CT was obtained at
      approximately 4 day intervals. The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement
      (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined.
      Results Twenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with
      confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. These patients under went a total of
      82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 4+/-1 days (range: 1-8 days). All
      patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized period of 17+/-4 days (range: 
      11-26 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the
      calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25),
      p<0.001). Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4
      stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) 
      in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 2+/-2; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days):
      increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT
      score (6+/-4, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%)
      patients with the peak of total CT score (7+/-4); (4) Stage-4 (>/=14 days):
      gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total
      CT score (6+/-4) without crazy-paving pattern. Conclusion In patients recovering 
      from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease
      course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10
      days after initial onset of symptoms.

AB  - An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has posed
      significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of
      treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to 
      control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all
      treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus
      infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific
      treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We
      suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated 
      before the administration of general treatments and the current children's
      RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected
      people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given 
      to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the
      potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the
      infection is uncontrollable.

TI  - Practical recommendations for critical care and anesthesiology teams caring for
      novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patients.

AB  - A global health emergency has been declared by the World Health Organization as
      the 2019-nCoV outbreak spreads across the world, with confirmed patients in
      Canada. Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory
      failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal
      treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is 
      necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare 
      workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are
      currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of
      airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in
      specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding 
      patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment,
      resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations 
      planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local
      outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is
      evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness
      regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.

AB  - Since December 2019, a cluster of patients have been diagnosed to be infected
      with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China. The epidemic has been
      spreading to other areas of the country and abroad. A few cases have progressed
      rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or multiple organ function
      failure. The epidemiological survey has indicated that the general population is 
      susceptible to 2019-nCoV. A total of 14 children (6 months to 14 years of age,
      including 5 cases in Wuhan) have been confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV in 
      China so far. In order to further standardize and enhance the clinical management
      of 2019-nCoV infection in children, reduce the incidence, and decrease the number
      of severe cases, we have formulated this diagnosis and treatment recommendation
      according to the recent information at home and abroad.

PG  - 91-95
AB  - 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been spreading in China since
      December 2019. Neonates are presumably the high-risk population susceptible to
      2019-nCoV due to immature immune function. The neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU) should be prepared for 2019-nCoV infections as far as possible. The
      emergency response plan enables the efficient response capability of NICU. During
      the epidemic of 2019-nCoV, the emergency response plan for the NICU should be
      based on the actual situation, including diagnosis, isolation, and treatment, as 
      well as available equipment and staffing, and take into account the psychosocial 
      needs of the families and neonatal care staff.

      coronavirus infection (1st Edition)].
PG  - 87-90
AB  - Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been
      prevalent in China. Due to immaturity of immune function and the possibility of
      mother-fetal vertical transmission, neonates are particularly susceptible to
      2019-nCoV. The perinatal-neonatal departments should cooperate closely and take
      integrated approaches, and the neonatal intensive care unit should prepare the
      emergency plan for 2019-nCoV infection as far as possible, so as to ensure the
      optimal management and treatment of potential victims. According to the latest
      2019-nCoV national management plan and the actual situation, the Working Group
      for the Prevention and Control of Neonatal 2019-nCoV Infection in the Perinatal
      Period of the Editorial Committee of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics
      puts forward recommendations for the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV
      infection in neonates.

TI  - Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from (Wuhan) Coronavirus 2019-nCoV
      Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus
      Infections.
LID - E194 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v12020194 [doi]
AB  - In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was
      identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of
      China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a
      newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV. The infection moved rapidly
      through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries
      through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple
      countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing
      the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from
      human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is
      estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in
      special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus 
      infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have 
      become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the
      potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity 
      and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published
      data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other
      coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are
      also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials,
      and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.

LID - 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000270 [doi]
AB  - In late December 2019 a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the
      2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged from Wuhan, China and resulted in a
      formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanding globally, including
      Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, USA, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country
      (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as the
      Severe Specific Contagious Pneumonia (SSCP) in 1/15/2019 and is a notifiable
      communicable disease of the 5 category by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health.
      SSCP is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2-5%)
      mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or
      contact transmission and jeopardized first-line healthcare workers if lack of
      stringent infection control or no proper personal protective equipment available.
      Currently, there is no definite treatment for SSCP although some drugs are under 
      investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading,
      physicians should be aware of travel or contact history for patients with
      compatible symptoms.

AB  - Some patients with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results
      of real time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain- reaction (RT-PCR) for 2019
      novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In this report, we present chest CT findings from 
      five patients with 2019-nCoV infection who had initial negative RT-PCR results.
      All five patients had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity
      (GGO) (5 patients) and/or mixed GGO and mixed consolidation (2 patients). After
      isolation for presumed 2019-nCoV pneumonia, all patients were eventually
      confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection by repeated swab tests. A combination of
      repeated swab tests and CT scanning may be helpful when for individuals with high
      clinical suspicion of nCoV infection but negative RT-PCR screening.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV). METHODS: Based on the
      susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption 
      that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are
      resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic
      reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and
      suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by
      other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned
      from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: The basic
      reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on
      the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall
      between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from
      international colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: The early transmission ability of
      2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease 
      with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are
      needed to prevent the further transmissions.

AB  - The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei
      province, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other
      countries. Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and
      radiological characteristics, as well as potential biomarkers for predicting
      disease severity in 2019-nCoV-infected patients in Shenzhen, China. All 12 cases 
      of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most common laboratory
      abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of
      lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count. The viral load of 2019-nCoV
      detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease
      severity. ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the 
      acute lung injury. Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry
      indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of
      disease severity. Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from
      2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to
      viral load and lung injury. Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis
      biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing
      treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.

AB  - We evaluated effectiveness of thermal passenger screening for 2019-nCoV infection
      at airport exit and entry to inform public health decision-making. In our
      baseline scenario, we estimated that 46% (95% confidence interval: 36 to 58) of
      infected travellers would not be detected, depending on incubation period,
      sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and proportion of asymptomatic cases.
      Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV
      infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers.

AB  - Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to
      interrupt the spread of this virus. We assessed the required expertise and
      capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30
      European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight
      laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 
      2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February.
      Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main
      implementation barriers.

TI  - Estimation of the Transmission Risk of the 2019-nCoV and Its Implication for
      Public Health Interventions.
LID - E462 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020462 [doi]
AB  - Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and
      neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of
      mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity
      of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of
      disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was
      devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status 
      of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on
      likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as
      high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions,
      such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can
      effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with
      the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in
      Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand
      baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive
      measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention 
      and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained.
      Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two 
      weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel
      restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected 
      individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the
      scenario of no travel restriction.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus cases in tertiary hospitals in
      Hubei Province.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000744 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in
      Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to
      investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, 
      treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this
      outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to
      the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary
      hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were
      retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations,
      laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens.
      RESULTS: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median
      age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale
      Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137,
      48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical
      initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations,
      diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white 
      blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was
      present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions
      in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed
      with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective
      drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G
      was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions.
      Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably,
      early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis.
      The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases,
      and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea.
      CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever
      as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of
      viral pneumonia on chest imaging. Middle-aged and elderly patients with
      underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a
      poorer prognosis.

TI  - Critical care management of adults with community-acquired severe respiratory
      viral infection.
PG  - 315-328
LID - 10.1007/s00134-020-05943-5 [doi]
AB  - With the expanding use of molecular assays, viral pathogens are increasingly
      recognized among critically ill adult patients with community-acquired severe
      respiratory illness; studies have detected respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in
      17-53% of such patients. In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic
      coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019
      nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care
      present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most
      widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that
      early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with
      influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for
      other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been
      studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides,
      corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza 
      immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. 
      Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe
      respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI
      causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a
      high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge
      highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive
      pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe
      RVI. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different
      therapeutics both individually and in combination.

TI  - A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern 
      China.
PG  - 77-85
LID - 10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic
      disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are 
      known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading 
      to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing
      appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in
      rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and
      enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and
      field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and
      protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community
      and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field
      observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human-animal
      interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities
      were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes 
      existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study explored the relationship among zoonotic risk and human
      behaviour, environment and policies in rural communities in southern China. It
      identifies key behavioural risk factors that can be targeted for development of
      tailored risk-mitigation strategies to reduce the threat of novel zoonoses.

AB  - Pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is continuously 
      and rapidly circulating at present. No effective antiviral treatment has been
      verified thus far. We report here the clinical characteristics and therapeutic
      procedure for four patients with mild or severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia admitted to
      Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. All the patients were given antiviral
      treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra((R))), arbidol, and Shufeng
      Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC, a traditional Chinese medicine) and other necessary support
      care. After treatment, three patients gained significant improvement in pneumonia
      associated symptoms, two of whom were confirmed 2019-nCoV negative and
      discharged, and one of whom was virus negative at the first test. The remaining
      patient with severe pneumonia had shown signs of improvement by the cutoff date
      for data collection. Results obtained in the current study may provide clues for 
      treatment of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The efficacy of antiviral treatment including
      lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC warrants further verification in future
      study.

AB  - Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a
      global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans.
      Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between
      2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. 
      We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the
      persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well
      as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection,
      e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human
      coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus,
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human
      coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or
      plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface
      disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1%
      sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05-0.2%
      benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As
      no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and
      prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to 
      control this novel infectious thread.

      children: experts' consensus statement.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-020-00343-7 [doi]
AB  - Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City,
      China, by January 30, 2020, a total of 9692 confirmed cases and 15,238 suspected 
      cases have been reported around 31 provinces or cities in China. Among the
      confirmed cases, 1527 were severe cases, 171 had recovered and been discharged at
      home, and 213 died. And among these cases, a total of 28 children aged from 1
      month to 17 years have been reported in China. For standardizing prevention and
      management of 2019-nCoV infections in children, we called up an experts'
      committee to formulate this experts' consensus statement. This statement is based
      on the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards
      (the fourth edition) (National Health Committee) and other previous diagnosis and
      treatment strategies for pediatric virus infections. The present consensus
      statement summarizes current strategies on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention
      of 2019-nCoV infection in children.

TI  - Molecular Diagnosis of a Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Causing an Outbreak of
      Pneumonia.
LID - hvaa029 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvaa029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been 
      identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically 
      similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was
      initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been
      detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been
      reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate
      human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus
      are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We
      developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to
      detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and
      probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely
      related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a
      panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from 
      two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from
      cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown
      to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000
      TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits 
      of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative
      control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected 
      patients were positive in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can
      achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early
      identification of patients.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel
      Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1001/jama.2020.1585 [doi]
AB  - Importance: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia
      (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but
      information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.
      Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. 
      Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of
      the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan
      Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020;
      final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main
      Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory,
      radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of
      critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed
      hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals 
      or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source 
      of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP,
      the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 
      75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the
      presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and 
      hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]),
      fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 
      0.8 x 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients
      (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80
      patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55
      patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy
      shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients
      received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received
      antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%];
      azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six
      patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of
      complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]),
      arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first
      symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS 
      was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not
      treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were
      more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were
      more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] 
      vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen
      therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received
      invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As
      of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality,
      4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged 
      alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). Conclusions
      and Relevance: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients
      with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of
      2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care,
      and mortality was 4.3%.

AB  - In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei
      Province; and then named "2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)" by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced
      respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it
      attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the
      request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV
      infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be
      developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice
      guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also

AB  - On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of
      acute respiratory illness in persons associated with the Hunan seafood and animal
      market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China. On January 7,
      2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was
      associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of
      20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425
      deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2).
      Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China,
      including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). 
      As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30,
      the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV 
      outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(dagger) 
      On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary
      declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.( section sign)
      Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a "Proclamation on 
      Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of
      Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus," which limits entry into the United States
      of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent
      residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and
      local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures
      to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). These measures
      require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and
      the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to 
      the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of
      additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might
      not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the
      virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of
      illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general
      public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness
      occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health
      recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including
      diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring
      the situation closely. As more is learned about this novel virus and this
      outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by 
      CDC and state and local health departments.

AB  - To investigate the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of
      the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and beyond, a total of 32 genomes of virus
      strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with sampling dates between 24 
      December 2019 and 23 January 2020 were analyzed. Phylogenetic, transmission
      network, and likelihood-mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed. 
      On the basis of the likelihood-mapping analysis, the increasing tree-like signals
      (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing
      genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV in human hosts. We identified three phylogenetic
      clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters
      using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both
      methods using the above genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains. The estimated mean
      evolutionary rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 1.7926 x 10(-3) to 1.8266 x 10(-3)
      substitutions per site per year. On the basis of our study, undertaking
      epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively
      impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce 2019-nCOV
      transmission in real-time.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) pneumonia and to investigate the correlation between serum
      inflammatory cytokines and severity of the disease. Methods: 29 patients with
      2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji 
      medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 
      were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data were collected and the general
      information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were
      analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were
      divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5
      cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the 
      serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the
      three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the
      clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of
      2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other
      systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial
      infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or
      decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29),
      increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal
      procalcitonin. In most patients,serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was
      significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased(15/29). Alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil),
      serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT
      findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows
      accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion
      increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the
      solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant
      differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6
      in the serum of the three groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was
      higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mildgroup. 
      However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte
      count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: The clinical
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral
      pneumonia. High resolution CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis of 
      this disease. The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to 
      predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients.

AB  - Since December 2019, an epidemic caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      infection has occurred unexpectedly in China. As of 8 pm, 31 January 2020, more
      than 20 pediatric cases have been reported in China. Of these cases, ten patients
      were identified in Zhejiang Province, with an age of onset ranging from 112 days 
      to 17 years. Following the latest National recommendations for diagnosis and
      treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (the 4th edition) and current status
      of clinical practice in Zhejiang Province, recommendations for the diagnosis and 
      treatment of respiratory infection caused by 2019-nCoV for children were drafted 
      by the National Clinical Research Center for Child Health, the National
      Children's Regional Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University
      School of Medicine to further standardize the protocol for diagnosis and
      treatment of respiratory infection in children caused by 2019-nCoV.

TI  - Estimating the Unreported Number of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Cases in China 
      in the First Half of January 2020: A Data-Driven Modelling Analysis of the Early 
      Outbreak.
LID - E388 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020388 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a
      novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to
      other parts of China and a number of foreign countries. The 2019-nCoV cases might
      have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated
      the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of
      2019-nCoV. METHODS: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in
      mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential
      growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood
      estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other
      well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI
      for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. RESULTS: We confirmed that the initial growth phase
      followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have
      resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403-540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The
      reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95%
      CI: 18-25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.
      We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49-2.63). CONCLUSION: The
      under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020
      and should be considered in future investigation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, China is currently
      recognized as a public health emergency of global concern. METHODS: We reviewed
      the currently available literature to provide up-to-date guidance on control
      measures to be implemented by public health authorities. RESULTS: Some of the
      epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV have been identified. However, there
      remain considerable uncertainties, which should be considered when providing
      guidance to public health authorities on control measures. CONCLUSIONS:
      Additional studies incorporating more detailed information from confirmed cases
      would be valuable.

AB  - The recent outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, China is caused by a novel
      coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which is genetically close to a bat-derived
      coronavirus. 2019-nCoV is categorized as beta genus coronavirus, same as the two 
      other strains - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Antiviral drugs commonly
      used in clinical practice, including neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir,
      paramivir, zanamivir, etc.), ganciclovir, acyclovir and ribavirin, are invalid
      for 2019-nCoV and not recommended. Drugs are possibly effective for 2019-nCoV
      include: remdesivir, lopinavir / ritonavir, lopinavir / ritonavir combined with
      interferon-beta, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies. But the efficacy
      and safety of these drugs for 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients need to be assessed by
      further clinical trials.

AB  - At the end of 2019, sporadic and clustered case with "pneumonia of unknown
      origin" emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province. The causative pathogen was quickly
      confirmed as "2019-nCoV" . The epidemic soon spread throughout the country and
      became a pandemic in over a month. Government and medical institutions across the
      country mobilized all kinds of resources and took a variety of measures to
      actively treat patients and stop the epidemic. Based on current studies, the
      author summarized the clinical characteristics and evolution of the novel viral
      pneumonia, and proposed the key points of diagnosis and treatment, the scientific
      management of both confirmed and suspected cases, and the scientific management
      of disease prevention and control.

      China's public health and clinical treatment. The virus belongs to the beta genus
      Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and 
      MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through 
      droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period
      could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current
      observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger
      transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related 
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor 
      SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot
      of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents,
      identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may
      inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of
      2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic
      coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and 
      control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.

AB  - Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of new infectious
      disease caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The clinical features
      include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and inflammatory pulmonary
      infiltration revealed by X ray. China rapidly identified 2019-nCoV-related
      pneumonia a statutory infectious disease. To standardize the diagnosis and
      treatment of this new infectious disease, operational guidelines for the
      diagnosis and management of 2019-nCoV infection is accomplished by Peking Union
      Medical College Hospital.

AB  - With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and 
      medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to
      optimize patient outcomes. Although little is known about the virus, an
      examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied 
      cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key
      nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed
      therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and
      macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA
      polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95
      %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an
      ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease
      inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We 
      also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in
      the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which initially began in China, has
      spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of confirmed cases
      increasing every day. With a death toll exceeding that of the SARS-CoV outbreak
      back in 2002 and 2003 in China, 2019-nCoV has led to a public health emergency of
      international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. Herein, we
      present on an overview of the currently available information on the
      pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of
      this virus.

AB  - As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed
      outside China. We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe from affected
      areas in China via air travel. We consider travel restrictions in place, three
      reported cases in France, one in Germany. Estimated risk in Europe remains high. 
      The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk. Importation from
      Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe.

AB  - On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City 
      in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).
      As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection,
      including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries. Therefore, combating 
      this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency. Here, we focus
      on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as
      potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an
      outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
      Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally,
      threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the
      size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from
      Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic
      and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and
      non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. METHODS: We used data from Dec 31,
      2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally
      (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the
      number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported
      domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of
      2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan
      and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly
      flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility
      across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent
      database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the
      Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were
      based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was
      used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic
      reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and
      presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).
      FINDINGS: In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive
      number for 2019-nCoV was 2.68 (95% CrI 2.47-2.86) and that 75 815 individuals
      (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The
      epidemic doubling time was 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8-7.1). We estimated that in the
      baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had
      imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80
      (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of
      2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that
      epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China
      with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION:
      Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese
      cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with
      close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless
      substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal
      levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in
      major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation 
      of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health
      interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied 
      for quick deployment globally. FUNDING: Health and Medical Research Fund (Hong

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit
      a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other
      provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic
      reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.
      METHODS: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate,
      we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China 
      from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the
      estimated intrinsic growth rate (gamma), we estimated R0 by using the serial
      intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as
      approximations for the true unknown SI. FINDINGS: The early outbreak data largely
      follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24
      (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold
      increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate
      substantially affect estimates of R0. CONCLUSION: The mean estimate of R0 for the
      2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1. Our
      findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due 
      to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel
      coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally 
      named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000
      cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people
      living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. 
      METHODS: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the
      Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences
      were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger
      sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions
      determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these
      2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the
      evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology
      modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the
      virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine
      patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99.98% sequence identity.
      Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived
      severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and
      bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more
      distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis
      revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus
      Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives
      bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.
      Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar
      receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid
      variation at some key residues. INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently
      divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.
      Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host 
      of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an
      intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly,
      structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution,
      adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation. FUNDING:

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the 
      epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In 
      this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of
      2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were
      confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic,
      clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed
      up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 
      (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of 
      the patients was 55.5 years (SD 13.1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV
      was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic
      diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),
      cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache
      (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%]
      patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients),
      chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and
      vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients 
      showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and
      ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients
      developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients 
      worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.
      INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely
      to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal
      respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general,
      characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an
      early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further
      investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in
      predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection. FUNDING: National Key
      R&D Program of China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human
      transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city 
      of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships 
      of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of 
      sarbecovirus. METHODS: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and
      Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic
      fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and
      Bayesian methods. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although
      closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence
      similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus
      sequences. Specifically, in the 5'-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and
      the last 3'-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a 
      single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle
      region spanning the 3'-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike
      regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the
      sarbecovirus branch. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of genetic similarity between the
      2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant
      that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has
      originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus 
      (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct
      lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential
      association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further
      attention.

AB  - An outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in Wuhan, China, has
      spread rapidly, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. We report the
      first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the United States and describe the
      identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including
      the patient's initial mild symptoms at presentation with progression to pneumonia
      on day 9 of illness. This case highlights the importance of close coordination
      between clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state, and federal
      levels, as well as the need for rapid dissemination of clinical information
      related to the care of patients with this emerging infection.

AB  - As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) have been reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China.
      At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal
      coronavirus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible
      is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Three general methods,
      which include existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs using standard assays,
      screening of a chemical library containing many existing compounds or databases, 
      and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical
      understanding of individual coronaviruses, are used to discover the potential
      antiviral treatment of human pathogen coronavirus. Lopinavir /Ritonavir,
      Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1),
      abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs
      (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such
      ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment
      options for 2019-nCoV. However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- 
      nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments.

      Pneumonia.
PG  - 1199-1207
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2001316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia
      (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January
      2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the
      epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS: We collected information on
      demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of
      laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We
      described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic
      time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated
      the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS: Among the 
      first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were 
      male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked 
      to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent
      cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1
      to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early 
      stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval 
      of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to
      be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this information, there
      is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts
      since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission
      will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.
      Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations
      at risk. (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.).

AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged 
      recently in Wuhan, China. Information on reported cases strongly indicates
      human-to-human spread, and the most recent information is increasingly indicative
      of sustained human-to-human transmission. While the overall severity profile
      among cases may change as more mild cases are identified, we estimate a risk of
      fatality among hospitalised cases at 14% (95% confidence interval: 3.9-32%).

LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates
      are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more
      widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers
      does already occur. AIM: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic
      methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus
      material available. METHODS: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 
      2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS
      coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. RESULTS: The
      workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from
      SARS-CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we
      confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a
      full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is made available
      through European Virus Archive - Global (EVAg), a European Union infrastructure
      project. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the enormous response
      capacity achieved through coordination of academic and public laboratories in
      national and European research networks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a 
      novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the
      epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and
      treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with
      suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We
      prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed
      2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were
      obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the
      International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from
      electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients 
      or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were
      also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit
      (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital
      patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. 
      Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had
      underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension
      (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49.0 years
      (IQR 41.0-58.0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood
      market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were
      fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18
      [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache
      (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).
      Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to 
      dyspnoea 8.0 days [IQR 5.0-13.0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All
      41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications
      included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]),
      acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) 
      patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU
      patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10,
      MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFalpha. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused
      clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.
      Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human
      transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus 
      was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were
      geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on
      person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. METHODS:
      In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological,
      and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented
      with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province,
      China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel
      to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were
      done. FINDINGS: From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who
      travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six
      family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the 
      novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, 
      became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the
      family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or
      animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged
      36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or 
      diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to
      our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days 
      after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had
      radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had
      more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes,
      lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate
      dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients
      were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR,
      but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes
      encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of
      this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic
      analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by
      next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is
      closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses 
      found in Chinese horseshoe bats. INTERPRETATION: Our findings are consistent with
      person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family
      settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

      most common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, 
      such as the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in
      Wuhan, China most recently, have posed great threats to global public health.
      Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral
      infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, 
      stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional
      diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies 
      or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the
      development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including
      multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging.
      This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods 
      for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human
      respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus.
      Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are
      also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and
      clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective 
      detection of respiratory virus infections.
