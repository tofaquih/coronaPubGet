TI  - Prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) 3C-like protease (3CL (pro)) structure:

AB  - We prepared the three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 (aka 2019-nCoV) 3C-like
      protease (3CL (pro)) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96%
      identity) ortholog from the SARS-CoV. All residues involved in the catalysis,
      substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the
      polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C-like cleavage sites on
      the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical
      substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that 
      some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV
      enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. With the 3CL (pro)
      molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and
      proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir 
      or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new
      coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache. The drugs
      Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be
      very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and then spread rapidly worldwide, 
      particularly to China, Japan, and South Korea. Scientists are endeavoring to find
      antivirals specific to the virus. Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol,
      remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test
      their efficacy and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      in China; some promising results have been achieved thus far. This article
      summarizes agents with potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of a new infectious 
      disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
      The clinical features include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and
      inflammatory lung infiltration. China rapidly listed SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia
      as a statutory infectious disease. To standardize the diagnosis and treatment of 
      this new infectious disease, an operational recommendation for the diagnosis and 
      management of SARS-CoV-2 infection is developed by Peking Union Medical College
      Hospital.

AB  - World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The
      virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by
      the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with
      SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from
      asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, 
      which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides 
      an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just
      crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 
      largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery,
      zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
      in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with
      SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human 
      coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency
      viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a
      proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses,
      their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes.
      Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host
      antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are 
      also discussed.

AB  - Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as
      SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However,
      there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug
      repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing
      drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug
      discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing
      methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, 
      quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in
      the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV
      whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide
      sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and
      nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved
      regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared 
      to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host
      interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV
      repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are
      further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced
      transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential
      drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus
      melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the "Complementary Exposure"
      pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target
      separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study
      offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate
      repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting
      2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed
      outside China. We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe from affected
      areas in China via air travel. We consider travel restrictions in place, three
      reported cases in France, one in Germany. Estimated risk in Europe remains high. 
      The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk. Importation from
      Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe.

LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates
      are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more
      widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers
      does already occur. AIM: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic
      methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus
      material available. METHODS: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 
      2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS
      coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. RESULTS: The
      workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from
      SARS-CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we
      confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a
      full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is made available
      through European Virus Archive - Global (EVAg), a European Union infrastructure
      project. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the enormous response
      capacity achieved through coordination of academic and public laboratories in
      national and European research networks.

AB  - The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global
      public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report
      our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed 
      (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host
      cell adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of 
      spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and
      camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our study
      also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein
      potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for
      hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique features of
      COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics.
