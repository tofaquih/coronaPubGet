TI  - Passengers' destinations from China: low risk of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      transmission into Africa and South America.

AB  - Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last
      week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27
      countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was 
      to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air
      flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou)
      to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated
      passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, 
      an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the 
      direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of
      2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination
      countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city
      reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on 
      the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st
      quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were
      destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The 
      risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the 
      WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, 
      of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia
      (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of
      the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 
      1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV
      transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which
      reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy;
      in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of
      them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of
      transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil
      showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the
      countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31
      January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe
      (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and 
      Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition,
      isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening,
      public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of 
      further spread to naive countries.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of
      an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, now named COVID-19. Most cases and
      sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been
      reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy. Since the symptoms are
      similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers
      arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common 
      infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.

AB  - As of 28 February 2020, Italy had 888 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with most
      cases in Northern Italy in the Lombardia and Veneto regions. Travel-related cases
      were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current
      epidemic in Italy. The month of February, however, has been dominated by two
      large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local 
      transmission the source of infections. Contact tracing has failed to identify
      patient zero in one of the outbreaks. As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of
      COVID-19 have died. Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are
      identical at 2.3. Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with
      fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities. It will be important
      to develop point-of-care devices to aid clinicians in stratifying elderly
      patients as early as possible to determine the potential level of care they will 
      require to improve their chances of survival from COVID-19 disease.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to
      emerge and represent a serious issue to public health. In the last twenty years, 
      several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most 
      recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first
      identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day,
      an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in
      Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first
      reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019. Published
      literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the
      beginning of December 2019. As they were unable to identify the causative agent, 
      these first cases were classified as "pneumonia of unknown etiology." The Chinese
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an
      intensive outbreak investigation program. The etiology of this illness is now
      attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family. On
      February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,
      announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a "COVID-19," which is the 
      acronym of "coronavirus disease 2019". In the past twenty years, two additional
      coronavirus epidemics have occurred. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic
      beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000
      cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has
      approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases. This
      new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally. In a
      meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR,
      2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four
      countries reporting human-to-human transmission. An additional landmark occurred 
      on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, 
      was recorded in the United States. Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV.
      Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of
      Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one
      that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs). The CoVs have become the major
      pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. They are a large family of
      single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal
      species.[1] For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species
      barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more
      severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. Interestingly, these latter viruses have
      probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts - the
      Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV - before 
      jumping to humans. The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is
      speculation that it also has an animal origin. The potential for these viruses to
      grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk.
      Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the "very
      high" level, on February 28, 2020. Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused
      by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving. On March
      11, as the number of COVID-19 cases outside China has increased 13 times and the 
      number of countries involved has tripled with more than 118,000 cases in 114
      countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. World
      governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating
      effects. Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives 
      and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat. At the same time,
      scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the
      transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and
      prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing. Many uncertainties 
      remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the
      epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its
      peak. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are
      only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community
      is our best weapon. Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to a
      progressive reduction of cases in the last few days. In Italy, in geographic
      regions of the north, initially, and subsequently throughout the peninsula,
      political and health authorities are making incredible efforts to contain a shock
      wave that is severely testing the health system. In the midst of the crisis, the 
      authors have chosen to use the "Statpearls" platform because, within the PubMed
      scenario, it represents a unique tool that may allow them to make updates in
      real-time. The aim, therefore, is to collect information and scientific evidence 
      and to provide an overview of the topic that will be continuously updated.

AB  - A novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an 
      ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December
      2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very
      recently Italy. In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to
      better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first
      introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a
      couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as
      Coronavirus Italian cases. A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using 
      a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus two closely related bat
      strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GenBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic
      analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic
      reconstruction showed that 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25
      November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide,
      including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January
      2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated
      outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of
      likely imported cases in Rome, Italy, and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this
      report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human 
      mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent
      further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool
      for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.

AB  - The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
      already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter
      of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative.
      Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%,
      this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly
      affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health
      system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are
      infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of
      patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 
      2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively
      infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows
      an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30
      000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up 
      to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help 
      political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including 
      personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the
      next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in
      Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to
      decrease within 3-4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this
      cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing
      measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.

TI  - A doubt of multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy: a preliminary overview.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25773 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of the novel beta Coronavirus, recently renamed as severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, has raised serious concerns due
      to the virus rapid dissemination worldwide. Nevertheless, there is limited
      information about the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Italy
      from surveillance studies. The shortage of complete genomic sequences available
      impairs our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 introduction and establishment in the
      country. To better understand its dynamics in Italy, we analysed complete genomes
      of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, obtained directly from clinical samples. Our phylogenetic
      reconstructions suggest possible multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2. Continued
      genomic surveillance strategies are needed to improve monitoring and
      understanding of the currently SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, which might help to
      attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases. This article is protected

AB  - Italy recorded its first case of confirmed acute respiratory case due to
      Coronavirus on February 18, 2020, soon after the initial reports in China. Since 
      that time, Italy and nations throughout the world have adopted very stringent and
      severe measures to protect populations from spread of infection. Despite these
      measures, the number of infected people is growing exponentially with a
      significant number of patients developing acute respiratory insufficiency.
      Endoscopy departments face significant risk for diffusion of respiratory diseases
      that can be spread via an airborne route, including aspiration of oral and fecal 
      material via endoscopes. The purpose of this article is to discuss the measures, 
      with specific focus on personal protection equipment and dressing code
      modalities, which have been implemented in our hospital to prevent further
      dissemination of COVID-19 infection.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the disease it causes,
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generating a rapid and tragic health
      emergency in Italy due to the need to provide assistance to an overwhelming
      number of infected patients and, at the same time, treat all the non-deferrable
      oncological and benign conditions. A panel of Italian urologists has agreed on
      possible strategies for the reorganization of urological routine practice and on 
      a set of recommendations that should facilitate the process of rescheduling both 
      surgical and outpatient activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the
      subsequent phases. This document could be a valid tool to be used in routine
      clinical practice and, possibly, a cornerstone for further discussion on the
      topic also considering the further evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also
      may provide useful recommendations for national and international urological
      societies in a condition of emergency.

AB  - Following the outbreak in China, the Lombardy region of Italy has become one of
      the areas of highest incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). As the outbreak grew to a pandemic, many centres worldwide raised
      the concern that immunocompromised patients may be at high risk of developing a
      severe respiratory disease called COVID-19. Unlike common viral agents (such as
      Adenovirus, Rhinovirus, Norovirus, Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus),
      Coronaviruses have not shown to cause a more severe disease in immunosuppressed
      patients. For this family of viruses the host innate immune response appears the 
      main driver of lung tissue damage during infection.

TI  - The clinical characteristics of pneumonia patients co-infected with 2019 novel
      coronavirus and influenza virus in Wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25781 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection emerged in Wuhan,
      China on December 2019. Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has
      been spreading quickly and many countries and territories have been affected,
      with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Influenza virus has
      been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia. It was
      found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and
      influenza virus. 5 out of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also
      diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and 
      two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical
      characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19 as well as
      influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (5 [100%]
      patients), Cough (5 [100%] patients), shortness of breath (5 [100%] patients),
      nasal tampon (3 [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (3 [60%] patients), myalgia (2
      [40%] patients), fatigue (2 [40%] patients), headache (2 [40%] patients), and
      expectoration (2 [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to 
      the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (4 [80%] patients), and
      liver function ALT and AST (2 [40%] patients, 2 [40%] patients) and C-reactive
      protein (4 [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital. They stayed 
      in hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4+/-7.02), respectively. The main
      complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1
      [20%] patients), acute liver injury (3 [60%] patients), and diarrhea (2 [40%]
      patients). All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir),
      oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics. Three patients were treated with
      glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five 
      patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all
      patients did not need ICU care and were discharged from hospital without death.
      In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection
      did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory
      findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical
      characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only. However, it is
      worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone
      to appear for those co-infection patients. This article is protected by

AB  - It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      was reported in Wuhan. So far, COVID-19 has affected 84,503 patients in 57
      countries/territories and caused 2,924 deaths in nine countries. However, the
      epidemiology data differ across countries. Although China had higher morbidity
      and mortality than other sites, the number of new cases per day in China is
      lesser than that outside of China since February 26, 2020. The incidence ranged
      from 61.4 per 1,000,000 people in Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1,000,000
      people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative
      cases/no. of days between the first reported case and February 29, 2020) was
      greatest in China (1,320.85 per day), followed by Republic of Korea (78.78 per
      day), Iran (43.11 per day), and Italy (30.62 per day). However, the DCI in other 
      countries/territories were less than 10 per day. Several effective measures
      including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks,
      extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and at once daily press conference by
      government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan.
      This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of February 29, 2020)
      with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which was much lower than that of nearby 
      countries, such as Republic of Korea and Japan. Additionally, the incidence and
      mortality were correlated with DCI. However, further study and continued
      monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several recent case reports have described common early chest
      imaging findings of lung pathology caused by 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV2)
      which appear to be similar to those seen previously in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
      infected patients. OBJECTIVE: We present some remarkable imaging findings of the 
      first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from
      Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included,
      showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS:
      Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing
      percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and
      multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up,
      apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary
      vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic 
      tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could
      be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration.
      Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with
      short-axis oval nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Although only two patients have been studied,
      these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in
      literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung
      infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor
      radiological sign of lung impairment.

TI  - 2019-ncov's epidemic in middle province of northern Italy: impact, logistic &
      strategy in the first line hospital.
PG  - 1-15

AB  - The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began in China in early December 2019 and
      rapidly has spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of
      confirmed cases increasing every day. An epidemic has been recorded since
      February 20 in a middle province in Northern Italy (Lodi's province, in the low
      Po Valley). The first line Hospital had to redesign its logistical and
      departmental structure to respond to the influx of 2019-ncov positive patients
      who needed hospitalisation. Logistical and structural strategies were guided by
      the crisis unit, managing in 8 days from the beginning of the epidemic to prepare
      the hospital ready to welcome more than 200 positive COVID19 patients with
      different ventilatory requirements, keeping clean emergency access lines and
      restoring surgical interventions and deferred urgent ordinary activity.
