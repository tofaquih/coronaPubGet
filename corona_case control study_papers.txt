AB  - BackgroundThe chest CT findings of patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have not previously been described in detail.PurposeTo
      investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV 
      pneumonia in humans.Materials and MethodsFifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women;
      age range 16-76 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using
      real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section 
      CT. The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were
      evaluated.ResultsFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with
      individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and
      cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal
      white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and
      either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count. CT
      images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO 
      with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. 
      GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure
      consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%)
      patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the
      posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more
      consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT
      scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P < .001).
      Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those
      aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P < .001). Follow-up CT in 13
      patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%)
      patients.ConclusionPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous
      ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, 
      combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic
      exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      pneumonia.(c) RSNA, 2020.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of
      COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical
      records.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general
      population. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19
      pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 
      in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19
      infection. METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were
      retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed
      COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted
      to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31,
      2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for 
      the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat
      swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients
      after the first lactation. FINDINGS: All nine patients had a caesarean section in
      their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms,
      including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in
      two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in
      two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1.0 x 10(9) cells per L).
      Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the
      patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine
      livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.
      All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of
      9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples
      from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for
      the virus. INTERPRETATION: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in 
      pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who
      developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest
      that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical
      transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy. FUNDING:

AB  - In this retrospective case series, chest CT scans of 21 symptomatic patients from
      China infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were reviewed, with
      emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings. Typical CT
      findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative 
      pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung
      distribution. Notably, lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural
      effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent. Follow-up imaging in a subset of
      patients during the study time window often demonstrated mild or moderate
      progression of disease, as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung
      opacities.

TI  - Reverse Logistics Network Design for Effective Management of Medical Waste in
      Epidemic Outbreaks: Insights from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      Outbreak in Wuhan (China).
LID - E1770 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17051770 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of an epidemic disease may pose significant treats to human beings
      and may further lead to a global crisis. In order to control the spread of an
      epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through
      establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance.
      However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an
      epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic
      outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a
      significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper
      proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse
      logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the
      best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for
      effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very
      short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based
      on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even 
      though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the
      time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be
      obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among
      other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an
      effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during
      the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary
      incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available
      data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to
      assess the effectiveness of the current solution.

TI  - Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus
      (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series.
PG  - m606
LID - 10.1136/bmj.m606 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics of patients in Zhejiang
      province, China, infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019).
      DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province,
      China. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed
      SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January
      2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data, collected using a standardised case
      report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If
      information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor
      responsible for treating the patient for clarification. RESULTS: Of the 62
      patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive
      care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of 
      the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan
      seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected
      by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were
      fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%),
      headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and
      haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on
      admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days
      (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital
      admission was 2 (1-4) days. CONCLUSION: As of early February 2020, compared with 
      patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in
      Zhejiang province are relatively mild.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection caused pneumonia. we retrospectively 
      analyzed the virus presence in the pharyngeal swab, blood, and the anal swab
      detected by real-time PCR in the clinical lab. Unexpectedly, the 2109-nCoV RNA
      was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28
      patients). Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the
      blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation 
      of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of 
      the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage.
      However, the concentration of viral RNA in the anal swab (Ct value = 24 + 39) was
      higher than in the blood (Ct value = 34 + 39) from patient 2, suggesting that the
      virus might replicate in the digestive tract. Altogether, our results confirmed
      the presence of virus RNA in extra-pulmonary sites.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) pneumonia and to investigate the correlation between serum
      inflammatory cytokines and severity of the disease. Methods: 29 patients with
      2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji 
      medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 
      were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data were collected and the general
      information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were
      analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were
      divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5
      cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the 
      serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the
      three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the
      clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of
      2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other
      systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial
      infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or
      decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29),
      increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal
      procalcitonin. In most patients, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was
      significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased (15/29). Alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil),
      serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT
      findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows
      accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion
      increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the
      solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant
      differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6
      in the serum of the three groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was
      higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mild group.
      However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte
      count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: The clinical
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral
      pneumonia. High resolution CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis of 
      this disease. The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to 
      predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients.

AB  - Pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is continuously 
      and rapidly circulating at present. No effective antiviral treatment has been
      verified thus far. We report here the clinical characteristics and therapeutic
      procedure for four patients with mild or severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia admitted to
      Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. All the patients were given antiviral
      treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra((R))), arbidol, and Shufeng
      Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC, a traditional Chinese medicine) and other necessary support
      care. After treatment, three patients gained significant improvement in pneumonia
      associated symptoms, two of whom were confirmed 2019-nCoV negative and
      discharged, and one of whom was virus negative at the first test. The remaining
      patient with severe pneumonia had shown signs of improvement by the cutoff date
      for data collection. Results obtained in the current study may provide clues for 
      treatment of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The efficacy of antiviral treatment including
      lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC warrants further verification in future
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has raised world concern since it
      emerged in Wuhan Hubei China in December, 2019. The infection may result into
      severe pneumonia with clusters illness onsets. Its impacts on public health make 
      it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias. METHODS:
      Nineteen 2019-nCoV pneumonia (NCOVID-19) and fifteen other pneumonia patients
      (NON-NCOVID-19) in out of Hubei places were involved in this study. Both
      NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19 patients were confirmed to be infected in throat
      swabs or/and sputa with or without 2019-nCoV by real-time RT-PCR. We analyzed the
      demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features from those
      patients, and compared the difference between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19.
      RESULTS: All patients had a history of exposure to confirmed case of 2019-nCoV or
      travel to Hubei before illness. The median duration, respectively, was 8
      (IQR:6~11) and 5 (IQR:4~11) days from exposure to onset in NCOVID-19 and
      NON-NCOVID-19. The clinical symptoms were similar between NCOVID-19 and
      NON-NCOVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Fifteen (78.95%)
      NCOVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while
      17 (89.47%) NCOVID-19 but 1 (6.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had multiple mottling 
      and ground-glass opacity of chest CT images. Compared to NON-NCOVID-19, NCOVID-19
      present remarkably more abnormal laboratory tests including AST, ALT, gamma-GT,
      LDH and alpha-HBDH. CONCLUSION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused similar onsets to 
      other pneumonias. CT scan may be a reliable test for screening NCOVID-19 cases.
      Liver function damage is more frequent in NCOVID-19 than NON-NCOVID-19 patients. 
      LDH and alpha-HBDH may be considerable markers for evaluation of NCOVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the 
      epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In 
      this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of
      2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were
      confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic,
      clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed
      up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 
      (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of 
      the patients was 55.5 years (SD 13.1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV
      was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic
      diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),
      cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache
      (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%]
      patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients),
      chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and
      vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients 
      showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and
      ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients
      developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients 
      worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.
      INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely
      to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal
      respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general,
      characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an
      early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further
      investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
      and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health(1-3). Despite
      intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a
      source of considerable uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently
      reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975
      cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December
      2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was
      associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was
      a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on
      26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included
      fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing(4) of a sample of
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain
      from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus 
      (and has also been referred to as '2019-nCoV'). Phylogenetic analysis of the
      complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most
      closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like
      coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously 
      been found in bats in China(5). This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of
      viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.

AB  - Objectives: The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
      South Korea was reported in January 2020, with 28 confirmed cases reported as of 
      February 14(th), 2020. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28
      cases were analyzed in response to this disease. Methods: The epidemiological
      characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with
      confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data
      and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response
      team. Results: There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: 
      Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients),
      Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient). The early symptoms were fever, sore 
      throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache. Three patients were 
      asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia. Of the 28 cases, 16 were index
      cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in
      Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients.
      The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family
      members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of
      transmission were mostly at home. Conclusion: COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 
      infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation
      cases. The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at 
      this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home. Establishing an
      early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of
      the disease.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics of medical staff with
      novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP). Methods: 30 patients infected with novel
      coronavirus referred to jianghan university hospital between January 11, 2020 and
      January 3, 2020 were studied. The data reviewed included those of clinical
      manifestations, laboratory investigation and Radiographic features. Results: The 
      patients consisted of 10 men and 20 women, including 22 doctors and 8 nurses,aged
      21~59 years(mean 35+/-8 years).They were divided to 26 common type and 4 severe
      cases, all of whom had close(within 1m) contact with patients infected of novel
      coronavirus pneumonia. The average contact times were 12 (7,16) and the average
      cumulative contact time was 2 (1.5,2.7) h.Clinical symptoms of these patients
      were fever in 23 patients (76.67%) , headache in 16 petients (53.33%) , fatigue
      or myalgia in 21patients (70%) , nausea, vomiting or diarrhea in 9 petients (30%)
      , cough in 25 petients (83.33%) , and dyspnea in 14 petients (46.67%) .Routine
      blood test revealed WBC<4.0x10(9)/L in 8 petients (26.67%) , (4-10) x10(9)/L in
      22 petients (73.33%) , and WBC>4.0x10(9)/L in 4 petients (13.33%) during the
      disease.Lymphocyte count<1.0x10(9)/L occurred in 12 petients (40%),abnormal liver
      function in 7 petients (23.33%) ,myocardial damage in 5 petients(16.67%),
      elevated D-dimer (>0.5mg/l) in 5 patients (16.67%). Compared with normal
      patients, the average exposure times, cumulative exposure time, BMI, Fever time, 
      white blood cell count, liver enzyme, LDH, myoenzyme and D-dimer were
      significantly increased in severe patients, while the lymphocyte count and
      albumin levels in peripheral blood were significantly decreased.Chest CT mainly
      showed patchy shadows and interstitial changes.According to imaging examination, 
      11 patients (36.67%) showed Unilateral pneumonia and 19 patients (63.33%) showed 
      bilateral pneumonia,4 patients (13.33%) showed bilateral multiple mottling and
      ground-glass opacity.Compared with the patients infected in the protected period,
      the proportion of severe infection and bilateral pneumonia were both increased in
      the patients infected in unprotected period. Conclusion: Medical staffs are at
      higher risk of infection.Infection rates are associated with contact time, the
      amount of suction virus. Severe patients had BMI increased, heating time
      prolonged, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer and albumin level
      significantly changed and were prone to be complicated with liver damage and
      myocardial damage.Strict protection measures is important to prevent infection
      for medical workers.

      49 years. 8 of these patients had no underlying disease and one suffered from
      diabetes. 7 patients had a history of travel to Wuhan City or Hubei Province, and
      one patient was a medical staff. Two family clustered was found. The incubation
      period was 1 to 6 days. The clinical manifestations were fever in 8 cases (8/9) ,
      dry cough in 5 cases (5/9) , pharyngalgia in 4 cases (4/9) , fatigue in 4 cases
      (4/9) , body soreness in 4 cases (4/9) , and blocked or watery nose in 1 case
      (1/9) . Six patients (6/9) had abnormal cell peripheral blood, of which 3 (3/9)
      had an increased monocyte count, 2 (2/9) had a reduced lymphocyte, and 1 (1/9)
      had an increased leukocyte count, while the 3 patients had normal cell blood
      routines. The median of CRP was 16.3 mg/L, including 5 patients with slightly
      elevated (5/9) , 4 patients with normal values (4/9) . the results of
      procalcitonin test were negative in5 patients. Three patients were examined by
      chest X-ray examination, one of which was normal, one case showed infiltrates of 
      right upper lung, and another showed in right lower lung. All patients underwent 
      chest HRCT. And 7 cases (7/9) showed multiple ground glass exudation, including 5
      cases (5/7) involved bilateral lungs, 2 cases (2/7) involved unilateral lung, 3
      cases (3/7) with patchy consolidation, and 2 cases (2/9) showed no abnormality.
      Conclusions: The patents with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in this study
      generally have an epidemiological history. The clinical manifestations are fever 
      and cough. Peripheral white blood cell counts were most normal And PCT were all
      negative. Chest HRCT manifested as multiple ground-glass opacities with partly
      consolidation. Some patients had normal chest radiographs but HRCT showed
      pneumonia. Some patients had no pneumonia on chest HRCT.

TI  - COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: estimating the epidemic
      potential and effectiveness of public health countermeasures.
LID - taaa030 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jtm/taaa030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces with
      relative homogeneous mixing. On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on
      cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an
      index case on board around 21-25 January. By 4 February, public health measures
      such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill
      passengers were implemented. By 20 February, 619 of 3,700 passengers and crew
      (17%) were tested positive. METHODS: We estimated the basic reproduction number
      from the initial period of the outbreak using (SEIR) models. We calibrated the
      models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We
      additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures,
      and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of
      differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an
      earlier versus later evacuation of the ship. RESULTS: The basic reproduction rate
      was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the ${R}_0$ in the epicentre in
      Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled
      initial ${R}_0$ of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the
      time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have
      been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and
      lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers
      on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their
      incubation time. CONCLUSIONS: The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an
      already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more
      than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions. However, evacuating all 
      passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more
      passengers and crew from infection.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0230548 [doi]
AB  - Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected
      pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for
      diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive
      patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image
      findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with
      mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women,
      with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered
      condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was
      higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). 
      The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival
      group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of
      ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and
      central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score
      of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12
      (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P =
      0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a 
      CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the
      prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with 
      chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground
      glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined
      peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly
      involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.

TI  - Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Surveillance and Containment Measures for the 
      First 100 Patients with COVID-19 in Singapore - January 2-February 29, 2020.
PG  - 307-311
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm6911e1 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in
      December 2019, and has since spread globally, resulting in >95,000 confirmed
      COVID-19 cases worldwide by March 5, 2020 (1). Singapore adopted a multipronged
      surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical
      consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19,
      enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with
      pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible
      infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and
      deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion
      (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case
      definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients. Containment measures,
      including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border
      controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize
      disease spread. As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been
      identified in Singapore. This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in 
      Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment
      measures. COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they
      were detected. Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 
      73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by
      laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion. Effectiveness of
      these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the
      interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which
      indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19
      cases. Rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts,
      and active monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing
      expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing 
      outbreaks.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified 
      on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting 
      in 6,284 cases including 42 deaths as of March 6, 2020. To examine the growth
      rate of the outbreak, we aimed to present the first study to report the
      reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS: The daily confirmed
      cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. 
      By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the
      generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on
      the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval. RESULTS: We 
      identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% 
      CI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95%
      CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI:
      0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case
      fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and
      increases with older age. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate early sustained
      transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social 
      distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread
      from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in
      12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one
      case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a
      country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of
      African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. METHODS: We used
      data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected
      provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per
      country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with
      two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations
      Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious
      Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese
      regions contributing most to their risk. FINDINGS: Countries with the highest
      importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high
      capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria,
      Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and
      high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same
      exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the
      city of Beijing, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Many countries in Africa are
      stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations.
      Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently
      prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect 
      imported cases and to limit onward transmission. FUNDING: EU Framework Programme

AB  - The new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), also named as COVID-19 by WHO on Feb 11
      2020, is now causing a severe public health emergency in China since. The number 
      of diagnosed cases is more than 40,000 until the submission of this manuscript.
      Coronavirus has caused several epidemic situations world widely, but the present 
      contagious disease caused by 2019 new coronavirus is unprecedentedly fulminating.
      The published cohorts of 2019 new coronavirus (n-Cov) are single-center studies, 
      or retrospective studies. We here share the therapeutic experiences of NCP
      treatment with literature review. Combination of Ribavirin and interferon-alpha
      is recommended by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised
      Edition) because of the effect on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and
      the effectiveness of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Remdisivir needs to be confirmed by 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), given the situation of no specific antivirus
      drug on NCP is unavailable. Systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended as a
      short term use (1~2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), 3~5 d) by the 5(th) edition National Health 
      Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) yet RCTs are expected to confirm the
      effectiveness. Inappropriate application of antibiotics should be avoided,
      especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics, for the NCP is not
      often complicated with bacterial infection.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several recent case reports have described common early chest
      imaging findings of lung pathology caused by 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV2)
      which appear to be similar to those seen previously in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
      infected patients. OBJECTIVE: We present some remarkable imaging findings of the 
      first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from
      Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included,
      showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS:
      Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing
      percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and
      multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up,
      apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary
      vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic 
      tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could
      be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration.
      Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with
      short-axis oval nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Although only two patients have been studied,
      these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in
      literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung
      infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor
      radiological sign of lung impairment.

AB  - We used the epidemic data of COVID-19 published on the official website of the
      municipal health commission in Anhui province. We mapped the spatiotemporal
      changes of confirmed cases, fitted the epidemic situation by the population
      growth curve at different stages and took statistical description and analysis of
      the epidemic situation in Anhui province. It was found that the cumulative
      incidence of COVID-19 was 156/100 000 by February 18, 2020 and the trend of
      COVID-19 epidemic declined after February 7, changing from J curve to S curve.
      The actual number of new cases began to decrease from February 2 to February 4
      due to the time of case report and actual onset delayed by 3 to 5 days.
