AB  - The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection caused pneumonia. we retrospectively 
      analyzed the virus presence in the pharyngeal swab, blood, and the anal swab
      detected by real-time PCR in the clinical lab. Unexpectedly, the 2109-nCoV RNA
      was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28
      patients). Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the
      blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation 
      of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of 
      the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage.
      However, the concentration of viral RNA in the anal swab (Ct value = 24 + 39) was
      higher than in the blood (Ct value = 34 + 39) from patient 2, suggesting that the
      virus might replicate in the digestive tract. Altogether, our results confirmed
      the presence of virus RNA in extra-pulmonary sites.

AB  - Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected
      pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for
      diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive
      patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image
      findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with
      mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women,
      with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered
      condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was
      higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). 
      The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival
      group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of
      ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and
      central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score
      of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12
      (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P =
      0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a 
      CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the
      prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with 
      chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground
      glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined
      peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly
      involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.
