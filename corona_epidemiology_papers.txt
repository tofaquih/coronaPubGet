AB  - World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The
      virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by
      the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with
      SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from
      asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, 
      which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides 
      an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just
      crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 
      largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery,
      zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
      in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with
      SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human 
      coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency
      viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a
      proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses,
      their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes.
      Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host
      antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are 
      also discussed.

AB  - Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia.
      We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% 
      high density interval: 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained
      human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar
      magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
      pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread.

AB  - In about 20 days since the diagnosis of the first case of the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Korea on January 20, 2020, 28 cases have been
      confirmed. Fifteen patients (53.6%) of them were male and median age of was 42
      years (range, 20-73). Of the confirmed cases, 16, 9, and 3 were index (57.2%),
      first-generation (32.1%), and second-generation (10.7%) cases, respectively. All 
      first-generation and second-generation patients were family members or intimate
      acquaintances of the index cases with close contacts. Fifteen among 16 index
      patients had entered Korea from January 19 to 24, 2020 while 1 patient had
      entered Korea on January 31, 2020. The average incubation period was 3.9 days
      (median, 3.0), and the reproduction number was estimated as 0.48. Three of the
      confirmed patients were asymptomatic when they were diagnosed. Epidemiological
      indicators will be revised with the availability of additional data in the
      future. Sharing epidemiological information among researchers worldwide is
      essential for efficient preparation and response in tackling this new infectious 
      disease.

AB  - As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed
      outside China. We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe from affected
      areas in China via air travel. We consider travel restrictions in place, three
      reported cases in France, one in Germany. Estimated risk in Europe remains high. 
      The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk. Importation from
      Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe.

AB  - Unexplained pneumonia (UP) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) emerged in China in late December 2019 and
      has infected more than 9000 cases by 31 January 2020. Shanghai reported the first
      imported case of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) in 20 January 2020. A
      combinative approach of real-time RT-PCR, CRISPR-based assay and metagenomic
      next-generation sequencing (mNGS) were used to diagnose this unexplained
      pneumonia patient. Real-time RT-PCR and CRISPR-based assay both reported
      positive. This sample belonged to Betacoronavirus and shared a more than 99%
      nucleotide (nt) identity with the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We further compared 
      pros and cons of common molecular diagnostics in UP. In this study, we
      illustrated the importance of combining molecular diagnostics to rule out common 
      pathogens and performed mNGS to obtain unbiased potential pathogen result for the
      diagnosis of UP.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan,
      China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that
      2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia,
      thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this
      disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection 
      from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through
      oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients
      also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted
      investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. 
      We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal
      swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting
      shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route. We also showed
      serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future
      epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed
      through multiple routes.

AB  - From December 2019, an outbreak of unusual pneumonia was reported in Wuhan with
      many cases linked to Huanan Seafood Market that sells seafood as well as live
      exotic animals. We investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory
      syndromes after independent contact history with this market. The two patients
      shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground-glass
      opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. Here, we
      highlight the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS)
      approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It rapidly
      identified a novel coronavirus (named 2019-nCoV according to World Health
      Organization announcement) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very
      high abundance level (1.5% and 0.62% of total RNA sequenced). The entire viral
      genome is 29,881 nt in length (GenBank MN988668 and MN988669, Sequence Read
      Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736) and is classified into
      beta-coronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that 2019-nCoV is close
      to coronaviruses (CoVs) circulating in Rhinolophus (Horseshoe bats), such as
      98.7% nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene of bat coronavirus strain
      BtCoV/4991 (GenBank KP876546, 370 nt sequence of RdRp and lack of other genome
      sequence) and 87.9% nucleotide identity to bat coronavirus strain bat-SL-CoVZC45 
      and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S, and N genes also
      suggests 2019-nCoV is more likely a novel CoV independently introduced from
      animals to humans.

TI  - Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Now is the time to refresh
      pandemic plans.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - This article outlines practical steps that businesses can take now to prepare for
      a pandemic. Given the current growing spread of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) around the world, it is imperative that businesses review their
      pandemic plans and be prepared in case this epidemic expands and affects more
      people and communities. Preparing for a potential infectious disease pandemic
      from influenza or a novel corona virus is an essential component of a business
      continuity plan, especially for businesses that provide critical healthcare and
      infrastructure services. Although many businesses and organisations have a
      pandemic plan or address pandemic preparedness in their business continuity
      plans, few have recently tested and updated their plans. Pandemics can not only
      interrupt an organisation's operations and compromise long-term viability of an
      enterprise, but also disrupt the provision of critical functions. Businesses that
      regularly test and update their pandemic plan can significantly reduce harmful
      impacts to the business, play a key role in protecting employees' and customers' 
      health and safety, and limit the negative impact of a pandemic on the community
      and economy.

      originating in Wuhan, China.

LID - 10.12688/f1000research.22211.2 [doi]
AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential 
      respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused
      on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak
      could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.
      While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy
      to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help
      these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential
      options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for
      speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. 
      I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal
      antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome,
      emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for
      the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any 
      mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that
      blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain,
      providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, 
      while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The
      sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its
      possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug
      today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are
      later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a
      protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to
      year(s).

TI  - First two months of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) epidemic in China:
      real-time surveillance and evaluation with a second derivative model.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s41256-020-00137-4 [doi]
AB  - Background: Similar to outbreaks of many other infectious diseases, success in
      controlling the novel 2019 coronavirus infection requires a timely and accurate
      monitoring of the epidemic, particularly during its early period with rather
      limited data while the need for information increases explosively. Methods: In
      this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus
      epidemic in China with cumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months.
      The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population
      assumption. This model was built with the data and used to assess the detection
      rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true
      infections, detectable and detected cases. Results: Results from the second
      derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus epidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in 
      nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to
      massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indicated by results from
      both second derivative and exponential modeling analyses. The epidemic started to
      decelerate immediately after the massive actions. The results derived from our
      analysis signaled the decline of the epidemic 14 days before it eventually
      occurred on February 4, 2020. Study findings further signaled an accelerated
      decline in the epidemic starting in 14 days on February 18, 2020. Conclusions:
      The coronavirus epidemic appeared to be nonlinear and chaotic, and was responsive
      to effective interventions. The methods used in this study can be applied in
      surveillance to inform and encourage the general public, public health
      professionals, clinicians and decision-makers to take coordinative and
      collaborative efforts to control the epidemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, China is currently
      recognized as a public health emergency of global concern. METHODS: We reviewed
      the currently available literature to provide up-to-date guidance on control
      measures to be implemented by public health authorities. RESULTS: Some of the
      epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV have been identified. However, there
      remain considerable uncertainties, which should be considered when providing
      guidance to public health authorities on control measures. CONCLUSIONS:
      Additional studies incorporating more detailed information from confirmed cases
      would be valuable.

AB  - A novel type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infecting humans appeared in Wuhan,
      China, at the end of December 2019. Since the identification of the outbreak the 
      infection quickly spread involving in one month more than 31,000 confirmed cases 
      with 638 death. Molecular analysis suggest that 2019-nCoV could be originated
      from bats after passaging in intermediate hosts, highlighting the high zoonotic
      potential of coronaviruses.

AB  - The new coronavirus outbreak gets everyone's attention. China's national actions 
      against the outbreak have contributed great contributions to the world. China has
      been learning from practice for better reporting and is fast to adapt itself. In 
      this article we discuss China's practice in public reporting and its implications
      to global health. Confirmed cases, dynamic suspected cases, recovered cases, and 
      deaths have been reported both in accumulative numbers and their daily updates.
      Some ratio indictors reporting (fatality rate, recovery rate, etc.), trend
      reporting, and global surveillance have been applied as well. Some improvements
      can still be made. It is necessary to further explore the influential factors
      behind the indicators for interventions. Recommendations are made to the World
      Health Organization and other countries for better public reporting and
      surveillance.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged 
      recently in Wuhan, China. Information on reported cases strongly indicates
      human-to-human spread, and the most recent information is increasingly indicative
      of sustained human-to-human transmission. While the overall severity profile
      among cases may change as more mild cases are identified, we estimate a risk of
      fatality among hospitalised cases at 14% (95% confidence interval: 3.9-32%).

AB  - An outbreak of COVID-19 developed aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during

      describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we
      characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the
      outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting
      reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from 
      community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 
      1.1-7). Our findings suggest that R t decreased substantially compared to values 
      during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced
      quarantine control. Most recent estimates of R t reached values largely below the
      epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus
      was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.

AB  - Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected
      pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for
      diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive
      patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image
      findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with
      mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women,
      with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered
      condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was
      higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). 
      The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival
      group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of
      ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and
      central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score
      of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12
      (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P =
      0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a 
      CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the
      prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with 
      chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground
      glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined
      peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly
      involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.
