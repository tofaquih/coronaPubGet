AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;
      previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease
      (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is 
      a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health
      Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been
      identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China.
      On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health
      emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two
      bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 
      and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or 
      direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period
      of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with
      pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), 
      fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement 
      with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography
      images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is
      responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China.
      Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the
      primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep
      monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus
      and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

AB  - In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and
      later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and
      rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world,
      despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the 
      original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic
      information systems and methods, including, among other application
      possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of
      social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using
      population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and
      contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and
      effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and
      describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and
      applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated
      events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications
      are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of
      them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had
      any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support
      the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.

      transmission into Africa and South America.

AB  - Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last
      week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27
      countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was 
      to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air
      flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou)
      to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated
      passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, 
      an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the 
      direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of
      2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination
      countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city
      reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on 
      the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st
      quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were
      destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The 
      risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the 
      WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, 
      of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia
      (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of
      the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 
      1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV
      transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which
      reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy;
      in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of
      them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of
      transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil
      showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the
      countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31
      January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe
      (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and 
      Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition,
      isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening,
      public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of 
      further spread to naive countries.

AB  - There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and 
      spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was
      transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei
      province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date
      (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected
      droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are
      usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others.
      The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with
      comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case
      fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration
      of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common
      laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated
      C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually
      abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially
      supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails
      home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict
      infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet
      precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. 
      The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.

PG  - 3-8

AB  - On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced an outbreak
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), China is now at 
      a critical period in the control of the epidemic. The Chinese Government has been
      taking a series of rapid, comprehensive, and effective prevention and control
      measures. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a
      serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage 
      of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing.
      This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention
      and control. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to
      quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and 
      it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the
      emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and
      there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency
      medical supplies. A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the 
      management of public health emergencies. Based on international experiences with 
      pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency
      reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public
      health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of
      international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies
      of international concern in the future.

AB  - An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2,
      previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
      spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020,
      World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a
      public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2,
      since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third
      introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the
      human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of
      87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of
      China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several
      independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to
      beta-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to
      bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads
      through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed
      sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the 
      globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue
      and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. 
      The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and 
      prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific
      antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed 
      drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest
      research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics
      of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to
      combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2)
      causing a cluster of respiratory infections (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) 
      in Wuhan, China, was identified on 7 January 2020. The epidemic quickly
      disseminated from Wuhan and as at 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been
      confirmed in 25 countries, including 1,116 deaths. Strengthened surveillance was 
      implemented in France on 10 January 2020 in order to identify imported cases
      early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of risk exposure and
      follow-up procedure were defined for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were
      confirmed on 24 January, the first cases in Europe. Contact tracing was
      immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as at low risk of exposure
      and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been
      discharged and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no 
      secondary transmission has been identified. Effective collaboration between all
      parties involved in the surveillance and response to emerging threats is required
      to detect imported cases early and to implement adequate control measures.

AB  - World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The
      virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by
      the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with
      SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from
      asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, 
      which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides 
      an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just
      crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 
      largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery,
      zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
      in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with
      SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human 
      coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency
      viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a
      proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses,
      their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes.
      Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host
      antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are 
      also discussed.

TI  - Rigidity of the Outer Shell Predicted by a Protein Intrinsic Disorder Model Sheds
      Light on the COVID-19 (Wuhan-2019-nCoV) Infectivity.
LID - E331 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom10020331 [doi]
AB  - The world is currently witnessing an outbreak of a new coronavirus spreading
      quickly across China and affecting at least 24 other countries. With almost
      65,000 infected, a worldwide death toll of at least 1370 (as of 14 February
      2020), and with the potential to affect up to two-thirds of the world population,
      COVID-19 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global
      health emergency. The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as 
      Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494
      laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002-2003
      epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases.
      Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral
      infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their
      transmissibility. It is likely that these differences in infectivity of
      coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their
      shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic 
      disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of
      an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, now named COVID-19. Most cases and
      sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been
      reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy. Since the symptoms are
      similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers
      arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common 
      infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.

AB  - In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, identified a cluster of
      pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology linked to the city's South China Seafood
      Market. Subsequent investigations revealed a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as
      the causative agent now at the heart of a major outbreak. The rising case numbers
      have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action, including the
      wholesale isolation of Wuhan. Alongside this has been a robust scientific
      response, including early publication of the pathogen genome, and rapid
      development of highly specific diagnostics. This article will review the new
      knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 acute respiratory disease, and summarise its
      clinical features.

AB  - As of 28 February 2020, Italy had 888 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with most
      cases in Northern Italy in the Lombardia and Veneto regions. Travel-related cases
      were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current
      epidemic in Italy. The month of February, however, has been dominated by two
      large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local 
      transmission the source of infections. Contact tracing has failed to identify
      patient zero in one of the outbreaks. As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of
      COVID-19 have died. Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are
      identical at 2.3. Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with
      fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities. It will be important
      to develop point-of-care devices to aid clinicians in stratifying elderly
      patients as early as possible to determine the potential level of care they will 
      require to improve their chances of survival from COVID-19 disease.

AB  - In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei
      Province; and then named "2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)" by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced
      respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it
      attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the
      request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV
      infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be
      developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice
      guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also
      added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
      This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological
      characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis,
      treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial
      infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover,
      we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe
      2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for
      2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first
      frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections,
      community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person 
      who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.

      Disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 [previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus]
      in the first 42 days after announcement of a cluster of pneumonia in China, on 31
      December 2019 (day 1) in Hong Kong. METHODS: A bundle approach of active and
      enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid
      molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers (HCWs)
      with unprotected exposure in the hospitals was implemented. Epidemiological
      characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental and air samples were collected 
      and analyzed. RESULTS: From day 1 to day 42, forty-two (3.3%) of 1275 patients
      fulfilling active (n=29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n=13) confirmed to
      have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The number of locally acquired case significantly
      increased from 1 (7.7%) of 13 [day 22 to day 32] to 27 (93.1%) of 29 confirmed
      case [day 33 to day 42] (p<0.001). Twenty-eight patients (66.6%) came from 8
      family clusters. Eleven (2.7%) of 413 HCWs caring these confirmed cases were
      found to have unprotected exposure requiring quarantine for 14 days. None of them
      was infected and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed.
      Environmental surveillance performed in a patient with viral load of 3.3x106
      copies/ml (pooled nasopharyngeal/ throat swab) and 5.9x106 copies/ml (saliva)
      respectively. SARS-CoV-2 revealed in 1 (7.7%) of 13 environmental samples, but
      not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from patient's chin with or
      without wearing a surgical mask. CONCLUSION: Appropriate hospital infection
      control measures could prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical
      pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The 
      first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019.
      Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to
      bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500
      laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV,
      infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been
      confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including
      Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United
      States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has
      also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one
      provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of
      infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is 
      now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been
      infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions
      that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission?
      What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the
      vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection
      against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the
      generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in
      gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic
      development. Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV). METHODS: Based on the
      susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption 
      that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are
      resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic
      reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and
      suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by
      other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned
      from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: The basic
      reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on
      the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall
      between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from
      international colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: The early transmission ability of
      2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease 
      with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak
      of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China,
      which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention
      around the world. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral
      drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the
      novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate
      their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential 
      drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and
      therapeutic countermeasures. Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features,
      including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention
      and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.

AB  - The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan,
      Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to
      China's public health and clinical treatment. The virus belongs to the beta genus
      Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and 
      MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through 
      droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period
      could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current
      observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger
      transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related 
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor 
      SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot
      of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents,
      identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may
      inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of
      2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic
      coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and 
      control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia that
      started in Wuhan, China. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88
      confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we 
      estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval:
      5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These
      values should help inform 2019-nCoV case definitions and appropriate quarantine
      durations.

AB  - Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia.
      We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% 
      high density interval: 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained
      human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar
      magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
      pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and
      reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health
      concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and 
      clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      data on the global outbreak of "2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV" were obtained 
      from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
      (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the
      information from research documents published in global scientific journals
      indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological 
      and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS:
      Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916
      (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27
      states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April
      2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly
      the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 
      (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The
      fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) 
      and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison
      to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has
      diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious
      than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period
      compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was
      higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in
      coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills,
      cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea,
      confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take
      immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging
      pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.

      China, as of March 2, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was
      89,069 cases in 67 countries and regions. As of 0 am, March 2, 2020, the Republic
      of Korea had the second-largest number of confirmed cases (n = 4,212) after China
      (n = 80,026). This report summarizes the epidemiologic features and the snapshots
      of the outbreak in the Republic of Korea from January 19 and March 2, 2020.

AB  - We report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in travellers from
      Wuhan, China to Thailand. Both were independent introductions on separate
      flights, discovered with thermoscanners and confirmed with RT-PCR and genome
      sequencing. Both cases do not seem directly linked to the Huanan Seafood Market
      in Hubei but the viral genomes are identical to four other sequences from Wuhan, 
      suggesting early spread within the city already in the first week of January.

      2020. We detail the first European cases. As at 21 February, nine European
      countries reported 47 cases. Among 38 cases studied, 21 were linked to two
      clusters in Germany and France, 14 were infected in China. Median case age was 42
      years; 25 were male. Late detection of the clusters' index cases delayed
      isolation of further local cases. As at 5 March, there were 4,250 cases.

AB  - In about 20 days since the diagnosis of the first case of the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Korea on January 20, 2020, 28 cases have been
      confirmed. Fifteen patients (53.6%) of them were male and median age of was 42
      years (range, 20-73). Of the confirmed cases, 16, 9, and 3 were index (57.2%),
      first-generation (32.1%), and second-generation (10.7%) cases, respectively. All 
      first-generation and second-generation patients were family members or intimate
      acquaintances of the index cases with close contacts. Fifteen among 16 index
      patients had entered Korea from January 19 to 24, 2020 while 1 patient had
      entered Korea on January 31, 2020. The average incubation period was 3.9 days
      (median, 3.0), and the reproduction number was estimated as 0.48. Three of the
      confirmed patients were asymptomatic when they were diagnosed. Epidemiological
      indicators will be revised with the availability of additional data in the
      future. Sharing epidemiological information among researchers worldwide is
      essential for efficient preparation and response in tackling this new infectious 
      disease.

TI  - Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from (Wuhan) Coronavirus 2019-nCoV
      Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus
      Infections.
LID - E194 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v12020194 [doi]
AB  - In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was
      identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of
      China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a
      newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV. The infection moved rapidly
      through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries
      through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple
      countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing
      the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from
      human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is
      estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in
      special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus 
      infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have 
      become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the
      potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity 
      and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published
      data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other
      coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are
      also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials,
      and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.

AB  - The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) from the Hubei province in China in late 2019 demonstrates the
      epidemic potential of coronaviruses. The rapid spread of this virus across the
      world in only 2 months highlights the transmissibility of this family of viruses 
      and the significant morbidity and mortality that they can cause. We highlight the
      current state of knowledge of coronavirus biology while answering questions
      concerning the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed
      outside China. We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe from affected
      areas in China via air travel. We consider travel restrictions in place, three
      reported cases in France, one in Germany. Estimated risk in Europe remains high. 
      The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk. Importation from
      Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe.

AB  - The 2019-nCoV infection that is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus was first
      detected in China in the end of December 2019 and declared a public health
      emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on January
      30, 2020. Community pharmacists in one of the first areas that had confirmed
      cases of the viral infection, Macau, joined the collaborative force in supporting
      the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements. This paper
      aimed to improve the understanding of community pharmacists' role in case of
      2019-CoV outbreak based on the practical experiences in consultation with the
      recommendations made by the International Pharmaceutical Federation on the
      Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak.

      SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

AB  - After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world
      in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause
      severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV
      isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the
      Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes
      acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as "coronavirus
      disease 2019" (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused
      widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are 
      some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features
      between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal
      of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and
      SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and 
      treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.

AB  - BackgroundThe chest CT findings of patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have not previously been described in detail.PurposeTo
      investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV 
      pneumonia in humans.Materials and MethodsFifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women;
      age range 16-76 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using
      real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section 
      CT. The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were
      evaluated.ResultsFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with
      individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and
      cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal
      white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and
      either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count. CT
      images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO 
      with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. 
      GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure
      consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%)
      patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the
      posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more
      consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT
      scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P < .001).
      Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those
      aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P < .001). Follow-up CT in 13
      patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%)
      patients.ConclusionPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous
      ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, 
      combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic
      exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      pneumonia.(c) RSNA, 2020.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 
      novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should 
      be contained to prevent the global spread. The COVID-19 virus was known earlier
      as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths
      related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and
      epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has 
      a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino
      acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the
      regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although
      several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal
      reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has
      similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for
      COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that
      of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid
      sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross
      react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to
      SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the
      RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense. This mini-review aims at
      investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.

TI  - In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of
      Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
LID - ciaa237 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine
      has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine
      shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety
      profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.
      We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be
      useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill
      SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use 
      of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological
      activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2
      infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were
      implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using
      the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated
      under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst
      considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72
      muM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 muM) in vitro. Based
      on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg
      given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it
      reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice 
      daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more
      potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

AB  - In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported
      in Wuhan, China. A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious
      pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus. This causative virus has been
      temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic
      is spreading in China and all over the world now. The purpose of this review is
      primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of 
      COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on 
      the current evidences. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

      Coronavirus.
PG  - 184-190
LID - 10.5811/westjem.2020.1.46760 [doi]
AB  - 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely
      related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei
      Province, China in December 2019. As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are
      continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the
      United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high
      volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the
      2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of
      infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, 
      all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it
      is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be
      able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated.
      The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial
      detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious
      agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a 
      modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of
      patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms
      and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure
      to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a
      risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected
      persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the
      appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 3I Tool will assist
      emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in
      effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.

TI  - Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and
      control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a
      scoping review.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s40249-020-00646-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause
      of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning
      in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries
      with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization 
      has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A
      scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by 
      Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published
      before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the
      epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus.
      The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors'
      affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis.
      All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based
      on published information as listed in the references. RESULTS: Most of the
      publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest
      proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority
      (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused
      on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to
      prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination
      is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations
      have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue,
      pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such 
      as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection,
      contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce
      transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective;
      hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive
      care. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the
      outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily
      explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well 
      as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are
      relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is
      needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health
      emergency in both the short- and long-term.

TI  - A mathematical model for simulating the phase-based transmissibility of a novel
      coronavirus.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown
      etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee 
      on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a
      mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. METHODS: In
      this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model
      for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be 
      bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to 
      explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan
      Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as
      Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix
      approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) from the RP 
      model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The value of R0 
      was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person
      which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from
      introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population
      was 3.58. CONCLUSIONS: Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2
      was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East
      countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in
      the Republic of Korea.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease with a rapid increase 
      in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December
      2019. Limited data are available about COVID-19 during pregnancy; however,
      information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses
      (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory
      syndrome (MERS)) might provide insights into COVID-19's effects during pregnancy.

      (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community
      transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is
      becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible

      transmission' phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation
      phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.

      December 2019 is a highly contagious disease. The World Health Organization (WHO)
      has declared the ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency. Currently,
      the research on novel coronavirus is still in the primary stage. Based on the
      current published evidence, we systematically summarizes the epidemiology,
      clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of knowledge
      surrounding COVID-19. This review in the hope of helping the public effectively
      recognize and deal with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and providing a

      (2019-nCoV) in China, from 2019 to 2020: A data-driven analysis in the early
      phase of the outbreak.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit
      a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other
      provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic
      reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.
      METHODS: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate,
      we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China 
      from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the
      estimated intrinsic growth rate (gamma), we estimated R0 by using the serial
      intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as
      approximations for the true unknown SI. FINDINGS: The early outbreak data largely
      follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24
      (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold
      increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate
      substantially affect estimates of R0. CONCLUSION: The mean estimate of R0 for the
      2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1. Our
      findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.

TI  - Identifying and Interrupting Superspreading Events-Implications for Control of
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.
LID - 10.3201/eid2606.200495 [doi]
AB  - It appears inevitable that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will
      continue to spread. Although we still have limited information on the
      epidemiology of this virus, there have been multiple reports of superspreading
      events (SSEs), which are associated with both explosive growth early in an
      outbreak and sustained transmission in later stages. Although SSEs appear to be
      difficult to predict and therefore difficult to prevent, core public health
      actions can prevent and reduce the number and impact of SSEs. To prevent and
      control of SSEs, speed is essential. Prevention and mitigation of SSEs depends,
      first and foremost, on quickly recognizing and understanding these events,
      particularly within healthcare settings. Better understanding transmission
      dynamics associated with SSEs, identifying and mitigating high-risk settings,
      strict adherence to healthcare infection prevention and control measures, and
      timely implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions can help prevent and
      control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, as well as future
      infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - Since December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases have been reported
      in Wuhan, China. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
      temporarily named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On 11
      February 2020, the WHO officially named the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV as
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading all over the
      world, especially in China. Based on the published evidence, we systematically
      discuss the characteristics of COVID-19 in the hope of providing a reference for 
      future studies and help for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19
      (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV),
      which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including
      66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased
      pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this
      stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk
      assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should
      include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the
      investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical 
      manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of
      coronavirus.

AB  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle
      East since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, 
      a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province,
      China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the
      etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with
      international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid
      national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative
      strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee
      to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern
      (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV
      community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge 
      for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of
      standardized and approved point of care testing. This challenge will now be faced
      by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since both
      coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those patients should now be tested for 
      both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the continuing wide
      international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14
      days will be of less significance.

AB  - Switzerland is among the countries with the highest number of coronavirus
      disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases per capita in the world. There are likely many
      people with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection because testing efforts are currently
      not detecting all infected people, including some with clinical disease
      compatible with COVID-19. Testing on its own will not stop the spread of
      SARS-CoV-2. Testing is part of a strategy. The World Health Organization
      recommends a combination of measures: rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of 
      cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts. In
      this article, we explain why the testing strategy in Switzerland should be
      strengthened urgently, as a core component of a combination approach to control
      COVID-19.

AB  - To help health workers and the public recognize and deal with the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) quickly, effectively, and calmly with an updated
      understanding. A comprehensive search from Chinese and worldwide official
      websites and announcements was performed between 1 December 2019 and 9:30 am 26
      January 2020 (Beijing time). A latest summary of 2019-nCoV and the current
      outbreak was drawn. Up to 24 pm, 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases of
      2019-nCoV infection were confirmed in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths
      having occurred. The latest mortality was approximately 2.84% with a total of
      2684 cases still suspected. The China National Health Commission reported the
      details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm, 22 January 2020. The deaths included 
      13 males and 4 females. The median age of the people who died was 75 (range
      48-89) years. Fever (64.7%) and cough (52.9%) were the most common first symptoms
      among those who died. The median number of days from the occurence of the first
      symptom to death was 14.0 (range 6-41) days, and it tended to be shorter among
      people aged 70 years or more (11.5 [range 6-19] days) than those aged less than
      70 years (20 [range 10-41] days; P = .033). The 2019-nCoV infection is spreading 
      and its incidence is increasing nationwide. The first deaths occurred mostly in
      elderly people, among whom the disease might progress faster. The public should
      still be cautious in dealing with the virus and pay more attention to protecting 
      the elderly people from the virus.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread
      rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 100,000 confirmed infections and
      4000 fatalities (as of 10 March 2020). The outbreak has been declared a pandemic 
      by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in
      transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine
      diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic
      coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for
      SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of
      different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show 
      that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate
      regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021.
      Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation
      in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the 
      scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might
      be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but
      do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2
      should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global
      transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection
      control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave
      with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of
      opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.

AB  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle
      East since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, 
      a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province,
      China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the
      etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with
      international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid
      national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative
      strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee
      to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern
      (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV
      community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge 
      for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of
      standardized and approved point of care testing. This challenge will now be faced
      by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since both
      coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those patients should now be tested for 
      both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the continuing wide
      international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14
      days will be of less significance.

AB  - Unexplained pneumonia (UP) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) emerged in China in late December 2019 and
      has infected more than 9000 cases by 31 January 2020. Shanghai reported the first
      imported case of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) in 20 January 2020. A
      combinative approach of real-time RT-PCR, CRISPR-based assay and metagenomic
      next-generation sequencing (mNGS) were used to diagnose this unexplained
      pneumonia patient. Real-time RT-PCR and CRISPR-based assay both reported
      positive. This sample belonged to Betacoronavirus and shared a more than 99%
      nucleotide (nt) identity with the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We further compared 
      pros and cons of common molecular diagnostics in UP. In this study, we
      illustrated the importance of combining molecular diagnostics to rule out common 
      pathogens and performed mNGS to obtain unbiased potential pathogen result for the
      diagnosis of UP.

TI  - Applications of google search trends for risk communication in infectious disease
      management: A case study of COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan.
LID - S1201-9712(20)30140-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An emerging outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected in at least 26
      countries worldwide. Given this pandemic situation, robust risk communication is 
      urgently needed particularly in affected countries. Therefore, this study
      explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor public restlessness
      toward COVID-19 epidemic infection in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrieved GT data for
      the specific locations of Taiwan nationwide and subregions using defined search
      terms related to coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks. RESULTS: Searches
      related to COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan increased rapidly, following the
      announcements of Taiwan' first imported case and reached its peak as local cases 
      were reported. However, searches for handwashing were gradually increased in
      period of face masks shortage. Moreover, high to moderate correlations between
      Google relative search volume (RSV) and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei
      (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), Tainan (lag-1), Taichung (lag0),
      and Kaohsiung (lag0). CONCLUSION: In response to the ongoing outbreak, our
      results demonstrated that GT could potentially define the proper timing and
      location for practicing appropriate risk communication strategies to the affected
      population.

AB  - World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The
      virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by
      the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with
      SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from
      asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, 
      which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides 
      an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just
      crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 
      largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery,
      zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
      in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with
      SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human 
      coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency
      viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a
      proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses,
      their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes.
      Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host
      antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are 
      also discussed.

AB  - There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19
      (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV),
      which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including
      66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased
      pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this
      stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk
      assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should
      include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the
      investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical 
      manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of
      coronavirus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have
      generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial
      clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients
      with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included
      confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of
      follow-up was February 25, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the
      median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset
      of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was
      occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been
      discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of
      fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals
      [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to
      intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared
      to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P
      <0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%)
      patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed
      radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative
      reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days
      (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients
      in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis,
      age (Odds ratio [OR]=1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR=0.55 per 100 cells/ul
      increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The
      majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests
      that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy 
      in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.

AB  - In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported
      in Wuhan, China. A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious
      pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus. This causative virus has been
      temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic
      is spreading in China and all over the world now. The purpose of this review is
      primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of 
      COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on 
      the current evidences. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

AB  - An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2,
      previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
      spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020,
      World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a
      public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2,
      since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third
      introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the
      human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of
      87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of
      China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several
      independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to
      beta-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to
      bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads
      through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed
      sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the 
      globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue
      and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. 
      The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and 
      prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific
      antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed 
      drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest
      research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics
      of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to
      combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.

AB  - To determine the epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a
      remote region of China, far from Wuhan, we analyzed the epidemiology of COVID-19 
      in Gansu Province. From January 23 through February 3, 2020, a total of 35
      (64.8%) of 54 reported cases were imported from COVID-19-epidemic areas.
      Characteristics that differed significantly during the first and second waves of 
      illness in Gansu Province were mean patient age, occupation, having visited
      epidemic areas, and mode of transportation. Time from infection to illness onset 
      for family clusters was shorter in Gansu Province than in Wuhan, consistent with 
      shortened durations from onset to first medical visit or hospitalization. Spatial
      distribution pattern analysis indicated hot spots and spatial outliers in Gansu
      Province. As a result of adequate interventions, transmission of the COVID-19
      virus in Gansu Province is decreasing.

TI  - Initial clinical features of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 in two emergency 
      departments outside of Hubei, China.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25763 [doi]
AB  - With an increasing number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases outside of
      Hubei, emergency departments (EDs) and fever clinics are facing challenges posed 
      by the large number of admissions of patients suspected to have COVID-19.
      Therefore, it is of crucial importance to study the initial clinical features of 
      patients, to better differentiate between infected and uninfected patients
      outside Hubei. A total of 116 patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented
      to two emergency departments in Anhui for the first time between 24 January 2020 
      and 20 February 2020 were enrolled in the study. The initial clinical data of
      these patients, such as epidemiological features, symptoms, laboratory results,
      and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were collected using a standard case 
      report form on admission. Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; the
      remaining 84 patients were referred to as negative cases. The median age of the
      diagnosed patients was 46 years, but only 35 years for negative cases. History of
      exposure to Wuhan or COVID-19 patients in the previous 2 weeks was observed in
      63% of the diagnosed and 44% of negative cases. Median time from illness onset to
      ED admission was 5 days for all patients, diagnosed patients, and negative cases,
      respectively. Fever was observed in 27 (84%) and 57 (68%) diagnosed and negative 
      cases, respectively. Nineteen (59%) diagnosed and 24 (29%) negative cases had
      lymphopenia on admission in ED. A chest CT scan on admission revealed the
      presence of pneumonia in the majority of the diagnosed patients (30 out of 32,
      94%) and in 56 (67%) negative cases. Bilateral involvement and ground-glass
      opacity (GGO) were present in 91% and 47% of the diagnosed patients. Thirty-two
      patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; the remaining 84 patients were referred to
      as negative cases. The median age of the diagnosed patients was 46 years, but
      only 35 years for negative cases. History of exposure to Wuhan or COVID-19

TI  - The potential chemical structure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25761 [doi]
AB  - An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan and it has
      rapidly spread to almost all parts of the world. For coronaviruses, RNA-dependent
      RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important protease that catalyzes the replication of 
      RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we 
      screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds
      proven to show antiviral activity in severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the similar chemical structures through a molecular
      docking study to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score
      in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), SARS-CoV (-8.03
      kcal/mol), and MERS-CoV (-8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we
      discovered that theaflavin has lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it
      docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking
      server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute
      significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between
      theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one pi-cation interaction was formed between
      theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server. Our results suggest that
      theaflavin could be a potential SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor for further study.

AB  - There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and 
      spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was
      transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei
      province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date
      (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected
      droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are
      usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others.
      The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with
      comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case
      fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration
      of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common
      laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated
      C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually
      abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially
      supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails
      home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict
      infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet
      precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. 
      The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.

AB  - Thousands of people in the United States have required testing for SARS-CoV-2.
      Evaluation for a special pathogen is resource intensive. We report an innovative 
      approach to home assessment that, in collaboration with public health, enables
      safe evaluation and specimen collection outside the healthcare setting, avoiding 
      unnecessary exposures and resource utilization.

      reporting?
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/s41256-020-00140-9 [doi]
AB  - The new coronavirus outbreak gets everyone's attention. China's national actions 
      against the outbreak have contributed great contributions to the world. China has
      been learning from practice for better reporting and is fast to adapt itself. In 
      this article we discuss China's practice in public reporting and its implications
      to global health. Confirmed cases, dynamic suspected cases, recovered cases, and 
      deaths have been reported both in accumulative numbers and their daily updates.
      Some ratio indictors reporting (fatality rate, recovery rate, etc.), trend
      reporting, and global surveillance have been applied as well. Some improvements
      can still be made. It is necessary to further explore the influential factors
      behind the indicators for interventions. Recommendations are made to the World
      Health Organization and other countries for better public reporting and
      surveillance.

AB  - Objective: To summarize and analyze the clinical and imaging characteristics of
      patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in the early stage in Beijing.
      Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data of 9 patients with
      2019 novel coronavirus infection diagnosed in one fever clinicic in Beijing from 
      January 18, 2020 to February 3, 2020. Results: 5 male and 4 female was included
      in those 9 patients, whose median age was 36 years, and the age range from 15 to 
      49 years. 8 of these patients had no underlying disease and one suffered from
      diabetes. 7 patients had a history of travel to Wuhan City or Hubei Province, and
      one patient was a medical staff. Two family clustered was found. The incubation
      period was 1 to 6 days. The clinical manifestations were fever in 8 cases (8/9) ,
      dry cough in 5 cases (5/9) , pharyngalgia in 4 cases (4/9) , fatigue in 4 cases
      (4/9) , body soreness in 4 cases (4/9) , and blocked or watery nose in 1 case
      (1/9) . Six patients (6/9) had abnormal cell peripheral blood, of which 3 (3/9)
      had an increased monocyte count, 2 (2/9) had a reduced lymphocyte, and 1 (1/9)
      had an increased leukocyte count, while the 3 patients had normal cell blood
      routines. The median of CRP was 16.3 mg/L, including 5 patients with slightly
      elevated (5/9) , 4 patients with normal values (4/9) . the results of
      procalcitonin test were negative in5 patients. Three patients were examined by
      chest X-ray examination, one of which was normal, one case showed infiltrates of 
      right upper lung, and another showed in right lower lung. All patients underwent 
      chest HRCT. And 7 cases (7/9) showed multiple ground glass exudation, including 5
      cases (5/7) involved bilateral lungs, 2 cases (2/7) involved unilateral lung, 3
      cases (3/7) with patchy consolidation, and 2 cases (2/9) showed no abnormality.
      Conclusions: The patents with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in this study
      generally have an epidemiological history. The clinical manifestations are fever 
      and cough. Peripheral white blood cell counts were most normal And PCT were all
      negative. Chest HRCT manifested as multiple ground-glass opacities with partly
      consolidation. Some patients had normal chest radiographs but HRCT showed
      pneumonia. Some patients had no pneumonia on chest HRCT.

AB  - In December 2019, the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, 
      attracting attention worldwidely. The novel coronavirus has the characteristics
      of rapid transmission, atypical clinical symptoms, and easy to affect both lungs,
      leading to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis, as well as difficult to detection
      and assessment at early stage. Fever, cough, myalgia, weakness, dyspnea and
      imagings may be helpful for the early detection of novel coronavirus pneumonia.
      At the same time, the rate of disease progression, fever, CT manifestations,
      hypoxia degree, age, basic diseases, and laboratory indicators can also be used
      to evaluate the severity of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.

      became a pandemic in over a month. Government and medical institutions across the
      country mobilized all kinds of resources and took a variety of measures to
      actively treat patients and stop the epidemic. Based on current studies, the
      author summarized the clinical characteristics and evolution of the novel viral
      pneumonia, and proposed the key points of diagnosis and treatment, the scientific
      management of both confirmed and suspected cases, and the scientific management
      of disease prevention and control.

TI  - Estimating the reproductive number and the outbreak size of Novel Coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19) using mathematical model in Republic of Korea.
PG  - e2020011
LID - 10.4178/epih.e2020011 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Since the first novel coronavirus disease(COVID-19) patient was
      diagnosed on 20-Jan, about 30 patients were diagnosed in Korea until 17-Feb.
      However, 5,298 more patient were confirmed until 4-Mar. The purpose is to
      estimate and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures using mathematical
      modeling. Methods: Deterministic mathematical model(SEIHR) has been established
      to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of confirmed patients in Daegu and North 
      Gyeongsang Province(Daegu/NGP), the main area of outbreak, were used. The first
      patient's symptom onset date was assumed on 22-Jan. We estimate the reproduction 
      number(R), and the effect of preventive measures, assuming that the effect has
      been shown from 29-Feb. or 5-Mar. Results: The estimated R in Hubei Province was 
      4.2655, while the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.5555, but later in
      Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.4721 and 3.5428. When the transmission period 
      decreases from 4 days to 2 days, the outbreak finished early, but the peak of the
      epidemic has increased, and the total number of patients has not changed much. If
      transmission rate decreases about 90% or 99%, the outbreak finished early, and
      the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreased. Conclusion:
      To early end of the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus 
      such as social distancing and mask wearing are absolutely crucial with the
      participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission
      period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through efforts
      by the quarantine authorities.

AB  - The new decade of the 21(st) century (2020) started with the emergence of novel
      coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 that caused an epidemic of coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. It is the third highly pathogenic and transmissible
      coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in humans. The
      source of origin, transmission to humans and mechanisms associated with the
      pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 are not clear yet, however, its resemblance with
      SARS-CoV and several other bat coronaviruses was recently confirmed through
      genome sequencing related studies. The development of therapeutic strategies is
      necessary in order to prevent further epidemics and cure infected people. In this
      Review, we summarize current information about the emergence, origin, diversity, 
      and epidemiology of three pathogenic coronaviruses with a specific focus on the
      current outbreak in Wuhan, China. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical features
      and potential therapeutic options that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Now is the time to refresh
      pandemic plans.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - This article outlines practical steps that businesses can take now to prepare for
      a pandemic. Given the current growing spread of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) around the world, it is imperative that businesses review their
      pandemic plans and be prepared in case this epidemic expands and affects more
      people and communities. Preparing for a potential infectious disease pandemic
      from influenza or a novel corona virus is an essential component of a business
      continuity plan, especially for businesses that provide critical healthcare and
      infrastructure services. Although many businesses and organisations have a
      pandemic plan or address pandemic preparedness in their business continuity
      plans, few have recently tested and updated their plans. Pandemics can not only
      interrupt an organisation's operations and compromise long-term viability of an
      enterprise, but also disrupt the provision of critical functions. Businesses that
      regularly test and update their pandemic plan can significantly reduce harmful
      impacts to the business, play a key role in protecting employees' and customers' 
      health and safety, and limit the negative impact of a pandemic on the community
      and economy.

      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic and associated events
      around the world: how 21st century GIS technologies are supporting the global
      fight against outbreaks and epidemics.

AB  - In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and
      later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and
      rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world,
      despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the 
      original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic
      information systems and methods, including, among other application
      possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of
      social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using
      population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and
      contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and
      effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and
      describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and
      applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated
      events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications
      are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of
      them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had
      any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support
      the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.

TI  - Identification of coronavirus sequences in carp cDNA from Wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25751 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus sequences were
      identified in two separate complementary DNA (cDNA) pools. The first pool was
      from a Carassius auratus (crusian carp) cell line and the second was from
      Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp) head kidney tissue. BLAST analysis suggests 
      that these sequences belong to SARS-like coronaviruses, and that they are not
      evolutionarily conserved in other species. Investigation of the submitting
      laboratories revealed that two laboratories from the Institute of Hydrobiology at
      the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan, China performed the research and
      submitted the cDNA libraries to GenBank. This institution is very close in
      proximity to the Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market where SARS-CoV-2
      first amplified in the human population. It is possible that these sequences are 
      an artifact of the bioinformatics pipeline that was used. It is also possible
      that SARS-like coronaviruses are a common environmental pathogen in the region
      that may be in aquatic habitats.

TI  - First two months of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) epidemic in China:
      real-time surveillance and evaluation with a second derivative model.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s41256-020-00137-4 [doi]
AB  - Background: Similar to outbreaks of many other infectious diseases, success in
      controlling the novel 2019 coronavirus infection requires a timely and accurate
      monitoring of the epidemic, particularly during its early period with rather
      limited data while the need for information increases explosively. Methods: In
      this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus
      epidemic in China with cumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months.
      The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population
      assumption. This model was built with the data and used to assess the detection
      rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true
      infections, detectable and detected cases. Results: Results from the second
      derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus epidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in 
      nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to
      massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indicated by results from
      both second derivative and exponential modeling analyses. The epidemic started to
      decelerate immediately after the massive actions. The results derived from our
      analysis signaled the decline of the epidemic 14 days before it eventually
      occurred on February 4, 2020. Study findings further signaled an accelerated
      decline in the epidemic starting in 14 days on February 18, 2020. Conclusions:
      The coronavirus epidemic appeared to be nonlinear and chaotic, and was responsive
      to effective interventions. The methods used in this study can be applied in
      surveillance to inform and encourage the general public, public health
      professionals, clinicians and decision-makers to take coordinative and
      collaborative efforts to control the epidemic.

      (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community
      transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is
      becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible

      transmission' phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation
      phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.

TI  - Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage
      of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population 
      in China.
LID - E1729 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17051729 [doi]
AB  - Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health
      emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological
      resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to
      reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the
      epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to
      better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and 
      stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used
      for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted
      an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected 
      information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact
      history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary
      measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to
      COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised 
      (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and
      Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194
      cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of
      the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive 
      symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported
      moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home 
      (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%);
      and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).
      Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia,
      dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly
      associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels 
      of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate
      health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular
      precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with 
      a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety,
      and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 
      outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological
      impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe
      anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of
      psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to
      formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable 
      groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.

TI  - In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of
      Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
LID - ciaa237 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine
      has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine
      shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety
      profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.
      We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be
      useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill
      SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use 
      of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological
      activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2
      infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were
      implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using
      the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated
      under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst
      considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72
      muM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 muM) in vitro. Based
      on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg
      given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it
      reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice 
      daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more
      potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

AB  - In the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease, investigating,
      classifying, tracking, and managing contacts by identifying the patient's route
      are important for preventing further transmission of the disease. However,
      omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is
      performed through only a proxy interview with the patient. To overcome these
      limitations, methods that can objectively verify the patient's claims (medical
      facility records, Global Positioning System, card transactions, and
      closed-circuit television) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease
      2019 contact investigations in South Korea.

      Disease in South Korea.
PG  - 8-14
LID - 10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.1.03 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
      South Korea was reported in January 2020, with 28 confirmed cases reported as of 
      February 14(th), 2020. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28
      cases were analyzed in response to this disease. Methods: The epidemiological
      characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with
      confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data
      and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response
      team. Results: There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: 
      Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients),
      Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient). The early symptoms were fever, sore 
      throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache. Three patients were 
      asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia. Of the 28 cases, 16 were index
      cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in
      Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients.
      The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family
      members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of
      transmission were mostly at home. Conclusion: COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 
      infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation
      cases. The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at 
      this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home. Establishing an
      early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of
      the disease.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of 24 asymptomatic infections with COVID-19 screened
      among close contacts in Nanjing, China.

AB  - Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019
      novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person
      transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study 
      aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic
      infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of 
      asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were
      conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients)
      in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic
      and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for
      the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples.
      Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed.
      As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms
      while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever,
      cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical
      CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the
      lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms
      during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years;
      P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia 
      or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first
      day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests,
      was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through
      epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to
      the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
      Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to
      be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be
      up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness.
      These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and
      longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation
      recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the
      patients discharged.

AB  - As of 28 February 2020, Italy had 888 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with most
      cases in Northern Italy in the Lombardia and Veneto regions. Travel-related cases
      were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current
      epidemic in Italy. The month of February, however, has been dominated by two
      large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local 
      transmission the source of infections. Contact tracing has failed to identify
      patient zero in one of the outbreaks. As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of
      COVID-19 have died. Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are
      identical at 2.3. Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with
      fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities. It will be important
      to develop point-of-care devices to aid clinicians in stratifying elderly
      patients as early as possible to determine the potential level of care they will 
      require to improve their chances of survival from COVID-19 disease.

AB  - The 'Healing the Schism: Epidemiology, Medicine, and the Public's Health' by
      professor Kerr L. White's be published has a history of nearly 30 years. Since
      then, although scholars have appealed to incorporating public health and clinical
      medicine education, and breaking down separations between public health and
      clinical workforce in China, the effect is yet not so obvious. The outbreak of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has opened a public class on the treatment,
      prevention and control of infectious diseases for the Chinese citizens.
      Consequently, the Chinese people have higher expectations on the modernization of
      public health governance, and the social atmosphere of incorporating preventive
      medicine and clinical medical education is establishing. In future, when
      combating with novel infectious diseases and public health emergencies, the
      response capacity of public health system and treatment capacity of clinical
      system will be significantly improved, while the situation on insufficient
      integration of prevention and treatment is bound to be reversed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from
      information on 28 infector-infectee pairs. METHODS: We collected dates of illness
      onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from
      published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively
      ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full
      dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n =
      18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is
      still in its growth phase. RESULTS: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing
      all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible
      interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the 
      median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).
      CONCLUSIONS: The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its
      median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of
      secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial
      interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory
      syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval
      may introduce bias.

AB  - The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is named COVID-19. 
      This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly
      elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state.
      This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following
      SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are
      associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present
      with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is
      currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild
      animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and
      pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of
      CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated
      from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing
      off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were
      instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much 
      of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While
      these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster 
      along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier
      implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons 
      learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence
      and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an
      effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges.
      The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has
      led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally.
      Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians
      being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.

AB  - After the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, we estimated the
      distribution and scale of more than 5 million migrants residing in Wuhan after
      they returned to their hometown communities in Hubei Province or other provinces 
      at the end of 2019 by using the data from the 2013-2018 China Migrants Dynamic
      Survey (CMDS). We found that the distribution of Wuhan's migrants is centred in
      Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in
      the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of
      circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan's migrants, whose origins in Hubei
      Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province,
      and account for 66% of Wuhan's total migrants, are from the surrounding
      prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and
      counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts
      and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan's migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged
      and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family
      migration (84%), migration with families of 3-4 members (71%), a rural household 
      registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for
      migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size 
      of Wuhan's migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed
      cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and
      found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei
      Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has 
      increased rapidly. The results are conducive to monitoring the epidemic
      prevention and control in various regions.

AB  - On 31 December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness was reported from
      China and later confirmed as novel coronavirus on 7 January 2020. This virus is
      the same member of the coronavirus family that caused the severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) reported in China 2003, and Middle East
      respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The initial
      cases have been linked to a live seafood market in Wuhan, China, and the specific
      animal source is yet to be determined. The detection of this new virus in humans 
      without knowing the source of the infection has raised greatly heightened
      concerns not only in China, but also internationally. To date, the outbreak has
      spread to most provinces in China and 25 other countries within a relatively
      short period. Consequent to its spread, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director General
      of the World Health Organization (WHO), declared the outbreak a Public Health
      Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and
      reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health
      concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and 
      clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      data on the global outbreak of "2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV" were obtained 
      from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
      (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the
      information from research documents published in global scientific journals
      indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological 
      and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS:
      Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916
      (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27
      states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April
      2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly
      the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 
      (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The
      fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) 
      and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison
      to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has
      diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious
      than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period
      compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was
      higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in
      coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills,
      cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea,
      confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take
      immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging
      pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 
      novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should 
      be contained to prevent the global spread. The COVID-19 virus was known earlier
      as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths
      related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and
      epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has 
      a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino
      acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the
      regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although
      several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal
      reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has
      similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for
      COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that
      of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid
      sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross
      react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to
      SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the
      RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense. This mini-review aims at
      investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.

AB  - In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, identified a cluster of
      pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology linked to the city's South China Seafood
      Market. Subsequent investigations revealed a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as
      the causative agent now at the heart of a major outbreak. The rising case numbers
      have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action, including the
      wholesale isolation of Wuhan. Alongside this has been a robust scientific
      response, including early publication of the pathogen genome, and rapid
      development of highly specific diagnostics. This article will review the new
      knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 acute respiratory disease, and summarise its
      clinical features.

TI  - The 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak - A Global Threat.
PG  - 67-71
AB  - The 2019 Novel Corona virus infection (COVID 19) is an ongoing public health
      emergency of international significance. There are significant knowledge gaps in 
      the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management. In
      this article, we review the available evidence about this disease. Every decade
      has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three
      decades. The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and
      spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. There is a
      spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with
      major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic 
      shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in
      appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor
      prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging,
      Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions 
      like Hypertension and age >60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis is confirmed with 
      PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily
      supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under
      investigation. Role of steroids is still inconclusive. Standard infection control
      and prevention techniques should be followed. Vigilant screening of suspected
      cases and their contacts is important. Isolation of symptomatic cases and home
      quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended. To conclude, controlling this
      highly transmissible disease requires international co-ordination.

LID - E1633 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17051633 [doi]
AB  - Within last 17 years two widespread epidemics of severe acute respiratory
      syndrome (SARS) occurred in China, which were caused by related coronaviruses
      (CoVs): SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Although the origin(s) of these viruses are
      still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general
      patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable. Both viruses utilize
      the same receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-for invading human
      bodies. Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major 
      holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a
      fashion. Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and 
      low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for 
      prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats. The widespread 
      existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in 
      breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more
      vulnerable. Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of
      the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday
      travel. These natural and social factors influenced the general progression and
      trajectory of the SARS epidemiology. However, some unique factors might also
      contribute to the origination of SARS in Wuhan. These factors are discussed in
      different scenarios in order to promote more research for achieving final
      validation.

AB  - In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by
      the virus SARS-CoV-2, began in Wuhan, China (1). The disease spread widely in
      China, and, as of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been identified in 36
      other countries and territories, including the United States. Person-to-person
      transmission has been widely documented, and a limited number of countries have
      reported sustained person-to-person spread.* On January 20, state and local
      health departments in the United States, in collaboration with teams deployed
      from CDC, began identifying and monitoring all persons considered to have had
      close contact(dagger) with patients with confirmed COVID-19 (2). The aims of
      these efforts were to ensure rapid evaluation and care of patients, limit further
      transmission, and better understand risk factors for transmission.

AB  - In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as
      the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a
      formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including
      Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our
      country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named
      as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also
      named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan 
      CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth
      category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate
      (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through
      droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection
      control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may
      jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, there is no definite
      treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly
      identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of
      the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.

PG  - E008
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn112152-20200303-00166 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To investigate the principles of differential diagnosis of pulmonary
      infiltrates in cancer patients during the outbreak of novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) by analyzing one case of lymphoma who presented pulmonary
      ground-glass opacities (GGO) after courses of chemotherapy. Methods: Baseline
      demographics and clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved
      from medical records. Information of clinical manifestations, history of
      epidemiology, lab tests and chest CT scan images of visiting patients from
      February 13 to February 28 were collected. Literatures about pulmonary
      infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from databases including PUBMED,
      EMBASE and CNKI. Results: Among the 139 cancer patients underwent chest CT scans 
      before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified in eight patients
      (5.8%), five of whom were characterized as GGOs in lungs. 2019-nCoV nuclear acid 
      testing was performed in three patients and the results were negative. One case
      was a 66-year-old man diagnosed as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent CHOP
      chemotherapy regimen. His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs in lungs
      and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes. This patient denied
      any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection and without
      fever and other respiratory symptoms. Considering the negative result of nuclear 
      acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed as viral pneumonia and an 
      experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. Conclusions:
      The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario
      of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients. The epidemic history, clinical
      manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be combined consideration. The
      2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applicated in more selected patients.
      Active anti-infection treatment and surveillance of patient condition should be
      initiated if infectious disease is considered.

PG  - 485-488

AB  - Objective: As the prevention and control of COVID-19continues to advance, the
      active nucleic acid test screening in the close contacts of the patients has been
      carrying out in many parts of China. However, the false-positive rate of positive
      results in the screening has not been reported up to now. But to clearify the
      false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and
      prevention. Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which
      impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the
      information available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive
      results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and
      multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the 
      robustness of the findings. Results: When the infection rate of the close
      contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as
      the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was
      only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%.
      The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the
      base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of
      positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19
      patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals'
      reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives.

TI  - Escalating infection control response to the rapidly evolving epidemiology of the
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong.
PG  - 1-24
LID - 10.1017/ice.2020.58 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To describe the infection control preparedness for Coronavirus
      Disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 [previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus]
      in the first 42 days after announcement of a cluster of pneumonia in China, on 31
      December 2019 (day 1) in Hong Kong. METHODS: A bundle approach of active and
      enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid
      molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers (HCWs)
      with unprotected exposure in the hospitals was implemented. Epidemiological
      characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental and air samples were collected 
      and analyzed. RESULTS: From day 1 to day 42, forty-two (3.3%) of 1275 patients
      fulfilling active (n=29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n=13) confirmed to
      have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The number of locally acquired case significantly
      increased from 1 (7.7%) of 13 [day 22 to day 32] to 27 (93.1%) of 29 confirmed
      case [day 33 to day 42] (p<0.001). Twenty-eight patients (66.6%) came from 8
      family clusters. Eleven (2.7%) of 413 HCWs caring these confirmed cases were
      found to have unprotected exposure requiring quarantine for 14 days. None of them
      was infected and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed.
      Environmental surveillance performed in a patient with viral load of 3.3x106
      copies/ml (pooled nasopharyngeal/ throat swab) and 5.9x106 copies/ml (saliva)
      respectively. SARS-CoV-2 revealed in 1 (7.7%) of 13 environmental samples, but
      not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from patient's chin with or
      without wearing a surgical mask. CONCLUSION: Appropriate hospital infection
      control measures could prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Deja Vu or Jamais Vu? How the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Experience
      Influenced a Singapore Radiology Department's Response to the Coronavirus Disease
      (COVID-19) Epidemic.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.22927 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. This article shares the ground operational perspective of how a
      tertiary hospital radiology department in Singapore is responding to the
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. This same department was also deeply
      impacted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003.
      CONCLUSION. Though similar to SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has several
      differences. We share how lessons from 2003 are applied and modified in our
      ongoing operational response to this evolving novel pathogen.

AB  - We report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in travellers from
      Wuhan, China to Thailand. Both were independent introductions on separate
      flights, discovered with thermoscanners and confirmed with RT-PCR and genome
      sequencing. Both cases do not seem directly linked to the Huanan Seafood Market
      in Hubei but the viral genomes are identical to four other sequences from Wuhan, 
      suggesting early spread within the city already in the first week of January.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of
      an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, now named COVID-19. Most cases and
      sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been
      reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy. Since the symptoms are
      similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers
      arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common 
      infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.

LID - 10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30074-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks
      of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics
      of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess
      if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from
      imported cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We developed a stochastic transmission
      model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the 
      potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling 
      a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We 
      considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic
      reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the
      probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that
      occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We
      assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were
      deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in
      total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and
      contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to
      measure feasibility of public health effort. FINDINGS: Simulated outbreaks
      starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1.5, and 0% transmission before
      symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability;
      however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of 
      initial cases, when R0 was 2.5 or 3.5 and with more transmission before symptom
      onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with 
      an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully
      traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2.5 more than 70% of
      contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3.5 more than 90% of contacts had to 
      be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in 
      determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1.5. For R0 values
      of 2.5 or 3.5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were
      only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before
      symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: In most scenarios, highly effective contact
      tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within
      3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom
      onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing
      transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated
      transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to
      assess the potential success of local response efforts. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust,

AB  - Objective: To study the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan
      Province. Methods: An epidemiological study was conducted based on the latest
      epidemic information of 1,265 confirmed cases (including regional distribution,
      severe illness, and deaths) announced by Health Commission of Henan Province, as 
      well as the details of 1,079 COVID-19 officially released by Health Commission of
      municipalities in Henan Province collected as of 24:00 on February 19, 2020.
      Results: Among 1 079 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, there were 573 male
      (53.2%) and 505 female (46.8%) , with the ratio of male to female of 1.14:1; The 
      majority of patients were 36-59 years old (553 cases, 51.3%) , and the mean age
      was 46 (interquartile range is 24) years old; 515 cases (47.7%) had a history of 
      living, traveling, doing business in Wuhan or a brief stopover at Wuhan train
      stop, and 382 (35.4%) had a history of close contact with confirmed patients;
      There were 72 severe cases (5.7%) in 1 265 patients, and the fatality rate was
      1.5%. A high number of cases were reported in Xinyang (269 cases, 21.26%) ,
      Zhengzhou (156 cases, 12.33%) , Nanyang (155 cases, 12.25%) , Zhumadian (139
      cases, 10.99%) , followed by Shangqiu (91 cases, 7.19%) , Zhoukou (76 cases,
      6.01%) . Among 605 patients, the symptoms were fever (553 cases, 91.4%) ,
      debilitation (44 cases, 7.3%) , cough (110 cases, 18.2%) , expectoration (19
      cases, 3.1%) , chills (6 cases, 1.0%) , shiver (7 cases, 1.2%) , running nose (21
      cases, 3.5%) , stuffy noses (8 cases, 1.3%) , throat dryness and sore (24 cases, 
      4.0%) , headache (21 cases, 3.5%) , chest pain (6 cases, 1.0%) , anhelation (18
      cases, 3.0%) , and gastrointestinal symptom (21 cases, 3.5%) . The age of deaths 
      ranged from 33 to 86 years old, with an average age of 72 (interquartile range of
      17) years old; there be 7 males (63.6%) and 4 females (36.4%) . Conclusion: The
      cases in Henan Province were mainly imported cases and had certain geographical
      location relevance; meanwhile, there was a family-focused incidence. The overall 
      trend of new cases was wave-like decline, and the number of deaths was high among
      elderly men with underlying diseases.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations,
      treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019 novel
      coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection in children from six provinces (autonomous
      region) in northern China. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the
      epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest
      imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was
      conducted. The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February
      21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces(autonomous region) of
      Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31
      children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years).
      Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with
      confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees 
      from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases.
      The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases
      (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed. The
      most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9
      cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9
      days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for </=3 d, while in other 5 cases lasted
      > 3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) and diarrhea
      (n=3, 9%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. 
      In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2
      cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet
      count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30),
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate(19%,4/21), procalcitonin(4%,1/28), liver
      enzyme(22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different
      proportions. Renal function and blood glucose were normal. There were abnormal
      chest CT changes in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass
      opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the
      pleural area. After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned
      negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered
      and were discharged from hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case
      series, 2019-nCoV infections in children from six provinces (autonomous region)
      in northern China are mainly caused by close family contact. Clinical types are
      asymptomatic, mild and common types. Clinical manifestations and laboratory
      examination results are nonspecific. Close contact history of epidemiology,
      nucleic acid detection and chest imaging are important bases for diagnosis. After
      general treatment, the short-term prognosis is good.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential 
      respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused
      on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak
      could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.
      While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy
      to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help
      these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential
      options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for
      speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. 
      I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal
      antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome,
      emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for
      the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any 
      mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that
      blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain,
      providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, 
      while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The
      sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its
      possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug
      today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are
      later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a
      protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to
      year(s).

AB  - An outbreak of respiratory illness proved to be infected by a 2019 novel
      coronavirus, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was notified
      first in Wuhan, China, and has spread rapidly in China and to other parts of the 
      world. Herein, we reported the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus
      pneumonia (NCP) imported from China in Taiwan. This case report revealed a
      natural course of NCP with self-recovery, which may be a good example in
      comparison with medical treatments.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the
      causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public
      health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to
      the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely
      the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19
      infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a 
      variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission
      of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special
      attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in
      susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly
      people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission,
      pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread
      of this fatal disease.

AB  - Objectives: Fitting and forecasting the trend of COVID-19 epidemics. Methods:
      Based on SEIR dynamic model, considering the COVID-19 transmission mechanism,
      infection spectrum and prevention and control procedures, we developed SEIR(+
      CAQ) dynamic model to fit the frequencies of laboratory confirmed cases obtained 
      from the government official websites. The data from January 20, 2020 to February
      7, 2020 were used to fit the model, while the left data between February 8-12
      were used to evaluate the quality of forecasting. Results: According to the
      cumulative number of confirmed cases between January 29 to February 7, the
      fitting bias of SEIR(+ CAQ) model for overall China (except for cases of Hubei
      province), Hubei province (except for cases of Wuhan city) and Wuhan city was
      less than 5%. For the data of subsequent 5 days between February 8 to 12, which
      were not included in the model fitting, the prediction biases were less than 10%.
      Regardless of the cases diagnosed by clinical examines, the numbers of daily
      emerging cases of China (Hubei province not included), Hubei Province (Wuhan city
      not included) and Wuhan city reached the peak in the early February. Under the
      current strength of prevention and control, the total number of laboratory-
      confirmed cases in overall China will reach 80 417 till February 29, 2020,
      respectively. Conclusions: The proposed SEIR(+ CAQ) dynamic model fits and
      forecasts the trend of novel coronavirus pneumonia well and provides evidence for
      decision making.

AB  - Objective: To study the early dynamics of the epidemic of coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) in China from 15 to 31 January, 2020, and estimate the corresponding
      epidemiological parameters (incubation period, generation interval and basic
      reproduction number) of the epidemic. Methods: By means of Weibull, Gamma and
      Lognormal distributions methods, we estimated the probability distribution of the
      incubation period and generation interval data obtained from the reported
      COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the AIC criterion was used to determine the optimal
      distribution. Considering the epidemic is ongoing, the exponential growth model
      was used to fit the incidence data of COVID-19 from 10 to 31 January, 2020, and
      exponential growth method, maximum likelihood method and SEIR model were used to 
      estimate the basic reproduction number. Results: Early COVID-19 cases kept an
      increase in exponential growth manner before 26 January, 2020, then the increase 
      trend became slower. The average incubation period was 5.01 (95%CI: 4.31-5.69)
      days; the average generation interval was 6.03 (95%CI: 5.20-6.91) days. The basic
      reproduction number was estimated to be 3.74 (95%CI: 3.63-3.87), 3.16 (95%CI:
      2.90-3.43), and 3.91 (95%CI: 3.71-4.11) by three methods, respectively.
      Conclusions: The Gamma distribution fits both the generation interval and
      incubation period best, and the mean value of generation interval is 1.02 day
      longer than that of incubation period. The relatively high basic reproduction
      number indicates that the epidemic is still serious; Based on our analysis, the
      turning point of the epidemic would be seen on 26 January, the growth rate would 
      be lower afterwards.

      coronavirus.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown
      etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee 
      on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a
      mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. METHODS: In
      this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model
      for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be 
      bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to 
      explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan
      Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as
      Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix
      approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) from the RP 
      model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The value of R0 
      was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person
      which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from
      introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population
      was 3.58. CONCLUSIONS: Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2
      was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East
      countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in
      the Republic of Korea.

TI  - Potential Rapid Diagnostics, Vaccine and Therapeutics for 2019 Novel Coronavirus 
      (2019-nCoV): A Systematic Review.
LID - E623 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9030623 [doi]
AB  - Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the 
      management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to
      systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for
      Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their
      prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was
      carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane
      Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary
      strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total
      of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for
      confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit
      developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and 
      likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits
      have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine
      candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a
      synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as
      therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy
      against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV 
      and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against
      2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug 
      combinations supported by high-level evidence.

AB  - A novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV, hit the central Chinese city of
      Wuhan in late December 2019, and subsequently spread rapidly to all provinces of 
      China and multiple countries. As of 0:00 am February 9, 2020, a total of 37,287
      cases have been confirmed infection of 2019-nCoV in China mainland, and 302 cases
      have also been cumulatively reported from 24 countries. According to the latest
      data, a total of 813 deaths occurred in China mainland, with the mortality
      reaching approximately 2.2%. At present, there is no vaccine or specific drugs
      for the human coronavirus. Therefore, it is critical to understand the nature of 
      the virus and its clinical characteristics, in order to respond to the 2019-nCoV 
      outbreak. Thus, the present study briefly but comprehensively summarizes the not 
      much but timely reports on the 2019-nCoV.

TI  - COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: estimating the epidemic
      potential and effectiveness of public health countermeasures.
LID - taaa030 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jtm/taaa030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces with
      relative homogeneous mixing. On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on
      cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an
      index case on board around 21-25 January. By 4 February, public health measures
      such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill
      passengers were implemented. By 20 February, 619 of 3,700 passengers and crew
      (17%) were tested positive. METHODS: We estimated the basic reproduction number
      from the initial period of the outbreak using (SEIR) models. We calibrated the
      models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We
      additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures,
      and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of
      differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an
      earlier versus later evacuation of the ship. RESULTS: The basic reproduction rate
      was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the ${R}_0$ in the epicentre in
      Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled
      initial ${R}_0$ of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the
      time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have
      been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and
      lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers
      on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their
      incubation time. CONCLUSIONS: The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an
      already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more
      than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions. However, evacuating all 
      passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more
      passengers and crew from infection.

AB  - We used the epidemic data of COVID-19 published on the official website of the
      municipal health commission in Anhui province. We mapped the spatiotemporal
      changes of confirmed cases, fitted the epidemic situation by the population
      growth curve at different stages and took statistical description and analysis of
      the epidemic situation in Anhui province. It was found that the cumulative
      incidence of COVID-19 was 156/100 000 by February 18, 2020 and the trend of
      COVID-19 epidemic declined after February 7, changing from J curve to S curve.
      The actual number of new cases began to decrease from February 2 to February 4
      due to the time of case report and actual onset delayed by 3 to 5 days.

AB  - An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, 
      and has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories,
      including the United States (1). As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936
      reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland
      China (1). There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been
      reported in the United States. Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United
      States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from
      high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States.
      This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local
      health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are
      implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United
      States. These measures require the identification of cases and contacts of
      persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment,
      monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19
      transmission. Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission
      of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the
      spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health
      departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the 
      general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better
      characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development 
      and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics,
      and vaccines. U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation
      closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO)
      and other global partners. Interim guidance is available at
      https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html. As more is learned about this novel
      virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance
      for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and
      communities.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease with a rapid increase 
      in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December
      2019. Limited data are available about COVID-19 during pregnancy; however,
      information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses
      (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory
      syndrome (MERS)) might provide insights into COVID-19's effects during pregnancy.

PG  - 1-21
AB  - Prior to the global outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were
      the only coronaviruses known to infect humans. Following the SARS outbreak, 5
      additional coronaviruses have been discovered in humans, most recently the novel 
      coronavirus COVID-19, believed to have originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
      China. SARS-CoV and MERSCoV are particularly pathogenic in humans and are
      associated with high mortality. In this review, the epidemiology,
      pathophysiology, and management of the recently discovered COVID-19 are reviewed,
      with a focus on best practices and the public health implications.

AB  - An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China since
      December 2019 has led to 31,516 infected persons and 638 deaths across 25
      countries (till 16:00 on February 7, 2020). The virus causing this pneumonia was 
      then named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health
      Organization. To promote the data sharing and make all relevant information of
      2019-nCoV publicly available, we construct the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource
      (2019nCoVR, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). 2019nCoVR features comprehensive
      integration of genomic and proteomic sequences as well as their metadata
      information from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, National
      Center for Biotechnology Information, China National GeneBank, National
      Microbiology Data Center and China National Center for Bioinformation
      (CNCB)/National Genomics Data Center (NGDC). It also incorporates a wide range of
      relevant information including scientific literatures, news, and popular articles
      for science dissemination, and provides visualization functionalities for genome 
      variation analysis results based on all collected 2019-nCoV strains. Moreover, by
      linking seamlessly with related databases in CNCB/NGDC, 2019nCoVR offers virus
      data submission and sharing services for raw sequence reads and assembled
      sequences. In this report, we provide comprehensive descriptions on data
      deposition, management, release and utility in 2019nCoVR, laying important
      foundations in aid of studies on virus classification and origin, genome
      variation and evolution, fast detection, drug development and pneumonia precision
      prevention and therapy.

TI  - Passengers' destinations from China: low risk of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      transmission into Africa and South America.
PG  - e41
LID - 10.1017/S0950268820000424 [doi]
AB  - Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last
      week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27
      countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was 
      to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air
      flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou)
      to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated
      passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, 
      an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the 
      direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of
      2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination
      countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city
      reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on 
      the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st
      quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were
      destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The 
      risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the 
      WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, 
      of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia
      (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of
      the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 
      1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV
      transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which
      reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy;
      in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of
      them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of
      transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil
      showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the
      countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31
      January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe
      (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and 
      Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition,
      isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening,
      public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of 
      further spread to naive countries.

LID - 10.3390/v12020244 [doi]
AB  - After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world
      in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause
      severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV
      isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the
      Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes
      acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as "coronavirus
      disease 2019" (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused
      widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are 
      some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features
      between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal
      of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and
      SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and 
      treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having
      COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial
      importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the
      early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship.
      METHOD: We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with
      a gamma distribution and applied "earlyR" package in R to estimate the R0 in the 
      early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied "projections" package in R to
      simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily
      incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval
      distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that
      daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily
      infectiousness. RESULTS: The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for
      COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06-2.52) estimated by the bootstrap
      resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would
      gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514
      (1384-1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by
      25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to
      1081 (981-1177) and 758 (697-817), respectively. CONCLUSION: The median with 95% 
      CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06-2.52) during the early stage
      experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and
      probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict
      infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential
      of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship.

AB  - Since December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases have been reported
      in Wuhan, China. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
      temporarily named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On 11
      February 2020, the WHO officially named the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV as
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading all over the
      world, especially in China. Based on the published evidence, we systematically
      discuss the characteristics of COVID-19 in the hope of providing a reference for 
      future studies and help for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - The current epidemic situation of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) still
      remained severe. As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious
      Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine
      is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the
      present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National
      Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and
      established an effective treatment strategy centered on "Four-Anti and
      Two-Balance" for clinical practice. The "Four-Anti and Two-Balance"strategy
      included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and
      maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological
      balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was
      recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical
      detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was
      emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest
      positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10%
      patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR
      results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces,
      indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was
      necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial
      liver blood purification system. The "Four-Anti and
      Two-Balance"strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early 
      antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness
      progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed
      antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine
      storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove
      inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe
      balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy 
      in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of
      moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 
      mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen
      therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients
      with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster
      ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis 
      should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with 
      long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT),
      meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with
      COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as
      Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function
      should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of
      prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal
      microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial
      translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore,
      we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also
      integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation
      through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized
      nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained 
      unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, 
      two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular
      following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have
      been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19
      was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of
      prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.

TI  - Rigidity of the Outer Shell Predicted by a Protein Intrinsic Disorder Model Sheds
      Light on the COVID-19 (Wuhan-2019-nCoV) Infectivity.

AB  - The world is currently witnessing an outbreak of a new coronavirus spreading
      quickly across China and affecting at least 24 other countries. With almost
      65,000 infected, a worldwide death toll of at least 1370 (as of 14 February
      2020), and with the potential to affect up to two-thirds of the world population,
      COVID-19 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global
      health emergency. The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as 
      Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494
      laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002-2003
      epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases.
      Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral
      infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their
      transmissibility. It is likely that these differences in infectivity of
      coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their
      shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic 
      disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.

AB  - One of the most perplexing questions regarding the current COVID-19 coronavirus
      epidemic is the discrepancy between the severity of cases observed in the Hubei
      province of China and those occurring elsewhere in the world. One possible answer
      is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to
      other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained
      inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been
      documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to
      similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a 
      possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and
      deaths.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan,
      China. Since then, this highly contagious COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide, 
      with a rapid rise in the number of deaths. Novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia
      (NCIP) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. A variety of
      chest imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types 
      of coronavirus syndromes. The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss
      the known epidemiology and the imaging findings of coronavirus syndromes, with a 
      focus on the reported imaging findings of NCIP. Moreover, the authors review
      precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel to manage
      patients with known or suspected NCIP. Implementation of a robust plan in the
      radiology department is required to prevent further transmission of the virus to 
      patients and department staff members.

TI  - Estimated effectiveness of symptom and risk screening to prevent the spread of
      COVID-19.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.55570 [doi]
LID - e55570 [pii]
AB  - Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following
      its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the
      global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand
      factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of
      emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of
      different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history
      and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate
      that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the
      factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases
      missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet
      developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the
      need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being
      missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy
      to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future
      emerging pathogens.

AB  - On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical
      pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The 
      first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019.
      Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to
      bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500
      laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV,
      infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been
      confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including
      Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United
      States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has
      also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one
      provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of
      infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is 
      now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been
      infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions
      that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission?
      What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the
      vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection
      against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the
      generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in
      gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic
      development. Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at

AB  - Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than
      forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese
      government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made
      the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak,
      the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where 
      the 2019-nCoV had originated-Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten
      days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant
      difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other
      provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic
      restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial 
      support and improved research ability, along with network communication
      technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention
      measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective
      treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in
      policy formulation-public health experts, the government, and the general public.
      It was also aided by media and information technology, as well as international
      cooperation. This experience will provide China and other countries with valuable
      lessons for quickly coordinating and coping with future public health
      emergencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread
      from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in
      12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one
      case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a
      country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of
      African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. METHODS: We used
      data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected
      provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per
      country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with
      two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations
      Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious
      Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese
      regions contributing most to their risk. FINDINGS: Countries with the highest
      importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high
      capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria,
      Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and
      high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same
      exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the
      city of Beijing, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Many countries in Africa are
      stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations.
      Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently
      prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect 
      imported cases and to limit onward transmission. FUNDING: EU Framework Programme

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak
      of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China,
      which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention
      around the world. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral
      drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the
      novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate
      their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential 
      drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and
      therapeutic countermeasures. Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features,
      including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention
      and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.

TI  - The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest
      global health threats: what lessons have we learned?
LID - dyaa033 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyaa033 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and
      identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a
      critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their
      spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus
      outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus
      (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed
      literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms,
      treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk
      factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS:
      Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited
      reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of
      COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.
      Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to
      increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large
      hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major 
      international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the 
      outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub
      located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and
      eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two
      prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges 
      the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the
      uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the
      spread of infection.

AB  - In December 2019, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread across
      China and beyond. On February 12, 2020, WHO officially named the disease caused
      by the novel coronavirus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since most
      COVID-19 infected patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and characteristic CT
      imaging patterns, radiological examinations have become vital in early diagnosis 
      and assessment of disease course. To date, CT findings have been recommended as
      major evidence for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. This review
      focuses on the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19, while
      highlighting the role of chest CT in prevention and disease control. A full
      translation of this article in Chinese is available.

AB  - The next decade is likely to produce any number of global challenges that will
      affect health and health care, including pan-national infections such as the new 
      coronavirus COVID-19 and others that will be related to global warming. Nurses
      will be required to react to these events, even though they will also be affected
      as ordinary citizens. The future resilience of healthcare services will depend on
      having sufficient numbers of nurses who are adequately resourced to face the
      coming challenges.

AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;
      previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease
      (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is 
      a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health
      Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been
      identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China.
      On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health
      emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two
      bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 
      and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or 
      direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period
      of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with
      pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), 
      fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement 
      with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography
      images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is
      responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China.
      Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the
      primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep
      monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus
      and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

AB  - The 2019-nCoV infection that is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus was first
      detected in China in the end of December 2019 and declared a public health
      emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on January
      30, 2020. Community pharmacists in one of the first areas that had confirmed
      cases of the viral infection, Macau, joined the collaborative force in supporting
      the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements. This paper
      aimed to improve the understanding of community pharmacists' role in case of
      2019-CoV outbreak based on the practical experiences in consultation with the
      recommendations made by the International Pharmaceutical Federation on the
      Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak.

TI  - Incubation Period and Other Epidemiological Characteristics of 2019 Novel
      Coronavirus Infections with Right Truncation: A Statistical Analysis of Publicly 
      Available Case Data.
LID - E538 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020538 [doi]
AB  - The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the
      epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural
      history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data
      from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period
      and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19
      infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of
      2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated
      using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to
      hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days
      without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th
      percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of
      quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from
      illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when 
      estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.

LID - 10.1186/s40169-020-00271-z [doi]
AB  - An ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei
      province, China at the end of 2019. With the spread of the new coronavirus
      accelerating, person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospitals, and
      intercity spread of 2019-nCoV occurred. At least 40,261 cases confirmed, 23,589
      cases suspected, 909 cases death and 3444 cases cured in China and worldwide 24
      countries confirmed 383 cases being diagnosed, 1 case death in February 10th,
      2020. At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3%, compared with 9.6%
      of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO. It seems the new virus is not as fatal
      as many people thought. Chinese authorities improved surveillance network, made
      the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced
      the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control. More
      comprehensive information is required to understand 2019-nCoV feature, the
      epidemiology of origin and spreading, and the clinical phenomina. According to
      the current status, blocking transmission, isolation, protection, and alternative
      medication are the urgent management strategies against 2019-nCoV.

AB  - Since late December 2019, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases
      (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. With the spread of
      COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients
      has been disturbed. Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients
      caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more
      susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Furthermore, patients with
      cancer had poorer prognosis from infection. Lung cancer patients should be the
      priority group for COVID-19 prevention. The protection provisions and control
      measures aiming to protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been
      increasingly concerned. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be
      carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer
      patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of
      COVID-19. Moreover, it is necessary to carry out meticulous and individualized
      clinical management for lung cancer patients to effectively protect the patients 
      from COVID-19.

AB  - In December 2019, China diagnosed the first patient with 2019 novel coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19), and the following development of the epidemic had a huge
      impact on China and the whole world. For patients with lung occupying lesions,
      the whole process of diagnosis and treatment can not be carried out as usual due 
      to the epidemic. For thoracic surgeons, the timing of surgical intervention
      should be very carefully considered. All thoracic surgeons in China should work
      together to develop the proper procedures for the diagnosis and treatment in this
      special situation, and continuously update the recommendations based on epidemic 
      changes and further understanding of COVID-19. Here, we only offer some
      preliminary suggestions based on our own knowledge for further reference and
      discussion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics of patients in Zhejiang
      province, China, infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019).
      DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province,
      China. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed
      SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January
      2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data, collected using a standardised case
      report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If
      information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor
      responsible for treating the patient for clarification. RESULTS: Of the 62
      patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive
      care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of 
      the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan
      seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected
      by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were
      fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%),
      headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and
      haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on
      admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days
      (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital
      admission was 2 (1-4) days. CONCLUSION: As of early February 2020, compared with 
      patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in
      Zhejiang province are relatively mild.

AB  - There is a current worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV),
      which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 17 other countries.
      Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a
      global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing
      of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control
      activities. This information should include reports from outbreak sites and from 
      laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates
      the virology, epidemiology, clinical management strategies from both English and 
      Chinese literature, official news channels, and other official government
      documents. In addition, by fitting the number of infections with a single-term
      exponential model, we report that the infection is spreading at an exponential
      rate, with a doubling period of 1.8 days.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2)
      causing a cluster of respiratory infections (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) 
      in Wuhan, China, was identified on 7 January 2020. The epidemic quickly
      disseminated from Wuhan and as at 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been
      confirmed in 25 countries, including 1,116 deaths. Strengthened surveillance was 
      implemented in France on 10 January 2020 in order to identify imported cases
      early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of risk exposure and
      follow-up procedure were defined for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were
      confirmed on 24 January, the first cases in Europe. Contact tracing was
      immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as at low risk of exposure
      and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been
      discharged and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no 
      secondary transmission has been identified. Effective collaboration between all
      parties involved in the surveillance and response to emerging threats is required
      to detect imported cases early and to implement adequate control measures.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan,
      China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that
      2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia,
      thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this
      disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection 
      from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through
      oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients
      also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted
      investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. 
      We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal
      swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting
      shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route. We also showed
      serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future
      epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed
      through multiple routes.

AB  - Objective: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan,
      China has spread quickly nationwide. Here, we report results of a descriptive,
      exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All
      COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's
      Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient
      characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3)
      calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of
      viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis.
      Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186
      (22.4%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6%) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and
      889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%)-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed 
      cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and
      considered mild (80.9%). A total of 1 023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases
      for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. The COVID-19 spread outward from Hubei
      sometime after December 2019 and by February 11, 2020, 1 386 counties across all 
      31 provinces were affected. The epidemic curve of onset of symptoms peaked in
      January 23-26, then began to decline leading up to February 11. A total of 1 716 
      health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3%). Conclusions: The
      COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. It only took 30 days to expand from
      Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long
      holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic.

AB  - Objective: To describe the characteristics of clinical manifestations and
      epidemiology of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.
      Methods: All 34 children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by
      quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR through nasopharyngeal swab
      specimens were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January
      19 to Febuary 7, 2020. Clinical data and epidemiological history of these
      patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: Among the 34
      cases, 14 were males, and 20 were females. The median age was 8 years and 11
      months. No patients had underlying diseases. There were 28 children (82%) related
      with a family cluster outbreak. There were 26 children (76%) with a travel or
      residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into
      different clinical types, including 22 (65%) common cases, 9 (26%) mild cases and
      3 (8.8%) asymptomatic cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The
      most common symptoms were fever (17 cases, 50%) and cough (13 cases, 38% ). In
      the 34 cases, the white blood cell counts of 28 cases (82%) were normal. Five
      cases had white blood cell counts more than 10x10(9)/L. One case had white blood 
      cell counts less than 4x10(9)/L. Neutropenia and lymphopenia was found in one
      case, respectively. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rates
      were elevated in 1 and 5 case, respectively. Elevated procalcitonin was found in 
      1 case and D-Dimer in 3 cases. The levels of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were more
      than 400 U/L in 10 cases. The CT images of these patients showed bilateral
      multiple patchy or nodular ground-glass opacities and/or infiltrating shadows in 
      middle and outer zone of the lung or under the pleura. Twenty patients were
      treated with lopinavir and ritonavir. Glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin were not
      used in any cases. All the cases improved and were discharged from hospital.
      Further following up was need. Conclusions: The clinical manifestations in
      children with 2019-nCoV infection are non-specific and are milder than that in
      adults. Chest CT scanning is heplful for early diagnosis. Children's infection is
      mainly caused by family cluster outbreak and imported cases. Family daily
      prevention is the main way to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.

TI  - Challenges to the system of reserve medical supplies for public health
      emergencies: reflections on the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in China.
PG  - 3-8
LID - 10.5582/bst.2020.01043 [doi]
AB  - On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced an outbreak
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), China is now at 
      a critical period in the control of the epidemic. The Chinese Government has been
      taking a series of rapid, comprehensive, and effective prevention and control
      measures. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a
      serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage 
      of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing.
      This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention
      and control. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to
      quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and 
      it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the
      emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and
      there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency
      medical supplies. A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the 
      management of public health emergencies. Based on international experiences with 
      pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency
      reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public
      health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of
      international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies
      of international concern in the future.

AB  - Through literature review and group discussion, Special Expert Group for Control 
      of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine
      Association formulated an update on the epidemiological characteristics of novel 
      coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). The initial source of the 2019 novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) was the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with
      pangolins as a potential animal host. Currently the main source of infection is
      NCP patients, and asymptomatic carriers may also be infectious. The virus is
      believed transmitted mostly via droplets or contact. People are all generally
      susceptible to the virus. The average incubation period was 5.2 days, and the
      basic reproductive number R(0) was 2.2 at the onset of the outbreak. Most NCP
      patients were clinically mild cases. The case fatality rate was 2.38%, and
      elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death. Strategies
      for prevention and control of NCP include improving epidemic surveillance,
      quarantining the source of infection, speeding up the diagnosis of suspected
      cases, optimizing the management of close contacts, tightening prevention and
      control of cluster outbreaks and hospital infection, preventing possible rebound 
      of the epidemic after people return to work from the Chinese Spring Festival
      holiday, and strengthening community prevention and control.

TI  - Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in Wuhan, China, 2020: Intense Surveillance Is Vital
      for Preventing Sustained Transmission in New Locations.
LID - E498 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020498 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 24,500
      confirmed cases, including 492 deaths, as of 5 February 2020. The virus
      (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South
      Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has only been limited
      human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here, we assess the risk of
      sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data 
      describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients
      infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the
      probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human
      transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of
      the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the
      SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained 
      human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]). However, if
      the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense
      surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained
      transmission is only 0.012 (credible interval [0, 0.099]). This emphasises the
      importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to
      ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a global pandemic.

AB  - Reanalysis of the epidemic curve from the initial cluster of cases with novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in December 2019 indicates substantial human-to-human
      transmission. It is possible that the common exposure history at a seafood market
      in Wuhan originated from the human-to-human transmission events within the
      market, and the early, strong emphasis that market exposure indicated
      animal-to-human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias. To
      support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan
      seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the
      market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market.
      As these requirements remain unmet, zoonotic spillover at the market must not be 
      overemphasized.

AB  - In December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan City in
      central China's Hubei Province. Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from
      patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the
      etiology (1). As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had
      been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other
      countries, including 11 in the United States (2,3). On January 17, CDC and the
      U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health
      screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City
      (4). CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a
      process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection
      (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public 
      health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 
      650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria
      for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic
      persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had
      travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill
      laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and
      contact-related risks. Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV
      infection. Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to identifying
      cases and preventing further transmission. Health care providers should remain
      vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices
      when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection (6). Providers should
      consult with their local and state health departments when assessing not only ill

TI  - Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from (Wuhan) Coronavirus 2019-nCoV
      Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus
      Infections.
LID - E194 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v12020194 [doi]
AB  - In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was
      identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of
      China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a
      newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV. The infection moved rapidly
      through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries
      through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple
      countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing
      the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from
      human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is
      estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in
      special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus 
      infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have 
      become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the
      potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity 
      and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published
      data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other
      coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are
      also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials,
      and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV). METHODS: Based on the
      susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption 
      that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are
      resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic
      reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and
      suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by
      other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned
      from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: The basic
      reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on
      the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall
      between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from
      international colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: The early transmission ability of
      2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease 
      with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are
      needed to prevent the further transmissions.

AB  - The global spread of the 2019-nCoV is continuing and is fast moving, as indicated
      by the WHO raising the risk assessment to high. In this article, we provide a
      preliminary phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis of this new virus. A
      Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using the 29 available whole genome
      sequences of 2019-nCoV and two whole genome sequences that are highly similar
      sequences from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus available in GeneBank. We are able to
      clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the
      2019-nCoV sequence isolates from their patients. The Bayesian phylogeographic
      reconstruction shows that the 2019-2020 nCoV most probably originated from the
      Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family. In agreement
      with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new
      outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019-nCoV time of the most recent
      common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November
      25(th), 2019. These results, together with previously recorded epidemics, suggest
      a recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks due to Betacoronavirus.
      Moreover, our study describes the same population genetic dynamic underlying the 
      SARS 2003 epidemic, and suggests the urgent need for the development of effective
      molecular surveillance strategies of Betacoronavirus among animals and
      Rhinolophus of the bat family.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia that
      started in Wuhan, China. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88
      confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we 
      estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval:
      5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These
      values should help inform 2019-nCoV case definitions and appropriate quarantine
      durations.

LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000080 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated effectiveness of thermal passenger screening for 2019-nCoV infection
      at airport exit and entry to inform public health decision-making. In our
      baseline scenario, we estimated that 46% (95% confidence interval: 36 to 58) of
      infected travellers would not be detected, depending on incubation period,
      sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and proportion of asymptomatic cases.
      Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV
      infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers.

TI  - A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern 
      China.
PG  - 77-85
LID - 10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic
      disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are 
      known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading 
      to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing
      appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in
      rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and
      enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and
      field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and
      protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community
      and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field
      observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human-animal
      interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities
      were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes 
      existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study explored the relationship among zoonotic risk and human
      behaviour, environment and policies in rural communities in southern China. It
      identifies key behavioural risk factors that can be targeted for development of
      tailored risk-mitigation strategies to reduce the threat of novel zoonoses.

AB  - In about 20 days since the diagnosis of the first case of the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Korea on January 20, 2020, 28 cases have been
      confirmed. Fifteen patients (53.6%) of them were male and median age of was 42
      years (range, 20-73). Of the confirmed cases, 16, 9, and 3 were index (57.2%),
      first-generation (32.1%), and second-generation (10.7%) cases, respectively. All 
      first-generation and second-generation patients were family members or intimate
      acquaintances of the index cases with close contacts. Fifteen among 16 index
      patients had entered Korea from January 19 to 24, 2020 while 1 patient had
      entered Korea on January 31, 2020. The average incubation period was 3.9 days
      (median, 3.0), and the reproduction number was estimated as 0.48. Three of the
      confirmed patients were asymptomatic when they were diagnosed. Epidemiological
      indicators will be revised with the availability of additional data in the
      future. Sharing epidemiological information among researchers worldwide is
      essential for efficient preparation and response in tackling this new infectious 
      disease.

TI  - The Rate of Underascertainment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection:
      Estimation Using Japanese Passengers Data on Evacuation Flights.
LID - E419 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020419 [doi]
AB  - From 29 to 31 January 2020, a total of 565 Japanese citizens were evacuated from 
      Wuhan, China on three chartered flights. All passengers were screened upon
      arrival in Japan for symptoms consistent with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      infection and tested for presence of the virus. Assuming that the mean detection 
      window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5
      days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence 
      interval: 5.0, 20.0). This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can
      be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic
      and mildly symptomatic infections. The infection fatality risk (IFR)-the actual
      risk of death among all infected individuals-is therefore 0.3% to 0.6%, which may
      be comparable to Asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958.

PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/s40779-020-0233-6 [doi]
AB  - In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei
      Province; and then named "2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)" by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced
      respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it
      attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the
      request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV
      infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be
      developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice
      guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also
      added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
      This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological
      characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis,
      treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial
      infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover,
      we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe
      2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for
      2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first
      frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections,
      community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person 
      who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.

AB  - On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of
      acute respiratory illness in persons associated with the Hunan seafood and animal
      market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China. On January 7,
      2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was
      associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of
      20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425
      deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2).
      Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China,
      including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). 
      As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30,
      the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV 
      outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(dagger) 
      On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary
      declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.( section sign)
      Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a "Proclamation on 
      Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of
      Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus," which limits entry into the United States
      of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent
      residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and
      local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures
      to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). These measures
      require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and
      the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to 
      the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of
      additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might
      not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the
      virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of
      illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general
      public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness
      occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health
      recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including
      diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring
      the situation closely. As more is learned about this novel virus and this
      outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by 
      CDC and state and local health departments.

AB  - BackgroundThe chest CT findings of patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have not previously been described in detail.PurposeTo
      investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV 
      pneumonia in humans.Materials and MethodsFifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women;
      age range 16-76 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using
      real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section 
      CT. The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were
      evaluated.ResultsFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with
      individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and
      cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal
      white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and
      either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count. CT
      images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO 
      with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. 
      GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure
      consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%)
      patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the
      posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more
      consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT
      scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P < .001).
      Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those
      aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P < .001). Follow-up CT in 13
      patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%)
      patients.ConclusionPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous
      ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, 
      combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic
      exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      pneumonia.(c) RSNA, 2020.

AB  - To investigate the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of
      the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and beyond, a total of 32 genomes of virus
      strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with sampling dates between 24 
      December 2019 and 23 January 2020 were analyzed. Phylogenetic, transmission
      network, and likelihood-mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed. 
      On the basis of the likelihood-mapping analysis, the increasing tree-like signals
      (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing
      genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV in human hosts. We identified three phylogenetic
      clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters
      using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both
      methods using the above genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains. The estimated mean
      evolutionary rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 1.7926 x 10(-3) to 1.8266 x 10(-3)
      substitutions per site per year. On the basis of our study, undertaking
      epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively
      impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce 2019-nCOV
      transmission in real-time.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, China is currently
      recognized as a public health emergency of global concern. METHODS: We reviewed
      the currently available literature to provide up-to-date guidance on control
      measures to be implemented by public health authorities. RESULTS: Some of the
      epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV have been identified. However, there
      remain considerable uncertainties, which should be considered when providing
      guidance to public health authorities on control measures. CONCLUSIONS:
      Additional studies incorporating more detailed information from confirmed cases
      would be valuable.

TI  - The first two cases of 2019-nCoV in Italy: Where they come from?
PG  - 518-521
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25699 [doi]
AB  - A novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an 
      ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December
      2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very
      recently Italy. In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to
      better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first
      introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a
      couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as
      Coronavirus Italian cases. A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using 
      a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus two closely related bat
      strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GenBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic
      analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic
      reconstruction showed that 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25
      November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide,
      including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January
      2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated
      outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of
      likely imported cases in Rome, Italy, and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this
      report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human 
      mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent
      further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool
      for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which initially began in China, has
      spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of confirmed cases
      increasing every day. With a death toll exceeding that of the SARS-CoV outbreak
      back in 2002 and 2003 in China, 2019-nCoV has led to a public health emergency of
      international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. Herein, we
      present on an overview of the currently available information on the
      pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of
      this virus.

AB  - From December 2019, an outbreak of unusual pneumonia was reported in Wuhan with
      many cases linked to Huanan Seafood Market that sells seafood as well as live
      exotic animals. We investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory
      syndromes after independent contact history with this market. The two patients
      shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground-glass
      opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. Here, we
      highlight the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS)
      approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It rapidly
      identified a novel coronavirus (named 2019-nCoV according to World Health
      Organization announcement) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very
      high abundance level (1.5% and 0.62% of total RNA sequenced). The entire viral
      genome is 29,881 nt in length (GenBank MN988668 and MN988669, Sequence Read
      Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736) and is classified into
      beta-coronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that 2019-nCoV is close
      to coronaviruses (CoVs) circulating in Rhinolophus (Horseshoe bats), such as
      98.7% nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene of bat coronavirus strain
      BtCoV/4991 (GenBank KP876546, 370 nt sequence of RdRp and lack of other genome
      sequence) and 87.9% nucleotide identity to bat coronavirus strain bat-SL-CoVZC45 
      and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S, and N genes also
      suggests 2019-nCoV is more likely a novel CoV independently introduced from
      animals to humans.

AB  - Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia.
      We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% 
      high density interval: 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained
      human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar
      magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
      pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread.

AB  - As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed
      outside China. We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe from affected
      areas in China via air travel. We consider travel restrictions in place, three
      reported cases in France, one in Germany. Estimated risk in Europe remains high. 
      The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk. Importation from
      Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe.

AB  - On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City 
      in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).
      As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection,
      including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries. Therefore, combating 
      this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency. Here, we focus
      on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as
      potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.

TI  - A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.
PG  - 270-273

AB  - Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a
      large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in
      their natural reservoir host, bats(1-4). Previous studies have shown that some
      bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans(5-7). Here we report the
      identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which
      caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The
      epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794
      laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020.
      Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage
      of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence
      identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the
      whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of
      seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to
      the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by 
      sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same
      cell entry receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-as SARS-CoV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an
      outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
      Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally,
      threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the
      size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from
      Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic
      and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and
      non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. METHODS: We used data from Dec 31,
      2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally
      (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the
      number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported
      domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of
      2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan
      and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly
      flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility
      across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent
      database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the
      Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were
      based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was
      used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic
      reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and
      presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).
      FINDINGS: In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive
      number for 2019-nCoV was 2.68 (95% CrI 2.47-2.86) and that 75 815 individuals
      (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The
      epidemic doubling time was 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8-7.1). We estimated that in the
      baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had
      imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80
      (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of
      2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that
      epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China
      with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION:
      Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese
      cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with
      close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless
      substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal
      levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in
      major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation 
      of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health
      interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied 
      for quick deployment globally. FUNDING: Health and Medical Research Fund (Hong

TI  - History is repeating itself: Probable zoonotic spillover as the cause of the 2019
      novel Coronavirus Epidemic
PG  - 3-5
AB  - Pathogen transmission from a vertebrate animal to a human, also known as zoonotic
      spillover, represents a global public health burden, which while associated with 
      multiple outbreaks, still remains a poorly understood phenomenon. Coronaviruses, 
      like influenza viruses, circulate in nature in various animal species.
      Alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses can infect mammals and
      gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses tend to infect birds, but some of
      them can also be transmitted to mammals. Although still preliminary, current data
      suggest that bats are the most probable initial source of the current 2019 novel 
      CoV (2019nCoV) outbreak, that begun on December 2019 in Wuhan, China, apparently 
      spreading from a "wet market" to multiple cities and provinces in China. This
      epidemic of 2019nCoV, already reaching more than 6,000 cases to-day (end of
      January 2020) (>90% in China), will not be the last one linked to zoonotic
      spillover events.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit
      a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other
      provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic
      reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.
      METHODS: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate,
      we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China 
      from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the
      estimated intrinsic growth rate (gamma), we estimated R0 by using the serial
      intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as
      approximations for the true unknown SI. FINDINGS: The early outbreak data largely
      follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24
      (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold
      increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate
      substantially affect estimates of R0. CONCLUSION: The mean estimate of R0 for the
      2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1. Our
      findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due 
      to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel
      coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally 
      named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000
      cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people
      living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. 
      METHODS: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the
      Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences
      were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger
      sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions
      determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these
      2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the
      evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology
      modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the
      virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine
      patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99.98% sequence identity.
      Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived
      severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and
      bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more
      distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis
      revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus
      Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives
      bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.
      Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar
      receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid
      variation at some key residues. INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently
      divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.
      Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host 
      of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an
      intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly,
      structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution,
      adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation. FUNDING:

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the 
      epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In 
      this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of
      2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were
      confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic,
      clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed
      up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 
      (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of 
      the patients was 55.5 years (SD 13.1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV
      was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic
      diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),
      cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache
      (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%]
      patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients),
      chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and
      vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients 
      showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and
      ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients
      developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients 
      worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.
      INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely
      to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal
      respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general,
      characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an
      early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further
      investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in
      predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection. FUNDING: National Key
      R&D Program of China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human
      transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city 
      of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships 
      of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of 
      sarbecovirus. METHODS: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and
      Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic
      fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and
      Bayesian methods. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although
      closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence
      similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus
      sequences. Specifically, in the 5'-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and
      the last 3'-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a 
      single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle
      region spanning the 3'-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike
      regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the
      sarbecovirus branch. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of genetic similarity between the
      2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant
      that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has
      originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus 
      (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct
      lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential
      association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further
      attention.

TI  - Receptor Recognition by the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan: an Analysis Based on
      Decade-Long Structural Studies of SARS Coronavirus.

AB  - Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing 
      symptoms in humans similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural
      analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike
      protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and
      human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential
      receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the
      newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD,
      including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is
      similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its 
      receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly
      Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with
      2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical
      residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not
      ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some
      capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis
      indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2
      from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these
      animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV
      infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, 
      host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic
      surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.IMPORTANCE The recent
      emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is 
      reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural 
      studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions 
      between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting
      enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human
      transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an 
      atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate
      epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify
      potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses. Based on the sequence of
      2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel
      insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This study
      provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic,
      translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights
      that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia
      (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January
      2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the
      epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS: We collected information on
      demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of
      laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We
      described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic
      time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated
      the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS: Among the 
      first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were 
      male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked 
      to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent
      cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1
      to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early 
      stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval 
      of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to
      be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this information, there
      is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts
      since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission
      will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.
      Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations
      at risk. (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.).

AB  - To help health workers and the public recognize and deal with the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) quickly, effectively, and calmly with an updated
      understanding. A comprehensive search from Chinese and worldwide official
      websites and announcements was performed between 1 December 2019 and 9:30 am 26
      January 2020 (Beijing time). A latest summary of 2019-nCoV and the current
      outbreak was drawn. Up to 24 pm, 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases of
      2019-nCoV infection were confirmed in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths
      having occurred. The latest mortality was approximately 2.84% with a total of
      2684 cases still suspected. The China National Health Commission reported the
      details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm, 22 January 2020. The deaths included 
      13 males and 4 females. The median age of the people who died was 75 (range
      48-89) years. Fever (64.7%) and cough (52.9%) were the most common first symptoms
      among those who died. The median number of days from the occurence of the first
      symptom to death was 14.0 (range 6-41) days, and it tended to be shorter among
      people aged 70 years or more (11.5 [range 6-19] days) than those aged less than
      70 years (20 [range 10-41] days; P = .033). The 2019-nCoV infection is spreading 
      and its incidence is increasing nationwide. The first deaths occurred mostly in
      elderly people, among whom the disease might progress faster. The public should
      still be cautious in dealing with the virus and pay more attention to protecting 
      the elderly people from the virus.

PG  - 455-459
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25688 [doi]
AB  - There is a worldwide concern about the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV as a global
      public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and 
      molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has
      been built using the 15 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, 12 whole
      genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, and 12 highly similar whole genome sequences
      available in gene bank (five from the severe acute respiratory syndrome, two from
      Middle East respiratory syndrome, and five from bat SARS-like coronavirus). Fast 
      unconstrained Bayesian approximation analysis shows that the nucleocapsid and the
      spike glycoprotein have some sites under positive pressure, whereas homology
      modeling revealed some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. 
      The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019-nCoV significantly clustered with bat
      SARS-like coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis
      revealed mutation in Spike Glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. From these
      results, the new 2019-nCoV is distinct from SARS virus, probably trasmitted from 
      bats after mutation conferring ability to infect humans.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged 
      recently in Wuhan, China. Information on reported cases strongly indicates
      human-to-human spread, and the most recent information is increasingly indicative
      of sustained human-to-human transmission. While the overall severity profile
      among cases may change as more mild cases are identified, we estimate a risk of
      fatality among hospitalised cases at 14% (95% confidence interval: 3.9-32%).

LID - 10.3390/jcm9020330 [doi]
AB  - A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was
      reported by China in late December 2019. Reported case incidence has now reached 
      the hundreds, but this is likely an underestimate. As of 24 January 2020, with
      reports of thirteen exportation events, we estimate the cumulative incidence in
      China at 5502 cases (95% confidence interval: 3027, 9057). The most plausible
      number of infections is in the order of thousands, rather than hundreds, and
      there is a strong indication that untraced exposures other than the one in the
      epidemiologically linked seafood market in Wuhan have occurred.

AB  - The emergence of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has awakened the echoes of
      SARS-CoV from nearly two decades ago. Yet, with technological advances and
      important lessons gained from previous outbreaks, perhaps the world is better
      equipped to deal with the most recent emergent group 2B coronavirus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a 
      novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the
      epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and
      treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with
      suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We
      prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed
      2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were
      obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the
      International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from
      electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients 
      or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were
      also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit
      (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital
      patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. 
      Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had
      underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension
      (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49.0 years
      (IQR 41.0-58.0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood
      market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were
      fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18
      [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache
      (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).
      Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to 
      dyspnoea 8.0 days [IQR 5.0-13.0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All
      41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications
      included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]),
      acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) 
      patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU
      patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10,
      MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFalpha. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused
      clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.
      Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human
      transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus 
      was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were
      geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on
      person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. METHODS:
      In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological,
      and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented
      with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province,
      China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel
      to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were
      done. FINDINGS: From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who
      travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six
      family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the 
      novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, 
      became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the
      family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or
      animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged
      36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or 
      diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to
      our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days 
      after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had
      radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had
      more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes,
      lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate
      dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients
      were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR,
      but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes
      encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of
      this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic
      analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by
      next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is
      closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses 
      found in Chinese horseshoe bats. INTERPRETATION: Our findings are consistent with
      person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family
      settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

TI  - Emerging Viruses without Borders: The Wuhan Coronavirus.

AB  - The recently emerged coronavirus in Wuhan, China has claimed at least two lives
      as of January 17 and infected hundreds if not thousands of individuals. The
      situation has drawn international attention, including from the virology
      community. We applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of
      the new virus by Chinese virologists, but we also believe that increased
      transparency on disease reporting and data sharing with international colleagues 
      are crucial for curbing the spread of this newly emerging virus to other parts of
      the world.

AB  - The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing an
      outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in patients in Wuhan, a central city in
      China, is another warning of the risk of CoVs posed to public health. In this
      minireview, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of CoVs and
      describe diseases caused by different CoVs in humans and animals. This review
      will help understand the biology and potential risk of CoVs that exist in
      richness in wildlife such as bats.
