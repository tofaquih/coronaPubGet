Higher viral loads soon after symptom onset indicate the need for isolation strategies different from those used for the earlier SARS epidemic.',\n",

       " 'In this report, investigators in Germany detected the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from a person who had recently traveled from China to Germany for a business trip.
