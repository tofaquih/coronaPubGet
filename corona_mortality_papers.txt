AB  - As of 28 February 2020, Italy had 888 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with most
      cases in Northern Italy in the Lombardia and Veneto regions. Travel-related cases
      were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current
      epidemic in Italy. The month of February, however, has been dominated by two
      large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local 
      transmission the source of infections. Contact tracing has failed to identify
      patient zero in one of the outbreaks. As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of
      COVID-19 have died. Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are
      identical at 2.3. Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with
      fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities. It will be important
      to develop point-of-care devices to aid clinicians in stratifying elderly
      patients as early as possible to determine the potential level of care they will 
      require to improve their chances of survival from COVID-19 disease.

AB  - Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as
      SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However,
      there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug
      repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing
      drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug
      discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing
      methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, 
      quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in
      the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV
      whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide
      sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and
      nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved
      regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared 
      to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host
      interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV
      repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are
      further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced
      transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential
      drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus
      melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the "Complementary Exposure"
      pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target
      separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study
      offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate
      repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting
      2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - An Analysis of 38 Pregnant Women with COVID-19, Their Newborn Infants, and
      Maternal-Fetal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: Maternal Coronavirus Infections and
      Pregnancy Outcomes.
LID - 10.5858/arpa.2020-0901-SA [doi]
AB  - The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially
      life-threating respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly
      spread across the globe creating a massive public health problem. Previous
      epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor
      obstetrical outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal
      transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death. This communication
      reviews the effects of two previous coronavirus infections - severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory
      syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV - on pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it
      analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns
      in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including
      clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus
      from mother to fetus. This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of
      pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did
      not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS
      and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of
      SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens
      tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for
      SARS-CoV-2. At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is
      no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission
      from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Analysis of additional cases is
      necessary to determine if this remains true.

AB  - The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) from the Hubei province in China in late 2019 demonstrates the
      epidemic potential of coronaviruses. The rapid spread of this virus across the
      world in only 2 months highlights the transmissibility of this family of viruses 
      and the significant morbidity and mortality that they can cause. We highlight the
      current state of knowledge of coronavirus biology while answering questions
      concerning the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

      Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus
      Infections.
LID - E194 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v12020194 [doi]
AB  - In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was
      identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of
      China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a
      newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV. The infection moved rapidly
      through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries
      through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple
      countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing
      the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from
      human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is
      estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in
      special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus 
      infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have 
      become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the
      potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity 
      and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published
      data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other
      coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are
      also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials,
      and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.

AB  - To help health workers and the public recognize and deal with the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) quickly, effectively, and calmly with an updated
      understanding. A comprehensive search from Chinese and worldwide official
      websites and announcements was performed between 1 December 2019 and 9:30 am 26
      January 2020 (Beijing time). A latest summary of 2019-nCoV and the current
      outbreak was drawn. Up to 24 pm, 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases of
      2019-nCoV infection were confirmed in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths
      having occurred. The latest mortality was approximately 2.84% with a total of
      2684 cases still suspected. The China National Health Commission reported the
      details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm, 22 January 2020. The deaths included 
      13 males and 4 females. The median age of the people who died was 75 (range
      48-89) years. Fever (64.7%) and cough (52.9%) were the most common first symptoms
      among those who died. The median number of days from the occurence of the first
      symptom to death was 14.0 (range 6-41) days, and it tended to be shorter among
      people aged 70 years or more (11.5 [range 6-19] days) than those aged less than
      70 years (20 [range 10-41] days; P = .033). The 2019-nCoV infection is spreading 
      and its incidence is increasing nationwide. The first deaths occurred mostly in
      elderly people, among whom the disease might progress faster. The public should
      still be cautious in dealing with the virus and pay more attention to protecting 
      the elderly people from the virus.

AB  - The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global
      public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report
      our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed 
      (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host
      cell adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of 
      spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and
      camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our study
      also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein
      potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for
      hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique features of
      COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics.

AB  - A zoonotic coronavirus, tentatively labeled as 2019-nCoV by the World Health
      Organization (WHO), has been identified as the causative agent of the viral
      pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. Although 2019-nCoV can
      cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics
      suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much
      less than MERS-CoV. The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs 
      to be further assessed. To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic 
      or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency 
      response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the
      virus to refine the risk assessment and response. Here, the current knowledge in 
      2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with
      several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a
      better control of the disease is highlighted.

AB  - One of the most perplexing questions regarding the current COVID-19 coronavirus
      epidemic is the discrepancy between the severity of cases observed in the Hubei
      province of China and those occurring elsewhere in the world. One possible answer
      is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to
      other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained
      inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been
      documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to
      similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a 
      possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and
      deaths.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics
      of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a
      detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well
      described. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included 
      all adult inpatients (>/=18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from
      Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been
      discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and
      laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted
      from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.
      We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the 
      risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from 
      Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this
      study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had
      a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients),
      followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%]
      patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death
      associated with older age (odds ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.17, per year increase; 
      p=0.0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5.65,
      2.61-12.23; p<0.0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/L (18.42, 2.64-128.55;
      p=0.0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20.0 days (IQR
      17.0-24.0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in
      non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was
      37 days. INTERPRETATION: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA
      score, and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/L could help clinicians to identify
      patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides
      the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal
      antiviral interventions in the future. FUNDING: Chinese Academy of Medical

TI  - Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.
LID - 10.1002/ddr.21656 [doi]
AB  - At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 
      epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS 
      coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid
      spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing
      vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines
      based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus
      epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus
      strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion
      based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new
      coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R)
      blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and
      mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations
      that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding
      site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic,
      similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This
      commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative
      treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on
      datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.

TI  - Lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy amongst symptomatic coronavirus disease
      2019 patients in India: Protocol for restricted public health emergency use.
LID - 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_502_20 [doi]
AB  - As of February 29, 2020, more than 85,000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been reported from China and 53 other countries with 2,924
      deaths. On January 30, 2020, the first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID was
      reported from Kerala, India. In view of the earlier evidence about effectiveness 
      of repurposed lopinavir/ritonavir against severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV), as well as 
      preliminary docking studies conducted by the ICMR-National Institute of Virology,
      Pune, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization approved the restricted
      public health use of lopinavir/ritonavir combination amongst symptomatic COVID-19
      patients detected in the country. Hospitalized adult patients with
      laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any one of the following criteria 
      will be eligible to receive lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days after obtaining
      written informed consent: (i) respiratory distress with respiratory rate
      >/=22/min or SpO2 of <94 per cent; (ii) lung parenchymal infiltrates on chest
      X-ray; (iii) hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or need for 
      vasopressor/inotropic medication; (iv) new-onset organ dysfunction; and (v)
      high-risk groups - age >60 yr, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung
      disease and immunocompromised persons. Patients will be monitored to document
      clinical (hospital length of stay and mortality at 14, 28 and 90 days),
      laboratory (presence of viral RNA in serial throat swab samples) and safety
      (adverse events and serious adverse events) outcomes. Treatment outcomes amongst 
      initial cases would be useful in providing guidance about the clinical management
      of patients with COVID-19. If found useful in managing initial
      SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, further evaluation using a randomized control trial
      design is warranted to guide future therapeutic use of this combination.

AB  - As of 22 February 2020, more than 77662 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have been
      documented globally with over 2360 deaths. Common presentations of confirmed
      cases include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum
      production, shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged
      prothrombin time, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate
      dehydrogenase. The reported severe/critical case ratio is approximately 7-10% and
      median time to intensive care admission is 9.5-10.5 days with mortality of around
      1-2% varied geographically. Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus,
      there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed
      the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid
      and supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial. In China,
      Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial
      guidelines with substantial utilization. We reviewed the latest national and
      provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series
      regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine. We have also
      reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management with
      hypothesized mechanisms and latest in silico findings to identify candidate
      Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management. Given 
      the paucity of strongly evidence-based regimens, the available data suggest that 
      Chinese medicine could be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic option in the
      management of COVID-19.

TI  - Estimating Risk for Death from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease, China,
      January-February 2020.
LID - 10.3201/eid2606.200233 [doi]
AB  - Since December 2019, when the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) was identified in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei Province of China,
      the epidemic has generated tens of thousands of cases throughout China. As of
      February 28, 2020, the cumulative number of reported deaths in China was 2,858.
      We estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in Wuhan, as
      well as for China excluding Wuhan, to assess the severity of the epidemic in the 
      country. Our estimates of the risk for death in Wuhan reached values as high as
      12% in the epicenter of the epidemic and approximately 1% in other, more mildly
      affected areas. The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a 
      breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health
      interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be
      implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control.

PG  - 1-21
AB  - Prior to the global outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were
      the only coronaviruses known to infect humans. Following the SARS outbreak, 5
      additional coronaviruses have been discovered in humans, most recently the novel 
      coronavirus COVID-19, believed to have originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
      China. SARS-CoV and MERSCoV are particularly pathogenic in humans and are
      associated with high mortality. In this review, the epidemiology,
      pathophysiology, and management of the recently discovered COVID-19 are reviewed,
      with a focus on best practices and the public health implications.

AB  - In December 2019, an outbreak of novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) occurred in Wuhan,
      Hubei Province, China. By February 14, 2020, it has led to 66 492 confirmed
      patients in China and high mortality up to approximately 2.96% (1123/37 914) in
      Wuhan. Here we report the first family case of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) confirmed in Wuhan and treated using the combination of western
      medicine and Chinese traditional patent medicine Shuanghuanglian oral liquid
      (SHL). This report describes the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and 
      management of three cases from a family, suggests the expected therapeutic
      effects of SHL on COVID-19, and warrants further clinical trials.

TI  - Clinical Features of 69 Cases with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China.
LID - ciaa272 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa272 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: From December 2019 to February 2020, 2019 severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a serious outbreak of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Related clinical features are needed.
      METHODS: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan
      between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020.
      RESULTS: The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0),
      and 32 patients (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]),
      cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy 
      (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).
      As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five
      patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%. According to the lowest SpO2
      during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2>/=90% group (n=55) and the
      SpO2<90% group (n=14). All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2<90% group. Compared with
      SpO2>/=90% group, patients of the SpO2<90% group were older, and showed more
      comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c
      reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging
      rate and decrease the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to show
      frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a 
      mortality rate of 7.5%. Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are
      at higher risk of death.

AB  - In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as
      the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a
      formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including
      Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our
      country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named
      as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also
      named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan 
      CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth
      category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate
      (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through
      droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection
      control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may
      jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, there is no definite
      treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly
      identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of
      the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.

AB  - A novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV, hit the central Chinese city of
      Wuhan in late December 2019, and subsequently spread rapidly to all provinces of 
      China and multiple countries. As of 0:00 am February 9, 2020, a total of 37,287
      cases have been confirmed infection of 2019-nCoV in China mainland, and 302 cases
      have also been cumulatively reported from 24 countries. According to the latest
      data, a total of 813 deaths occurred in China mainland, with the mortality
      reaching approximately 2.2%. At present, there is no vaccine or specific drugs
      for the human coronavirus. Therefore, it is critical to understand the nature of 
      the virus and its clinical characteristics, in order to respond to the 2019-nCoV 
      outbreak. Thus, the present study briefly but comprehensively summarizes the not 
      much but timely reports on the 2019-nCoV.

AB  - Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the new
      coronavirus 2019-nCoV patients combined with cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 112 COVID-19 patients with CVD
      admitted to the western district of Union Hospital in Wuhan, from January 20,
      2020 to February 15, 2020. They were divided into critical group (ICU, n=16) and 
      general group (n=96) according to the severity of the disease and patients were
      followed up to the clinical endpoint. The observation indicators included total
      blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial blood gas analysis, myocardial
      injury markers, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolyte,
      procalcitonin (PCT), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood lipid, pulmonary CT 
      and pathogen detection. Results: Compared with the general group, the lymphocyte 
      count (0.74x10(9) (0.34x10(9), 0.94x10(9))/L vs. 0.99x10(9) (0.71x10(9),
      1.29x10(9))/L, P=0.03) was extremely lower in the critical group, CRP (106.98
      (81.57, 135.76) mg/L vs. 34.34 (9.55,76.54) mg/L, P<0.001) and PCT (0.20
      (0.15,0.48) mug/L vs. 0.11 (0.06,0.20)mug/L, P<0.001) were significantly higher
      in the critical group. The BMI of the critical group was significantly higher
      than that of the general group (25.5 (23.0, 27.5) kg/m(2) vs. 22.0 (20.0, 24.0)
      kg/m(2), P=0.003). Patients were further divided into non-survivor group (17,
      15.18%) group and survivor group (95, 84.82%). Among the non-survivors, there
      were 88.24% (15/17) patients with BMI> 25 kg/m(2), which was significantly higher
      than that of survivors (18.95% (18/95), P<0.001). Compared with the survived
      patients, oxygenation index (130 (102, 415) vs. 434 (410, 444), P<0.001) was
      significantly lower and lactic acid (1.70 (1.30, 3.00) mmol/L vs. 1.20 (1.10,
      1.60) mmol/L, P<0.001) was significantly higher in the non-survivors. There was
      no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between the
      critical group and the general group or between non-survivors and survivors (all 
      P>0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients combined with CVD are associated with a
      higher risk of mortality. Critical patients are characterized with lower
      lymphocyte counts. Higher BMI are more often seen in critical patients and
      non-survivor. ACEI/ARB use does not affect the morbidity and mortality of
      COVID-19 combined with CVD. Aggravating causes of death include fulminant
      inflammation, lactic acid accumulation and thrombotic events.

AB  - Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected
      pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for
      diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive
      patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image
      findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with
      mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women,
      with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered
      condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was
      higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). 
      The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival
      group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of
      ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and
      central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score
      of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12
      (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P =
      0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a 
      CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the
      prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with 
      chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground
      glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined
      peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly
      involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.

AB  - Objective: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan,
      China has spread quickly nationwide. Here, we report results of a descriptive,
      exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All
      COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's
      Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient
      characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3)
      calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of
      viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis.
      Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186
      (22.4%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6%) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and
      889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%)-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed 
      cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and
      considered mild (80.9%). A total of 1 023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases
      for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. The COVID-19 spread outward from Hubei
      sometime after December 2019 and by February 11, 2020, 1 386 counties across all 
      31 provinces were affected. The epidemic curve of onset of symptoms peaked in
      January 23-26, then began to decline leading up to February 11. A total of 1 716 
      health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3%). Conclusions: The
      COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. It only took 30 days to expand from
      Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long
      holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus from China, is spreading around the world,
      causing a huge reaction despite its current low incidence outside China and the
      Far East. Four common coronaviruses are in current circulation and cause millions
      of cases worldwide. This article compares the incidence and mortality rates of
      these four common coronaviruses with those of SARS-COV-2 in Organisation for
      Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It is concluded that the problem
      of SARS-CoV-2 is probably being overestimated, as 2.6 million people die of
      respiratory infections each year compared with less than 4000 deaths for
      SARS-CoV-2 at the time of writing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease
      with lack of established laboratory markers available to evaluate illness
      severity. In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could
      differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease.
      Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19.
      METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed
      to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A
      meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD)
      of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds
      ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies
      with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in
      the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was
      significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31x10(9)/L; 95%
      CI, from -35 to -29x10(9)/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival,
      found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48x10(9)/L;
      95% CI, -57 to -39x10(9)/L. In the four studies (n=1427) which reported data on
      rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold 
      enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). CONCLUSIONS: Low
      platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality 
      in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of
      worsening illness during hospitalization.

TI  - Rapid Progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Review of Current
      Understanding of Critical Illness from COVID-19 Infection.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak that started in Wuhan, Hubei
      province, China in December 2019 has now extended across the globe with >100,000 
      cases and 3,000 deaths reported in 93 countries as of 7 March 2020. We report a
      case of COVID-19 infection in a 64-year-old man who developed rapidly worsening
      respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that required 
      intubation. As the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges widely from mild illness 
      to ARDS with a high risk of mortality, there is a need for more research to
      identify early markers of disease severity. Current evidence suggests that
      patients with advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities or dyspnoea should be
      closely monitored, especially at 1-2 weeks after symptom onset. It remains to be 
      seen if laboratory findings such as lymphopenia or elevated lactate dehydrogenase
      may serve as early surrogates for critical illness or markers of disease
      recovery. Management of ARDS in COVID-19 remains supportive while we await
      results of drug trials. More studies are needed to understand the incidence and
      outcomes of ARDS and critical illness from COVID-19, which will be important for 
      critical care management and resource planning.

TI  - Effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with severe novel coronavirus
      pneumonia: protocol of a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000791 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus outbreak emerged in Wuhan,
      China, and its causative organism has been subsequently designated the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and 
      autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who
      become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract
      symptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to
      subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of
      adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected
      patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and
      warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as
      an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from
      Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to
      an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 
      1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at 
      a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up
      which will be scheduled at 4 consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical
      improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing 
      of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation,
      duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate
      of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The 
      present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in 
      the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the
      management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the
      past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or
      against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients
      with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of 
      severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either
      supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids
      in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2,
      leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. At present,
      there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an
      important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and 
      ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system
      inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe
      pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively
      relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding
      of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang
      (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was
      broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia.
      Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients
      with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and
      might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.

AB  - The recent outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gripped
      the world with apprehension and has evoked a scare of epic proportion regarding
      its potential to spread and infect humans worldwide. As we are in the midst of an
      ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it
      resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the
      outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits
      the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the
      cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 
      in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological 
      tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we
      investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the
      host-virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen
      in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, we debate the
      need for a model for staging COVID-19 based on neurological tissue involvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a 
      novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the
      epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and
      treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with
      suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We
      prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed
      2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were
      obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the
      International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from
      electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients 
      or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were
      also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit
      (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital
      patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. 
      Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had
      underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension
      (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49.0 years
      (IQR 41.0-58.0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood
      market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were
      fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18
      [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache
      (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).
      Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to 
      dyspnoea 8.0 days [IQR 5.0-13.0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All
      41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications
      included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]),
      acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) 
      patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU
      patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10,
      MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFalpha. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused
      clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.
      Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human
      transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

TI  - Compounds with therapeutic potential against novel respiratory 2019 coronavirus.
LID - AAC.00399-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00399-20 [doi]
AB  - Currently, the expansion of the novel human respiratory coronavirus (known as:
      SARS-CoV-2, COVID-2019, or 2019-nCoV) has stressed the need for therapeutic
      alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic. The previous epidemics of
      high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona
      virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could
      be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus
      SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide
      analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. 
      Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures,
      and it displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. In addition, a combination 
      of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors,
      lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-INFb) were shown to be
      effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-INFb also improved clinical
      parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the
      therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of
      LPV/RTV-INFb against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mice model. The
      relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human
      coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, has suggested that
      pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains
      unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics
      that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic 
      infections. This minireview aimed to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds
      that showed potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.

AB  - A new coronavirus outbreak emerged on the 31(st) of December 2019 in Wuhan,
      China, causing commotion among the medical community and the rest of the world.
      This new species of coronavirus has been termed 2019-nCoV and has caused a
      considerable number of cases of infection and deaths in China and, to a growing
      degree, beyond China, becoming a worldwide public health emergency. 2019-nCoV has
      high homology to other pathogenic coronaviruses, such as those originating from
      bat-related zoonosis (SARS-CoV), which caused approximately 646 deaths in China
      at the start of the decade. The mortality rate for 2019-nCoV is not as high
      (approximately 2-3%), but its rapid propagation has resulted in the activation of
      protocols to stop its spread. This pathogen has the potential to become a
      pandemic. It is therefore vital to follow the personal care recommendations
      issued by the World Health Organisation.

LID - 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000270 [doi]
AB  - In late December 2019 a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the
      2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged from Wuhan, China and resulted in a
      formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanding globally, including
      Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, USA, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country
      (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as the
      Severe Specific Contagious Pneumonia (SSCP) in 1/15/2019 and is a notifiable
      communicable disease of the 5 category by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health.
      SSCP is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2-5%)
      mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or
      contact transmission and jeopardized first-line healthcare workers if lack of
      stringent infection control or no proper personal protective equipment available.
      Currently, there is no definite treatment for SSCP although some drugs are under 
      investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading,
      physicians should be aware of travel or contact history for patients with
      compatible symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the 
      epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In 
      this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of
      2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were
      confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic,
      clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed
      up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 
      (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of 
      the patients was 55.5 years (SD 13.1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV
      was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic
      diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),
      cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache
      (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%]
      patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients),
      chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and
      vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients 
      showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and
      ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients
      developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients 
      worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.
      INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely
      to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal
      respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general,
      characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an
      early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further
      investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in
      predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection. FUNDING: National Key
      R&D Program of China.

AB  - The current epidemic situation of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) still
      remained severe. As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious
      Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine
      is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the
      present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National
      Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and
      established an effective treatment strategy centered on "Four-Anti and
      Two-Balance" for clinical practice. The "Four-Anti and Two-Balance"strategy
      included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and
      maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological
      balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was
      recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical
      detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was
      emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest
      positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10%
      patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR
      results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces,
      indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was
      necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial
      liver blood purification system. The "Four-Anti and
      Two-Balance"strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early 
      antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness
      progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed
      antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine
      storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove
      inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe
      balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy 
      in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of
      moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 
      mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen
      therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients
      with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster
      ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis 
      should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with 
      long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT),
      meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with
      COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as
      Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function
      should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of
      prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal
      microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial
      translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore,
      we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also
      integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation
      through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized
      nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained 
      unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, 
      two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular
      following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have
      been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19
      was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of
      prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.

TI  - Real-Time Estimation of the Risk of Death from Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
      Infection: Inference Using Exported Cases.
LID - E523 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020523 [doi]
AB  - The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection that were
      confirmed outside China provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative
      incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in mainland China. Knowledge of
      the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic
      potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential
      growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR 
      and the basic reproduction number-the average number of secondary cases generated
      by a single primary case in a naive population. We modeled epidemic growth either
      from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or 
      using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based
      on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January 2020. The cumulative
      incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% confidence
      interval [CI]: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158),
      respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%,
      7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic
      reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI:
      2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued 
      that the current COVID-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a
      pandemic. The proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using 
      publicly available data.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged 
      recently in Wuhan, China. Information on reported cases strongly indicates
      human-to-human spread, and the most recent information is increasingly indicative
      of sustained human-to-human transmission. While the overall severity profile
      among cases may change as more mild cases are identified, we estimate a risk of
      fatality among hospitalised cases at 14% (95% confidence interval: 3.9-32%).

AB  - The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) is currently, March 2020, affecting
      more than 100000 people worldwide and, according to the WHO (World Health
      Organization), a pandemic is shortly expected. The virus infects the lower
      respiratory tract and causes severe pneumonia and mortality in approximately 10% 
      and 3-5%, respectively, of cases, mainly among the elderly and/or people affected
      by other diseases. AHCC is an alpha-glucan-based standardized mushroom extract
      that has been extensively investigated as an immunostimulant both in animals
      and/or in humans affected by West Nile virus, influenza virus, avian influenza
      virus, hepatitis C virus, papillomavirus, herpes virus, hepatitis B virus and HIV
      by promoting a regulated and protective immune response. Although the efficacy of
      AHCC has not yet been specifically evaluated with respect to SARS-CoV-2 disease, 
      its action in promoting a protective response to a wide range of viral
      infections, and the current absence of effective vaccines, could support its use 
      in the prevention of diseases provoked by human pathogenic coronavirus, including
      COVID-19.

AB  - It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      was reported in Wuhan. So far, COVID-19 has affected 84,503 patients in 57
      countries/territories and caused 2,924 deaths in nine countries. However, the
      epidemiology data differ across countries. Although China had higher morbidity
      and mortality than other sites, the number of new cases per day in China is
      lesser than that outside of China since February 26, 2020. The incidence ranged
      from 61.4 per 1,000,000 people in Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1,000,000
      people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative
      cases/no. of days between the first reported case and February 29, 2020) was
      greatest in China (1,320.85 per day), followed by Republic of Korea (78.78 per
      day), Iran (43.11 per day), and Italy (30.62 per day). However, the DCI in other 
      countries/territories were less than 10 per day. Several effective measures
      including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks,
      extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and at once daily press conference by
      government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan.
      This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of February 29, 2020)
      with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which was much lower than that of nearby 
      countries, such as Republic of Korea and Japan. Additionally, the incidence and
      mortality were correlated with DCI. However, further study and continued
      monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute
      respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan,
      China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is
      scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill
      patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: In this single-centered,
      retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients 
      with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of
      Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan
      26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities,
      treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between 
      survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 
      9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring
      mechanical ventilation. FINDINGS: Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52
      critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 
      59.7 (SD 13.3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%)
      had fever. 32 (61.5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from 
      admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days for
      non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64.6 years
      [11.2] vs 51.9 years [12.9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9
      [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%]
      patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients
      had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute
      kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and
      one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.
      Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13.5%) patients. INTERPRETATION:
      The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is
      considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2
      weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS
      are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great 
      strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not
      adequately staffed or resourced. FUNDING: None.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of the severe or critically
      ill patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), and evaluate the impact
      of complicated myocardial injury on the prognosis of these patients. Methods: A
      retrospective study was conducted in 54 patients who admitted to Tongji hospital 
      from February 3, 2020 to February 24, 2020 and met the criteria of severe or
      critical conditions of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and hospital
      mortality rate were analyzed and compared between the patients with or without
      myocardial injury, which was defined with 3 times higher serum cardiac troponin
      value. Results: The median age of the 54 patients was 68 (59.8, 74.3) years.
      Among all the patients, 24 (44.4%) patients were complicated with hypertension,
      13 (24.1%) with diabetes, 8 (14.8%) with coronary heart disease, and 3 (5.6%)
      with previous cerebral infarction. During hospitalization, 24 (44.4%) of the
      patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26 (48.1%) patients died in 
      hospital. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with
      myocardial injury than in patients without myocardial injury (14 (60.9%) vs. 8
      (25.8%), P=0.013). Moreover, the levels of C-reactive protein (153.6 (80.3,
      240.7) ng/L vs. 49.8 (15.9, 101.9) ng/L) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
      peptide (852.0 (400.0, 2 315.3) ng/L vs. 197.0 (115.3, 631.0) ng/L) were
      significantly higher than patients without myocardial injury (all P<0.01).
      Conclusions: Prevalence of myocardial injury is high among severe or critically
      ill COVID-19 patients. Severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients with myocardial
      injury face a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The study
      suggests that it is important to monitor and manage the myocardial injury during 
      hospitalization for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients.

AB  - An ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei
      province, China at the end of 2019. With the spread of the new coronavirus
      accelerating, person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospitals, and
      intercity spread of 2019-nCoV occurred. At least 40,261 cases confirmed, 23,589
      cases suspected, 909 cases death and 3444 cases cured in China and worldwide 24
      countries confirmed 383 cases being diagnosed, 1 case death in February 10th,
      2020. At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3%, compared with 9.6%
      of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO. It seems the new virus is not as fatal
      as many people thought. Chinese authorities improved surveillance network, made
      the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced
      the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control. More
      comprehensive information is required to understand 2019-nCoV feature, the
      epidemiology of origin and spreading, and the clinical phenomina. According to
      the current status, blocking transmission, isolation, protection, and alternative
      medication are the urgent management strategies against 2019-nCoV.

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2,
      leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. At present,
      there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an
      important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and 
      ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system
      inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe
      pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively
      relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding
      of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang
      (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was
      broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia.
      Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients
      with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and
      might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.

AB  - WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
      related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with
      COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal
      medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown.
      Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully
      selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment
      might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is
      relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. 
      Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious 
      diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, 
      and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while
      adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an
      ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can
      receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this
      procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and
      coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is
      important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is 
      important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and
      respiratory-related mortality.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel
      Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1001/jama.2020.1585 [doi]
AB  - Importance: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia
      (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but
      information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.
      Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. 
      Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of
      the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan
      Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020;
      final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main
      Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory,
      radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of
      critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed
      hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals 
      or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source 
      of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP,
      the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 
      75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the
      presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and 
      hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]),
      fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 
      0.8 x 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients
      (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80
      patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55
      patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy
      shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients
      received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received
      antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%];
      azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six
      patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of
      complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]),
      arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first
      symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS 
      was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not
      treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were
      more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were
      more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] 
      vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen
      therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received
      invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As
      of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality,
      4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged 
      alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). Conclusions
      and Relevance: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients
      with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of
      2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care,
      and mortality was 4.3%.

TI  - Critical care management of adults with community-acquired severe respiratory
      viral infection.
PG  - 315-328
LID - 10.1007/s00134-020-05943-5 [doi]
AB  - With the expanding use of molecular assays, viral pathogens are increasingly
      recognized among critically ill adult patients with community-acquired severe
      respiratory illness; studies have detected respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in
      17-53% of such patients. In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic
      coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019
      nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care
      present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most
      widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that
      early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with
      influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for
      other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been
      studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides,
      corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza 
      immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. 
      Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe
      respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI
      causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a
      high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge
      highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive
      pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe
      RVI. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different
      therapeutics both individually and in combination.
