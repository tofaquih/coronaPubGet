AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;
      previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease
      (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is 
      a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health
      Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been
      identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China.
      On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health
      emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two
      bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 
      and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or 
      direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period
      of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with
      pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), 
      fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement 
      with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography
      images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is
      responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China.
      Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the
      primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep
      monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus
      and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

AB  - In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and
      later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and
      rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world,
      despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the 
      original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic
      information systems and methods, including, among other application
      possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of
      social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using
      population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and
      contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and
      effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and
      describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and
      applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated
      events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications
      are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of
      them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had
      any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support
      the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.

AB  - The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a
      novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
      There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways
      to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine
      design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between
      SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging
      existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the
      experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the
      immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T 
      cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map
      identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these
      identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21
      February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer
      protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a
      population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of 
      epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in
      China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide
      experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the
      2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is
      caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than
      75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than
      2000 deaths worldwide. Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities 
      were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public
      health emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an
      asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults
      represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates,
      children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition,
      nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral
      transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on 
      chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with
      bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with
      underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity
      may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is 
      lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents,
      including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China. Currently, effective
      infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of
      SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last
      week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27
      countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was 
      to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air
      flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou)
      to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated
      passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, 
      an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the 
      direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of
      2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination
      countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city
      reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on 
      the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st
      quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were
      destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The 
      risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the 
      WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, 
      of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia
      (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of
      the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 
      1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV
      transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which
      reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy;
      in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of
      them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of
      transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil
      showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the
      countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31
      January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe
      (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and 
      Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition,
      isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening,
      public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of 
      further spread to naive countries.

AB  - There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and 
      spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was
      transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei
      province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date
      (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected
      droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are
      usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others.
      The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with
      comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case
      fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration
      of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common
      laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated
      C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually
      abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially
      supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails
      home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict
      infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet
      precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. 
      The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.

      emergencies: reflections on the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in China.
PG  - 3-8

AB  - On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced an outbreak
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), China is now at 
      a critical period in the control of the epidemic. The Chinese Government has been
      taking a series of rapid, comprehensive, and effective prevention and control
      measures. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a
      serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage 
      of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing.
      This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention
      and control. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to
      quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and 
      it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the
      emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and
      there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency
      medical supplies. A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the 
      management of public health emergencies. Based on international experiences with 
      pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency
      reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public
      health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of
      international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies
      of international concern in the future.

      virtual screening reveals velpatasvir, ledipasvir, and other drug repurposing
      candidates.

AB  - We prepared the three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 (aka 2019-nCoV) 3C-like
      protease (3CL (pro)) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96%
      identity) ortholog from the SARS-CoV. All residues involved in the catalysis,
      substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the
      polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C-like cleavage sites on
      the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical
      substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that 
      some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV
      enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. With the 3CL (pro)
      molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and
      proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir 
      or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new
      coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache. The drugs
      Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be
      very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes.

AB  - An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2,
      previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
      spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020,
      World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a
      public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2,
      since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third
      introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the
      human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of
      87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of
      China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several
      independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to
      beta-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to
      bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads
      through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed
      sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the 
      globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue
      and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. 
      The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and 
      prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific
      antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed 
      drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest
      research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics
      of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to
      combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2)
      causing a cluster of respiratory infections (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) 
      in Wuhan, China, was identified on 7 January 2020. The epidemic quickly
      disseminated from Wuhan and as at 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been
      confirmed in 25 countries, including 1,116 deaths. Strengthened surveillance was 
      implemented in France on 10 January 2020 in order to identify imported cases
      early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of risk exposure and
      follow-up procedure were defined for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were
      confirmed on 24 January, the first cases in Europe. Contact tracing was
      immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as at low risk of exposure
      and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been
      discharged and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no 
      secondary transmission has been identified. Effective collaboration between all
      parties involved in the surveillance and response to emerging threats is required
      to detect imported cases early and to implement adequate control measures.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and then spread rapidly worldwide, 
      particularly to China, Japan, and South Korea. Scientists are endeavoring to find
      antivirals specific to the virus. Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol,
      remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test
      their efficacy and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      in China; some promising results have been achieved thus far. This article
      summarizes agents with potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The
      virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by
      the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with
      SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from
      asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, 
      which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides 
      an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just
      crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 
      largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery,
      zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
      in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with
      SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human 
      coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency
      viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a
      proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses,
      their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes.
      Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host
      antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are 
      also discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in
      December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health
      agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. METHODS:
      Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2
      test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after
      the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring
      for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough,
      or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for
      SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel
      contacts were also tested. FINDINGS: Patient 1-a woman in her 60s-returned from
      China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia
      and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but
      had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347
      underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195
      health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under
      investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and
      all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
      INTERPRETATION: Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two 
      people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic.
      Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some
      asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected. FUNDING: None.

AB  - Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of a new infectious 
      disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
      The clinical features include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and
      inflammatory lung infiltration. China rapidly listed SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia
      as a statutory infectious disease. To standardize the diagnosis and treatment of 
      this new infectious disease, an operational recommendation for the diagnosis and 
      management of SARS-CoV-2 infection is developed by Peking Union Medical College
      Hospital.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Following the public-health emergency of international concern
      (PHEIC) declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and
      the recent outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [officially
      renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] in China
      and 29 other countries, we aimed to summarise the clinical aspects of the
      novelBetacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its possible clinical presentations
      together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require
      antimicrobial treatment. METHODS: The currently available literature was reviewed
      for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time
      of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed
      database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included 'novel coronavirus' or
      '2019-nCoV' or 'COVID-19'. RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age
      range, 8-92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were 
      commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were
      surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series
      available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral
      lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass
      opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at
      least in the early phases of the disease. CONCLUSION: The new 2019-nCoV epidemic 
      is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs.
      However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory
      co-morbidities.

AB  - The world is currently witnessing an outbreak of a new coronavirus spreading
      quickly across China and affecting at least 24 other countries. With almost
      65,000 infected, a worldwide death toll of at least 1370 (as of 14 February
      2020), and with the potential to affect up to two-thirds of the world population,
      COVID-19 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global
      health emergency. The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as 
      Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494
      laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002-2003
      epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases.
      Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral
      infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their
      transmissibility. It is likely that these differences in infectivity of
      coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their
      shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic 
      disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.

      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019
      which causes coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory disease
      marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human
      population in the twenty-first century. This recent emergence of a previously
      unknown coronavirus in China leads to huge impacts on humans globally. Covid-19
      is a challenge to global public health. Here, we discuss the COVID-19 outbreak in
      a one health context, highlighting the need for the implementation of one health 
      measures and practices to improve human health and reduce the emergence of
      pandemic viruses.

AB  - Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite
      drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is 
      the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by
      pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities
      have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the
      search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In
      the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a
      public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of
      chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was
      previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including
      SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of
      COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we
      discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2
      replication cycle.

AB  - Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as
      SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However,
      there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug
      repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing
      drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug
      discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing
      methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, 
      quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in
      the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV
      whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide
      sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and
      nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved
      regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared 
      to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host
      interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV
      repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are
      further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced
      transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential
      drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus
      melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the "Complementary Exposure"
      pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target
      separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study
      offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate
      repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting
      2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus, later named as severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still gradually spreading worldwide. The 
      nucleic acid test or genetic sequencing serves as the gold standard method for
      confirmation of infection, yet several recent studies have reported
      false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
      reaction (rRT-PCR). Here, we report two representative false-negative cases and
      discuss the supplementary role of clinical data with rRT-PCR, including
      laboratory examination results and computed tomography features. Coinfection with
      SARS-COV-2 and other viruses has been discussed as well.

AB  - Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens
      including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 
      and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease
      condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the
      third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The
      continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant
      threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research
      on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to
      treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective 
      vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several
      clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV
      infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help
      scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and
      develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this
      infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for
      passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential
      of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many
      diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic 
      intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the
      neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and
      MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate
      therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging
      pathogen.

TI  - The Effects of Social Support on Sleep Quality of Medical Staff Treating Patients
      with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January and February 2020 in China.
PG  - e923549

AB  - BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China.
      Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine
      the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study 
      aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and 
      function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and
      February 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS A one-month cross-sectional
      observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19
      infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social
      support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the
      General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR)
      questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support 
      Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis and SEM
      identified the interactions between these factors. RESULTS Levels of social
      support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and
      sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress.
      Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which 
      negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality. Anxiety, stress, and
      self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep
      quality. CONCLUSIONS SEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating
      patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of
      anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy that were dependent on sleep quality and
      social support.

TI  - An Analysis of 38 Pregnant Women with COVID-19, Their Newborn Infants, and
      Maternal-Fetal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: Maternal Coronavirus Infections and
      Pregnancy Outcomes.
LID - 10.5858/arpa.2020-0901-SA [doi]
AB  - The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially
      life-threating respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly
      spread across the globe creating a massive public health problem. Previous
      epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor
      obstetrical outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal
      transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death. This communication
      reviews the effects of two previous coronavirus infections - severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory
      syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV - on pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it
      analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns
      in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including
      clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus
      from mother to fetus. This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of
      pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did
      not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS
      and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of
      SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens
      tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for
      SARS-CoV-2. At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is
      no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission
      from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Analysis of additional cases is
      necessary to determine if this remains true.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of
      an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, now named COVID-19. Most cases and
      sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been
      reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy. Since the symptoms are
      similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers
      arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common 
      infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.

AB  - In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, identified a cluster of
      pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology linked to the city's South China Seafood
      Market. Subsequent investigations revealed a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as
      the causative agent now at the heart of a major outbreak. The rising case numbers
      have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action, including the
      wholesale isolation of Wuhan. Alongside this has been a robust scientific
      response, including early publication of the pathogen genome, and rapid
      development of highly specific diagnostics. This article will review the new
      knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 acute respiratory disease, and summarise its
      clinical features.

AB  - As of 28 February 2020, Italy had 888 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with most
      cases in Northern Italy in the Lombardia and Veneto regions. Travel-related cases
      were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current
      epidemic in Italy. The month of February, however, has been dominated by two
      large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local 
      transmission the source of infections. Contact tracing has failed to identify
      patient zero in one of the outbreaks. As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of
      COVID-19 have died. Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are
      identical at 2.3. Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with
      fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities. It will be important
      to develop point-of-care devices to aid clinicians in stratifying elderly
      patients as early as possible to determine the potential level of care they will 
      require to improve their chances of survival from COVID-19 disease.

AB  - The need for timely establishment of diagnostic assays arose when Germany was
      confronted with the first travel-associated outbreak of severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Europe. We describe our laboratory
      experiences during a large contact tracing investigation, comparing previously
      published real-time RT-PCR assays in different PCR systems and a commercial kit. 
      We found that assay performance using the same primers and probes with different 
      PCR systems varied and the commercial kit performed well.

AB  - As of February 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      outbreak started in China in December 2019 has been spreading in many countries
      in the world. With the numbers of confirmed cases are increasing, information on 
      the epidemiologic investigation and clinical manifestation have been accumulated.
      However, data on viral load kinetics in confirmed cases are lacking. Here, we
      present the viral load kinetics of the first two confirmed patients with mild to 
      moderate illnesses in Korea in whom distinct viral load kinetics are shown. This 
      report suggests that viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 may be different from that
      of previously reported other coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV.

AB  - Facing the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2), high-volume respiratory testing is demanded in laboratories
      worldwide. We evaluated the performance of a molecular assay for the detection of
      SARS-CoV-2 on a high-throughput platform, the cobas 6800, using the 'open
      channel' for integration of a laboratory-developed assay. We observed good
      analytical performance in clinical specimens. The fully automated workflow
      enables high-throughput testing with minimal hands-on time, while offering fast
      and reliable results.

TI  - Imaging and clinical features of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-020-04735-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also 
      called 2019-nCoV) recently break out in Wuhan, China, and was named as COVID-19. 
      With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other
      regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of 
      these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: All
      patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4,
      2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). This
      analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age
      range, 18-86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent
      non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical
      characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics,
      pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In
      addition, after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were
      evaluated to assess radiological evolution. FINDINGS: The majority of infected
      patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly
      presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented
      bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%)
      patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19
      pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 
      (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%),
      adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55
      (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon 
      findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21
      patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the 
      second CT after 3-4 days. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based
      on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and
      laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial
      diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass
      opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical
      chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.

      of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

AB  - The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in
      December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly to over a dozen countries.
      Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries.
      This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via
      respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through
      surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically,
      there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even
      before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost,
      easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed.
      Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based
      assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via
      pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This
      protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we
      tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less 
      than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to 
      be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for
      early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories
      that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly developed protocol should be
      helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further
      prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly
      propagating virus.

TI  - Analyzing the epidemiological outbreak of COVID-19: A visual exploratory data
      analysis approach.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25743 [doi]
AB  - There is an obvious concern globally regarding the fact about the emerging
      coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a worldwide public health
      threat. As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly
      available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational
      awareness and intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China,
      caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the
      epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting 
      people all around the globe. In this study, we present an effort to compile and
      analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID-19 based on the several
      open datasets on 2019-nCoV provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health
      Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health 
      Commission, and DXY. An exploratory data analysis with visualizations has been
      made to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, and 
      recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China. Overall, at the 
      outset of an outbreak like this, it is highly important to readily provide
      information to begin the evaluation necessary to understand the risks and begin
      containment activities.

AB  - The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused a large number of
      deaths with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, especially in East Asia. This
      study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also,
      interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding major
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I supertype representatives prevalent in
      China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL
      epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes
      in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes
      were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple
      contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating
      their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes
      can be potential candidates for the development of 2019-nCoV vaccines.

AB  - In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei
      Province; and then named "2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)" by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced
      respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it
      attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the
      request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV
      infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be
      developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice
      guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also
      added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
      This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological
      characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis,
      treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial
      infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover,
      we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe
      2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for
      2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first
      frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections,
      community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person 
      who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To describe the infection control preparedness for Coronavirus
      Disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 [previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus]
      in the first 42 days after announcement of a cluster of pneumonia in China, on 31
      December 2019 (day 1) in Hong Kong. METHODS: A bundle approach of active and
      enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid
      molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers (HCWs)
      with unprotected exposure in the hospitals was implemented. Epidemiological
      characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental and air samples were collected 
      and analyzed. RESULTS: From day 1 to day 42, forty-two (3.3%) of 1275 patients
      fulfilling active (n=29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n=13) confirmed to
      have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The number of locally acquired case significantly
      increased from 1 (7.7%) of 13 [day 22 to day 32] to 27 (93.1%) of 29 confirmed
      case [day 33 to day 42] (p<0.001). Twenty-eight patients (66.6%) came from 8
      family clusters. Eleven (2.7%) of 413 HCWs caring these confirmed cases were
      found to have unprotected exposure requiring quarantine for 14 days. None of them
      was infected and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed.
      Environmental surveillance performed in a patient with viral load of 3.3x106
      copies/ml (pooled nasopharyngeal/ throat swab) and 5.9x106 copies/ml (saliva)
      respectively. SARS-CoV-2 revealed in 1 (7.7%) of 13 environmental samples, but
      not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from patient's chin with or
      without wearing a surgical mask. CONCLUSION: Appropriate hospital infection
      control measures could prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

      travel-related cases, and vaccine readiness.
PG  - 3-17
LID - 10.3855/jidc.12425 [doi]
AB  - On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical
      pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The 
      first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019.
      Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to
      bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500
      laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV,
      infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been
      confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including
      Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United
      States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has
      also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one
      provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of
      infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is 
      now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been
      infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions
      that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission?
      What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the
      vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection
      against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the
      generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in
      gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic
      development. Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at

AB  - The emergence of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has awakened the echoes of
      SARS-CoV from nearly two decades ago. Yet, with technological advances and
      important lessons gained from previous outbreaks, perhaps the world is better
      equipped to deal with the most recent emergent group 2B coronavirus.

AB  - A new type of coronavirus, i.e. se-vere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2; formerly known as 2019-nCoV) appeared in December 2019 in the
      province of Hubei, China, and over the past four months the number of cases of
      infection has exceeded 240,000 worldwide, leading to a pandemia [1]. At the
      genetic level, 2019-nCoV is closely related to the SARS-CoV and, to a lesser
      extent, to MERS-CoV, which appeared as epidemiological threats in recent years in
      China and the Middle East, respectively. Infections with the Coronaviridae virus 
      family in a small percentage of patients, especially in those over 60 years of
      age with a positive clinical history, lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome
      [2].

AB  - The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan,
      Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to
      China's public health and clinical treatment. The virus belongs to the beta genus
      Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and 
      MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through 
      droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period
      could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current
      observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger
      transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related 
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor 
      SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot
      of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents,
      identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may
      inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of
      2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic
      coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and 
      control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general
      population. However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate
      the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. METHODS: Clinical
      records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for
      55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab 
      samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital
      of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020. RESULTS: All 55 
      patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%)
      patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
      Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including
      fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive
      lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56x10(9) cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia
      (from 4.5 to 18.28x10(9) cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented
      normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated
      patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus.
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was
      currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific 
      clinical characteristics to distinguish them.

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak
      of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China,
      which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention
      around the world. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral
      drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the
      novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate
      their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential 
      drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and
      therapeutic countermeasures. Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features,
      including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention
      and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia that
      started in Wuhan, China. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88
      confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we 
      estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval:
      5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These
      values should help inform 2019-nCoV case definitions and appropriate quarantine
      durations.

      resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic
      reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and
      suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by
      other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned
      from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: The basic
      reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on
      the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall
      between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from
      international colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: The early transmission ability of
      2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease 
      with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are
      needed to prevent the further transmissions.

AB  - Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia.
      We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% 
      high density interval: 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained
      human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar
      magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
      pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and
      reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health
      concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and 
      clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      data on the global outbreak of "2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV" were obtained 
      from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
      (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the
      information from research documents published in global scientific journals
      indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological 
      and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS:
      Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916
      (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27
      states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April
      2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly
      the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 
      (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The
      fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) 
      and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison
      to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has
      diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious
      than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period
      compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was
      higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in
      coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills,
      cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea,
      confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take
      immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging
      pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.25700 [doi]
AB  - There is a rising global concern for the recently emerged novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV). Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide
      scientific community in the last few weeks to understand the evolutionary origin 
      and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic 
      information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including
      also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and
      severe acute respiratory syndrome. We confirm high sequence similarity (>99%)
      between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV
      sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic
      origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we
      could identify at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots, one of which is
      responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein.
      Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae,
      identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies
      deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.

AB  - We report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in travellers from
      Wuhan, China to Thailand. Both were independent introductions on separate
      flights, discovered with thermoscanners and confirmed with RT-PCR and genome
      sequencing. Both cases do not seem directly linked to the Huanan Seafood Market
      in Hubei but the viral genomes are identical to four other sequences from Wuhan, 
      suggesting early spread within the city already in the first week of January.

TI  - Composition and divergence of coronavirus spike proteins and host ACE2 receptors 
      predict potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25726 [doi]
AB  - From the beginning of 2002 and 2012, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) crossed
      the species barriers to infect humans, causing thousands of infections and
      hundreds of deaths, respectively. Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2),
      which has become the cause of the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019
      (COVID-19), was discovered. Until 18 February 2020, there were 72 533 confirmed
      COVID-19 cases (including 10 644 severe cases) and 1872 deaths in China.
      SARS-CoV-2 is spreading among the public and causing substantial burden due to
      its human-to-human transmission. However, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is 
      still unclear. Finding the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative
      to prevent further spread of the epidemic. In this study, we used systematic
      comparison and analysis to predict the interaction between the receptor-binding
      domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike protein and the host receptor,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interaction between the key amino
      acids of S protein RBD and ACE2 indicated that, other than pangolins and snakes, 
      as previously suggested, turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii, Chelonia mydas, and
      Pelodiscus sinensis) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting
      SARS-CoV-2 to humans.

AB  - The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) from the Hubei province in China in late 2019 demonstrates the
      epidemic potential of coronaviruses. The rapid spread of this virus across the
      world in only 2 months highlights the transmissibility of this family of viruses 
      and the significant morbidity and mortality that they can cause. We highlight the
      current state of knowledge of coronavirus biology while answering questions
      concerning the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BackgroundThe chest CT findings of patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have not previously been described in detail.PurposeTo
      investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV 
      pneumonia in humans.Materials and MethodsFifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women;
      age range 16-76 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using
      real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section 
      CT. The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were
      evaluated.ResultsFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with
      individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and
      cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal
      white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and
      either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count. CT
      images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO 
      with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. 
      GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure
      consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%)
      patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the
      posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more
      consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT
      scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P < .001).
      Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those
      aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P < .001). Follow-up CT in 13
      patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%)
      patients.ConclusionPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous
      ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, 
      combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic
      exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      pneumonia.(c) RSNA, 2020.

TI  - Drug treatment options for the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

AB  - As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) have been reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China.
      At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal
      coronavirus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible
      is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Three general methods,
      which include existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs using standard assays,
      screening of a chemical library containing many existing compounds or databases, 
      and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical
      understanding of individual coronaviruses, are used to discover the potential
      antiviral treatment of human pathogen coronavirus. Lopinavir /Ritonavir,
      Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1),
      abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs
      (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such
      ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment
      options for 2019-nCoV. However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- 
      nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments.

LID - 10.3201/eid2607.200250 [doi]
AB  - Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection
      exported from mainland China could lead to self-sustained outbreaks in other
      countries. By February 2020, several countries were reporting imported SARS-CoV-2
      cases. To contain the virus, early detection of imported SARS-CoV-2 cases is
      critical. We used air travel volume estimates from Wuhan, China, to international
      destinations and a generalized linear regression model to identify locations that
      could have undetected imported cases. Our model can be adjusted to account for
      exportation of cases from other locations as the virus spreads and more
      information on importations and transmission becomes available. Early detection
      and appropriate control measures can reduce the risk for transmission in all
      locations.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has significant implications for
      the cardiovascular care of patients. First, those with COVID-19 and preexisting
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an increased risk of severe disease and death. 
      Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect
      cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis,
      arrhythmias and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for 
      COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects. Fourth, the response to COVID-19
      can compromise the rapid triage of non-COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular
      conditions. Finally, the provision of cardiovascular care may place health care
      workers in a position of vulnerability as they become host or vectors of virus
      transmission. We hereby review the peer-reviewed and preprint literature
      pertaining to cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 and highlight
      gaps in knowledge that require further study pertinent to patients, health care
      workers, and health systems.

TI  - Protein Structure and Sequence Reanalysis of 2019-nCoV Genome Refutes Snakes as
      Its Intermediate Host and the Unique Similarity between Its Spike Protein
      Insertions and HIV-1.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00129 [doi]
AB  - As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global
      pneumonia epidemic, the careful analysis of its transmission and cellular
      mechanisms is sorely needed. In this Communication, we first analyzed two recent 
      studies that concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and
      that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions share a unique similarity to HIV-1.
      However, the reimplementation of the analyses, built on larger scale data sets
      using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, presents clear
      evidence that rebuts these conclusions. Next, using metagenomic samples from
      Manis javanica, we assembled a draft genome of the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus,
      which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019-nCoV genome. In
      particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding
      domain revealed four times more variations in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than in 
      the Manis coronavirus compared with 2019-nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a
      missing link in the transmission of 2019-nCoV from bats to human.

AB  - A new type of coronavirus, i.e. se-vere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2; formerly known as 2019-nCoV) appeared in December 2019 in the
      province of Hubei, China, and over the past four months the number of cases of
      infection has exceeded 240,000 worldwide, leading to a pandemia [1]. At the
      genetic level, 2019-nCoV is closely related to the SARS-CoV and, to a lesser
      extent, to MERS-CoV, which appeared as epidemiological threats in recent years in
      China and the Middle East, respectively. Infections with the Coronaviridae virus 
      family in a small percentage of patients, especially in those over 60 years of
      age with a positive clinical history, lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome
      [2].

TI  - Rapid Progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Review of Current
      Understanding of Critical Illness from COVID-19 Infection.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak that started in Wuhan, Hubei
      province, China in December 2019 has now extended across the globe with >100,000 
      cases and 3,000 deaths reported in 93 countries as of 7 March 2020. We report a
      case of COVID-19 infection in a 64-year-old man who developed rapidly worsening
      respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that required 
      intubation. As the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges widely from mild illness 
      to ARDS with a high risk of mortality, there is a need for more research to
      identify early markers of disease severity. Current evidence suggests that
      patients with advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities or dyspnoea should be
      closely monitored, especially at 1-2 weeks after symptom onset. It remains to be 
      seen if laboratory findings such as lymphopenia or elevated lactate dehydrogenase
      may serve as early surrogates for critical illness or markers of disease
      recovery. Management of ARDS in COVID-19 remains supportive while we await
      results of drug trials. More studies are needed to understand the incidence and
      outcomes of ARDS and critical illness from COVID-19, which will be important for 
      critical care management and resource planning.

AB  - A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) highlighted at the end of 2019 in China is
      spreading across all continents. Most often at the origin of a mild infectious
      syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible
      digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious
      pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death.Data on the consequences during
      pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the
      symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There
      are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns
      infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal
      transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns
      of infected mothers have been described.Pregnancy is known as a period at higher 
      risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it
      seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor
      closely pregnant women.In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the
      societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have
      proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of
      SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women. These proposals may evolve on a daily basis with 
      the advancement of the epidemic and knowledge in pregnant women. Subsequently, an
      in-depth analysis of cases in pregnant women will be necessary in order to
      improve knowledge on the subject.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the newly identified human coronavirus causing severe pneumonia
      epidemic, was probably originated from Chinese horseshoe bats. However, direct
      transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct
      contact, implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts. Angiotensin
      converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of
      certain species can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated and ranked the 
      receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic
      clustering and sequence alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by
      SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of
      various mammals, except murines, and some birds, such as pigeon. This prediction 
      may help to screen the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      was reported in Wuhan. So far, COVID-19 has affected 84,503 patients in 57
      countries/territories and caused 2,924 deaths in nine countries. However, the
      epidemiology data differ across countries. Although China had higher morbidity
      and mortality than other sites, the number of new cases per day in China is
      lesser than that outside of China since February 26, 2020. The incidence ranged
      from 61.4 per 1,000,000 people in Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1,000,000
      people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative
      cases/no. of days between the first reported case and February 29, 2020) was
      greatest in China (1,320.85 per day), followed by Republic of Korea (78.78 per
      day), Iran (43.11 per day), and Italy (30.62 per day). However, the DCI in other 
      countries/territories were less than 10 per day. Several effective measures
      including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks,
      extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and at once daily press conference by
      government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan.
      This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of February 29, 2020)
      with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which was much lower than that of nearby 
      countries, such as Republic of Korea and Japan. Additionally, the incidence and
      mortality were correlated with DCI. However, further study and continued
      monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.

AB  - The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causing novel
      coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP), has affected the lives of 71,429 people
      globally. Originating in China, the disease has a rapid progression to other
      countries. Research suggests remarkable genomic resemblance of 2019-nCoV with
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which has a history of a pandemic in
      2002. With evidence of nosocomial spread, a number of diligent measures are being
      employed to constrain its propagation. Hence, the Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern (PHEIC) has been established by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) with strategic objectives for public health to curtail its
      impact on global health and economy.

AB  - The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
      China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I
      converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human
      cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, 
      kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.
      SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate 
      the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single
      cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and
      analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus
      receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, 
      we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte,
      colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach
      epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the
      candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with
      ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and
      ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs,
      suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted 
      "CellPhoneDB" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and
      their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages
      frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis
      signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense
      and immune pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel form of Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan has created a
      confused and rapidly evolving situation. In this situational framework, patients 
      and front-line healthcare workers are vulnerable. METHOD: Studies were identified
      using large-circulation international journals found in two electronic databases:
      Scopus and Embase. RESULTS: Populations of patients that may require tailored
      interventions are older adults and international migrant workers. Older adults
      with psychiatric conditions may be experiencing further distress. The COVID-19
      epidemic has underscored potential gaps in mental health services during
      emergencies. CONCLUSIONS: Most health professionals working in isolation units
      and hospitals do not receive any training for providing mental health care. Fear 
      seems more certainly a consequence of mass quarantine.

TI  - Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of
      International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are 
      essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks,
      as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the
      outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review
      existing health security capacities against public health risks and events.
      METHODS: We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR)
      tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) 
      prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational
      readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised
      countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the
      lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data 
      at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 
      countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had
      response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities
      and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these
      countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the
      detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an
      effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including
      infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102
      (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 
      (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2),
      and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control 
      an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at
      level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to
      prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have
      strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an
      effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to
      COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand
      national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and
      collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for
      outbreak control. FUNDING: None.

AB  - Abstract: Since 2003, coronavirus has caused multiple major public health events 
      that resulted in global epidemics such as, severe acute respiratory syndrome
      SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS and corona virus disease 2019
      COVID-19. Especially since COVID-19 has outbroken in Wuhan, Hubei, in December
      2019, coronavirus has had a significant impact on people's health and lives. But 
      so far, the pathological diagnosis of COVID-19 has been relatively deficient it
      is still confined to the pathological findings of punctured organs, and the
      majority of medical workers have poor awareness of its pathological
      characteristics. The COVID-19, as same as SARS and MERS, is caused by
      coronaviruses and can cause viral pneumonia. They have certain similarities. This
      article comprehensively reviews the pathological features observed in the
      autopsies of the aforementioned three diseases, in order to provide reference to 
      the analysis of pathological changes of COVID-19.

AB  - In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) emerged in
      Wuhan, Hubei, and spread rapidly to China and over 100 countries around the
      world. The lung injury and repair caused by COVID-19 has many similarities with
      the onset and progression of interstitial lung disease (ILD) . Therefore, it is
      difficult to distinguish between COVID-19 and some types of new-onset ILD or
      other causes leading to acute exacerbation of ILD. Clinicians need to
      comprehensively analyze the epidemic history, disease onset characteristics,
      clinical manifestations, image characteristics, serological andpathogenic
      microorganism test results to confirm diagnosis. Because of this, the article
      will discuss the issues related to the differential diagnosis and management of
      COVID-19 and ILD, and try to provide reasonable suggestions.

TI  - Clinical Features and Treatment of COVID-19 Patients in Northeast Chongqing.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS CoV-2) that
      began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health.
      This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper
      understanding of this new infectious disease. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical 
      features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and
      clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and
      analyzed in this study. RESULTS: A total of 135 hospitalized patients with
      COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (IQR 36-55), and there was no
      significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact
      with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying
      disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular
      disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever
      (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest CT scans
      showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all of
      the patients. All of the patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%] (Kaletra
      and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and
      corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional
      Chinese medicine (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive
      Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of western and Chinese
      medicine. Compared with the mild cases, the severe cases had lower lymphocyte
      counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, D-dimer, LDH, PCT, ALB, CRP, and
      AST. CONCLUSION: In this study, the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19
      patients were demonstrated. Kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine played an
      important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are
      required to explore the role of Kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine in the
      treatment of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Prepare to adapt: Blood supply and transfusion support during the first 2 weeks
      of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affecting Washington State.
LID - 10.1111/trf.15789 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first coronavirus (COVID-19) case was reported in United States
      (US), in the state of Washington, approximately three months after the outbreak
      in Wuhan, China. Three weeks later, the US federal government declared the
      pandemic a national emergency. The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases
      increased rather rapidly and changed routine daily activities of the community.
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This brief report describes the response from the
      hospital, the regional blood center, and the hospital-based transfusion services 
      to the events that took place in the community during the initial phases of the
      pandemic. RESULTS: In Washington State, the first week of March started with 4
      confirmed cases and ended with 150; by the end of the second week of March there 
      were more than 700 cases of confirmed COVID-19. During the first week, blood
      donations dropped significantly. Blood units provided from blood centers of
      non-affected areas of the country helped keep inventory stable and allow for
      routine hospital operations. The hospital-based transfusion service began
      prospective triaging of blood orders to monitor and prioritize blood utilization.
      In the second week, blood donations recovered, and the hospital postponed
      elective procedures to ensure staff and personal protective equipment were
      appropriate for the care of critical patients. CONCLUSION: As community
      activities are disrupted and hospital activities switch from routine operations
      to pandemic-focused and urgent care-oriented, the blood supply and utilization
      requires a number of transformations.

TI  - 2019 novel Coronavirus outbreak: a quiz or final exam?
LID - 10.1007/s11684-020-0753-1 [doi]
AB  - The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen and is threatening
      the global health. Strikingly, more than 28 000 cases and 550 deaths have been
      reported within two months from disease emergence. Armed with experience from
      previous epidemics in the last two decades, clinicians, scientists, officials,
      and citizens in China are all contributing to the prevention of further 2019-nCoV
      transmission. Efficient preliminary work has enabled us to understand the basic
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV, but there are still many unanswered questions. It
      is too early now to judge our performance in this outbreak. Continuous and
      strengthened efforts should be made not only during the epidemic, but also
      afterwards in order to prepare for any incoming challenges.

TI  - Profiling Early Humoral Response to Diagnose Novel Coronavirus Disease
      (COVID-19).
LID - ciaa310 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major
      healthcare threat. Current method of detection involves qPCR-based technique,
      which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity.
      False negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected
      patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission. We here
      aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019
      novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to 
      diagnose COVID-19. METHODS: The host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2
      including IgA, IgM and IgG response were examined by using an ELISA based assay
      on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein. Total 208 plasma samples were
      collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases (qPCR negative but had typical 
      manifestation). The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort.
      RESULTS: The median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection were 5 days (IQR
      3-6), while IgG was detected on 14 days (IQR 10-18) after symptom onset, with a
      positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7% and 77.9% respectively. In confirmed and probable
      cases, the positive rates of IgM antibodies were 75.6% and 93.1%, respectively.
      The detection efficiency by IgM ELISA is higher than that of qPCR method after
      5.5 days of symptom onset. The positive detection rate is significantly increased
      (98.6%) when combined IgM ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compare with a
      single qPCR test (51.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid to 
      the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) outbreak in
      Wuhan, China, has now spread to many countries across the world including the UK 
      with over 3000 deaths as of early March 2020. This will inevitably lead to an
      increase in the number of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related
      deaths at autopsy. The Royal College of Pathologists has responded to this
      concern with the release of guidelines on autopsy practice relating to COVID-19. 
      The following article is a summary and interpretation of these guidelines. It
      includes a description of hazard group 3 organisms to which SARS-CoV-2 has been
      assigned, a brief description of what is currently known about the pathological
      and autopsy findings in COVID-19, a summary of the recommendations for conducting
      autopsies in suspected COVID-19 cases and the techniques for making the diagnosis
      at autopsy. It concludes by considering the clinicopathological correlation and
      notification of such cases.

TI  - Practical laboratory considerations amidst the COVID-19 outbreak: early
      experience from Singapore.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a zoonotic viral infection originating
      from Wuhan, China in December 2019. The World Health Organization has classified 
      this pandemic as a global health emergency due to its virulent nature of
      transmission, which may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Singapore's 
      health ministry has responded with enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 for all
      suspected pneumonia cases, further increasing the volume of testing via real-time
      reverse transcription PCR, as well as samples necessitating stringent infectious 
      control. Collectively, this has implications on the total testing process,
      laboratory operations and its personnel due to biosafety concerns. Turnaround
      time for routine testing may also be affected. The aim of this article is to
      present our tertiary institution's early experience with managing this emerging
      crisis and offer practical considerations for the preanalytical, analytical and
      postanalytical phases of laboratory testing in this cohort of patients.

AB  - Patients with COVID-19 infection are at risk of acute respiratory disease
      syndrome (ARDS) and death. The tissue receptor for COVID-19 is ACE2, and higher
      levels of ACE2 can protect against ARDS. Angiotensin receptor blockers and
      statins upregulate ACE2. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether this
      drug combination might be used to treat patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified 
      on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting 
      in 6,284 cases including 42 deaths as of March 6, 2020. To examine the growth
      rate of the outbreak, we aimed to present the first study to report the
      reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS: The daily confirmed
      cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. 
      By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the
      generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on
      the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval. RESULTS: We 
      identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% 
      CI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95%
      CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI:
      0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case
      fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and
      increases with older age. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate early sustained
      transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social 
      distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.

AB  - In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health and health Commission (Hubei
      Province, China) reported a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology. On 
      January 7, 2020, the Chinese authorities identified as a causative agent of the
      outbreak a new type of virus of the Coronaviridiae family, called SARS-CoV-2.
      Since then, thounsands of cases have been reported with global dissemination.
      Infections in humans cause a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild upper
      respiratory tract infection, to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and
      sepsis. There is not specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2, which is why the
      fundamental aspects are to establish adequate prevention measures and support
      treatment and management of complications.

AB  - An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in the city of Wuhan in China and has widely
      spread worldwide. Currently, it is vital to explore potential intermediate hosts 
      of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we reinvestigated published 
      data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-CoV-like CoVs were detected by
      Liu et al. [1]. We found genomic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a
      SARS-CoV-2-like CoV (named Pangolin-CoV) in dead Malayan pangolins. Pangolin-CoV 
      is 91.02% and 90.55% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively, at 
      the whole-genome level. Aside from RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV is the most closely
      related CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely
      related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in
      the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV
      and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both
      Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at
      S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2. Conclusively, this
      study suggests that pangolin species are a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like
      CoVs.

AB  - Following the outbreak in China, the Lombardy region of Italy has become one of
      the areas of highest incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). As the outbreak grew to a pandemic, many centres worldwide raised
      the concern that immunocompromised patients may be at high risk of developing a
      severe respiratory disease called COVID-19. Unlike common viral agents (such as
      Adenovirus, Rhinovirus, Norovirus, Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus),
      Coronaviruses have not shown to cause a more severe disease in immunosuppressed
      patients. For this family of viruses the host innate immune response appears the 
      main driver of lung tissue damage during infection.

TI  - The clinical characteristics of pneumonia patients co-infected with 2019 novel
      coronavirus and influenza virus in Wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25781 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection emerged in Wuhan,
      China on December 2019. Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has
      been spreading quickly and many countries and territories have been affected,
      with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Influenza virus has
      been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia. It was
      found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and
      influenza virus. 5 out of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also
      diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and 
      two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical
      characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19 as well as
      influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (5 [100%]
      patients), Cough (5 [100%] patients), shortness of breath (5 [100%] patients),
      nasal tampon (3 [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (3 [60%] patients), myalgia (2
      [40%] patients), fatigue (2 [40%] patients), headache (2 [40%] patients), and
      expectoration (2 [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to 
      the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (4 [80%] patients), and
      liver function ALT and AST (2 [40%] patients, 2 [40%] patients) and C-reactive
      protein (4 [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital. They stayed 
      in hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4+/-7.02), respectively. The main
      complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1
      [20%] patients), acute liver injury (3 [60%] patients), and diarrhea (2 [40%]
      patients). All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir),
      oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics. Three patients were treated with
      glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five 
      patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all
      patients did not need ICU care and were discharged from hospital without death.
      In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection
      did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory
      findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical
      characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only. However, it is
      worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone
      to appear for those co-infection patients. This article is protected by

AB  - In 2014, the worst outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) emerged in sub-Saharan
      Africa (SSA) causing fear and panic. The outbreak which started in Guinea quickly
      moved across to Sierra Leone and Liberia. With an average EVD case fatality rate 
      of around 50% (range 25-90%), there were many casualties, and the number of

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused
      by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has
      recently spread worldwide and been declared a pandemic. We aim to describe here
      the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases.
      METHODS: Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected
      and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and 
      radiological images are discussed. RESULTS: The clinical course of the eleven
      cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical
      presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients 
      with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of
      the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing 
      of virus specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for
      diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct
      symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia
      were more severe. CONCLUSION: All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 
      should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict
      quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide clinical management guidelines for novel coronavirus
      (COVID-19) in pregnancy. METHODS: On February 5, 2020, a multidisciplinary
      teleconference comprising Chinese physicians and researchers was held and medical
      management strategies of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy were discussed. RESULTS:
      Ten key recommendations were provided for the management of COVID-19 infections
      in pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is no clear evidence regarding optimal
      delivery timing, the safety of vaginal delivery, or whether cesarean delivery
      prevents vertical transmission at the time of delivery; therefore, route of
      delivery and delivery timing should be individualized based on obstetrical
      indications and maternal-fetal status.

AB  - An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease-19 (nCoV-19) infection began in
      December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and now involved the whole word. Several health
      workers have been infected in different countries. We report the case of a young 
      man with documented nCoV-19 infection evaluated with lung ultrasound and discuss 
      potential applications of lung ultrasound in this setting. Lung ultrasound
      allowed the identification of nCoV-19 infection at bed-side. Moreover, lung
      ultrasound can have several other advantages, such as reduced health worker
      exposition to infected patients, repeatability during follow-up, low-costs and
      easier application in low-resource settings.

AB  - The three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus (HCoV) infections
      at the beginning of 21st century have highlighted the necessity for readily
      available, accurate and fast diagnostic testing methods. The laboratory
      diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially,
      with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests
      for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and
      specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This
      presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing
      coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak
      going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of 
      purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method
      used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some
      infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy.
      Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of 
      the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasal-pharynx increases. Several integrated, 
      random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development
      for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These assays are
      simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing 
      the burden of identifying and treating patients.

TI  - Seasonality of Respiratory Viral Infections.
LID - 10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445 [doi]
AB  - The seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases has been widely recognized for
      thousands of years, as annual epidemics of the common cold and influenza disease 
      hit the human population like clockwork in the winter season in temperate
      regions. Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during
      the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory
      viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major
      contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human
      behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on
      respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research
      highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature
      and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses
      to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how
      outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory
      infections. We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality
      of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field. Expected
      final online publication date for the Annual Review of Virology, Volume 7 is
      September 29, 2020. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with droplets and contact
      as the main means of transmission. Since the first case appeared in Wuhan, China,
      in December 2019, the outbreak has gradually spread nationwide. Up to now,
      according to official data released by the Chinese health commission, the number 
      of newly diagnosed patients has been declining, and the epidemic is gradually
      being controlled. Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis
      after infection, some patients developed severe and die from multiple organ
      complications. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans remains
      unclear. Immune function is a strong defense against invasive pathogens and there
      is currently no specific antiviral drug against the virus. This article reviews
      the immunological changes of coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and other viral
      pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV-2. Combined with the published literature, the
      potential pathogenesis of COVID-19 is inferred, and the treatment recommendations
      for giving high-doses intravenous immunoglobulin and low-molecular-weight heparin
      anticoagulant therapy to severe type patients are proposed.

TI  - Recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment of the emerging
      SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in haemodialysis centres.
LID - gfaa069 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfaa069 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, is a major global human threat
      that has turned into a pandemic. This novel coronavirus has specifically high
      morbidity in the elderly and in comorbid populations. Uraemic patients on
      dialysis combine an intrinsic fragility and a very frequent burden of
      comorbidities with a specific setting in which many patients are repeatedly
      treated in the same area (haemodialysis centres). Moreover, if infected, the
      intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further
      complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting
      healthcare systems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures
      to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high
      incidence rates must be taken very seriously. The aim of the present review of
      the European Dialysis (EUDIAL) Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide
      recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis
      centres of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The management of patients on dialysis
      affected by COVID-19 must be carried out according to strict protocols to
      minimize the risk for other patients and personnel taking care of these patients.
      Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation and distribution have
      been shown to be efficient in similar settings. They are essential in the
      management of the pandemic and should be taken in the early stages of the
      disease.

TI  - COVID-19: a recommendation to examine the effect of hydroxychloroquine in
      preventing infection and progression.
LID - dkaa114 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkaa114 [doi]
AB  - A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has 
      swept across 31 provinces in China and over 40 countries worldwide. The
      transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is
      highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release. There is an urgent need
      to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a
      promising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe
      side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an
      antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better
      therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of
      COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has 
      a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is
      cheaper and more readily available in China. We herein strongly urge that
      clinical trials are performed to assess the preventive effects of HCQ in both
      disease infection and progression.

AB  - Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) findings of 5 cases of the
      novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from patients outside of
      Wuhan were reviewed. The human-to-human transmission of the virus may explain the
      infection of the disease outside of Wuhan. CT examination is important in the
      early detection and follow-up of the disease. With a history of exposure or
      travelling, symptoms of fever and cough, and the typical CT manifestation such as
      ground-glass opacity with a peripheral distribution, we should also think of the 
      possibility of the COVID-19 pneumonia in patients outside of Wuhan.

TI  - Response of Chinese Anesthesiologists to the COVID-19 Outbreak.
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000003300 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019, named COVID-19 officially by the World Health
      Organization (Geneva, Switzerland) on February 12, 2020, has spread at
      unprecedented speed. After the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, Chinese
      anesthesiologists encountered increasing numbers of infected patients since
      December 2019. Because the main route of transmission is via respiratory droplets
      and close contact, anesthesia providers are at a high risk when responding to the
      devastating mass emergency. So far, actions have been taken including but not
      limited to nationwide actions and online education regarding special procedures
      of airway management, oxygen therapy, ventilation support, hemodynamic
      management, sedation, and analgesia. As the epidemic situation has lasted for
      months (thus far), special platforms have also been set up to provide free mental
      health care to all anesthesia providers participating in acute and critical
      caring for COVID-19 patients. The current article documents the actions taken,
      lesson learned, and future work needed.

TI  - Perioperative Management of Patients Infected with the Novel Coronavirus:
      Recommendation from the Joint Task Force of the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology
      and the Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists.
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000003301 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of the new Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has been involved in
      77,262 cases in China as well as in 27 other countries as of February 24, 2020.
      Because the virus is novel to human beings, and there is no vaccine yet
      available, every individual is susceptible and can become infected. Healthcare
      workers are at high risk, and unfortunately, more than 3,000 healthcare workers
      in China have been infected. Anesthesiologists are among healthcare workers who
      are at an even higher risk of becoming infected because of their close contact
      with infected patients and high potential of exposure to respiratory droplets or 
      aerosol from their patients' airways. In order to provide healthcare workers with
      updated recommendations on the management of patients in the perioperative
      setting as well as for emergency airway management outside of the operating room,
      the two largest anesthesia societies, the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology (CSA)
      and the Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists (CAA) have formed a task force
      to produce the recommendations. The task force hopes to help healthcare workers, 
      particularly anesthesiologists, optimize the care of their patients and protect
      patients, healthcare workers, and the public from becoming infected. The
      recommendations were created mainly based on the practice and experience of
      anesthesiologists who provide care to patients in China. Therefore, adoption of
      these recommendations outside of China must be done with caution, and the local
      environment, culture, uniqueness of the healthcare system, and patients' needs
      should be considered. The task force will continuously update the recommendations
      and incorporate new information in future versions.

AB  - Healthcare systems worldwide are responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019
      (COVID-19), an emerging infectious syndrome caused by the Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Patients with COVID-19 can
      progress from asymptomatic or mild illness to hypoxemic respiratory failure or
      multisystem organ failure, necessitating intubation and intensive care
      management. Healthcare providers, and particularly anesthesiologists, are at the 
      frontline of this epidemic, and they need to be aware of the best available
      evidence to guide therapeutic management of patients with COVID-19 and to keep
      themselves safe while doing so. Here, the authors review COVID-19 pathogenesis,
      presentation, diagnosis, and potential therapeutics, with a focus on management
      of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. The authors draw on literature from
      other viral epidemics, treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and
      recent publications on COVID-19, as well as guidelines from major health
      organizations. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the evidence
      currently available to guide management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Human coronaviruses continue to pose a threat to human health. The emergence of
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019
      which causes coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory disease
      marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human
      population in the twenty-first century. This recent emergence of a previously
      unknown coronavirus in China leads to huge impacts on humans globally. Covid-19
      is a challenge to global public health. Here, we discuss the COVID-19 outbreak in
      a one health context, highlighting the need for the implementation of one health 
      measures and practices to improve human health and reduce the emergence of
      pandemic viruses.

AB  - Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as
      SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However,
      there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug
      repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing
      drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug
      discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing
      methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, 
      quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in
      the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV
      whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide
      sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and
      nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved
      regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared 
      to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host
      interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV
      repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are
      further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced
      transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential
      drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus
      melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the "Complementary Exposure"
      pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target
      separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study
      offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate
      repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting
      2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - We prepared the three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 (aka 2019-nCoV) 3C-like
      protease (3CL (pro)) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96%
      identity) ortholog from the SARS-CoV. All residues involved in the catalysis,
      substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the
      polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C-like cleavage sites on
      the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical
      substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that 
      some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV
      enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. With the 3CL (pro)
      molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and
      proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir 
      or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new
      coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache. The drugs
      Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be
      very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes.

TI  - Social Capital and Sleep Quality in Individuals Who Self-Isolated for 14 Days
      During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in January 2020 in China.
PG  - e923921

AB  - BACKGROUND From the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      began to spread in central China. Social capital is a measure of social trust,
      belonging, and participation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of
      social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who
      self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in
      central China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home
      for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third
      day of isolation. Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal
      Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the
      Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the
      Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was
      performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social
      capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson's correlation
      analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS Low levels of social
      capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but
      increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased
      quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality,
      and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social 
      capital on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS During a period of individual
      self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased
      social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress.

AB  - Outside the Hubei province, China, the mild form of infection and the progressive
      recover of the COVID-19 patients suggest the intervention of "unconventional"
      biological mechanisms worthy of attention. Based on the high-homology between the
      Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we hypothesized
      that past contact with infected dogs shield humans against the circulating
      SARS-CoV-2. Elseways, the recurrent virus exposure over a short time-lapse might 
      result in the Antibody Dependent Enhancement, triggering the violent immune
      reaction responsible for the severe clinical outcomes observed in the Hubei
      province. Nevertheless, further experimental studies are desired for a
      confidential evaluation of the postulated hypotheses.

AB  - The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, 
      China has now spread to many countries worldwide. Current epidemiologic knowledge
      suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits
      opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the
      children's contribution to viral spread in the community. Here, we report the
      first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. The 10-year-old girl was a close
      contact of her uncle and her mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19. In this 
      report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require
      antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens.
      Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal strategy of self-quarantine and patient 
      care in a negative isolation room for children.

AB  - As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is ongoing, the number of
      individuals to be tested for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing. For safe and
      efficient screening for COVID-19, drive-through (DT) screening centers have been 
      designed and implemented in Korea. Herein, we present the overall concept,
      advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 DT screening centers. The steps of
      the DT centers include registration, examination, specimen collection, and
      instructions. The entire service takes about 10 minutes for one testee without
      leaving his or her cars. Increased testing capacity over 100 tests per day and
      prevention of cross-infection between testees in the waiting space are the major 
      advantages, while protection of staff from the outdoor atmosphere is challenging.
      It could be implemented in other countries to cope with the global COVID-19
      outbreak and transformed according to their own situations.

      Wuhan: a single center's observational study.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-020-00354-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by
      SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China. People of all ages are
      susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients 
      with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of
      severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included eight severe or
      critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit
      (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected
      information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory
      findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. 
      RESULTS: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years;
      six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever
      (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven 
      patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or 
      increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin
      and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other
      findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3
      (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-gamma (2/8).
      Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two
      critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February
      24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five
      recovered and were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of severe
      pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by
      fever and cough. Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and 
      ground-glass opacity; and a cytokine storm was found in these patients, which
      appeared more serious in critically ill patients.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, first reported in Wuhan, China, has
      rapidly swept around the world just within a month, causing global public health 
      emergency. In diagnosis, chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations can
      supplement parts of limitations of real-time reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Based on a comprehensive literature review and the
      experience in the frontline, we aim to review the typical and relatively atypical
      CT manifestations with representative COVID-19 cases at our hospital, and hope to
      strengthen the recognition of these features with radiologists and help them make
      a quick and accurate diagnosis.Key Points * Ground glass opacities,
      consolidation, reticular pattern, and crazy paving pattern are typical CT
      manifestations of COVID-19. * Emerging atypical CT manifestations, including
      airway changes, pleural changes, fibrosis, nodules, etc., were demonstrated in
      COVID-19 patients. * CT manifestations may associate with the progression and
      prognosis of COVID-19.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report CT features of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in patients
      with various disease severity. METHODS: The CT manifestations and clinical data
      of 73 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected in 6 hospitals from
      Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020. We analyzed the initial and follow-up CT features of
      patients with disease severity, according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and
      Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia. RESULTS: Six patients (8%) were diagnosed
      as mild type pneumonia; these patients had no obvious abnormal CT findings or
      manifested mild changes of lung infection. All 43 patients (59 %) with common
      type presented unique or multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the periphery
      of the lungs, with or without interlobular septal thickening. In the 21 patients 
      (29 %) with severe type, extensive GGO and pulmonary consolidation were found in 
      16 cases (16/21, 76 %) and 5 cases (24 %), respectively. An extensive "white
      lung", with atelectasis and pleural effusion were found in critical type patients
      (3, 4%). On the resolutive phase of the disease, CT abnormalities showed complete
      resolution, or demonstrated residual linear opacities. CONCLUSIONS: Different CT 
      features are seen according to disease severity, which can help COVID-19
      stratification.

TI  - Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for
      surveillance and response measures.
LID - S0140-6736(20)30528-6 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a
      tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in
      Singapore in February, 2020. METHODS: We gathered epidemiological and clinical
      data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient
      medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and
      possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported
      the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: As of Feb 15, 2020,
      36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of
      circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were
      quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected
      individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food)
      could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR
      3-6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 
      days. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and
      local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from
      China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions.
      Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of
      widespread transmission in the community. FUNDING: None.

AB  - The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) makes the medical treatment 
      of colorectal cancers difficult. Cancer patients are more susceptible to
      infection and tumor history is defined as an important factor of poor prognosis, 
      which challenges both doctors and patients. For metastatic colorectal cancer
      (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice. The patients with
      tumor progression or poor biological behavior should receive or continue
      combination chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of
      treatment and shorten the therapy time. Fever patients during chemotherapy need
      to receive differential diagnosis and screening according to national standards. 
      Patients with stable diseases and good general conditions may delay imaging
      examination. Clinicians should make individual clinical decisions based on the
      specifics of each patient during epidemic situation.

AB  - Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently raging in China. It has been
      proven that COVID-19 can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital
      infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients. Although
      colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic,
      but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest
      quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of 
      maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical
      staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the
      clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and
      control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and
      treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences
      of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal 
      cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the
      perioperative management. More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative 
      management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected 
      or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control
      measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main
      points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the
      diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only
      routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department.
      (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of COVID-19 to patients and
      doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and
      life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign
      bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected
      or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and
      intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The
      colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed 
      in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with
      negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, 
      body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified
      disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical
      workers who process colorectal cancer patients with COVID-19 must be protected by
      three-level. After operation, the medical workers must receive medical
      observation and be isolated for 14 days. We hope our "Renji experience" will be
      beneficial to colleagues.

AB  - Pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV infection has been reported in Wuhan since December
      2019, and spread rapidly across the country. The radical operation of colorectal 
      cancer is semi-elective operation. Patients with colorectal cancer should receive
      operation as soon as possible after elective operation is resumed in each
      hospital. 2019-nCoV virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic infectors, and it
      has been confirmed to be transmitted by droplets and contact. However, fecal-oral
      transmission and aerosol transmission have not been excluded. Based on our
      experience with laparoscopic colorectal operation, we propose some surgery
      strategies for colorectal cancer patients under the corona virus disease
      2019(COVID-19) situation: the screening process should be strictly carried out
      before surgery to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection in the later stage;
      laparoscopic-assisted surgery is recommended for radical surgery for patients
      with colorectal cancer; strict aerosol management must be made during the
      operation; natural orifice specimen extraction surgery and transanal total
      mesorectal excision are should be performed prudently; scientific and reasonable 
      prophylactic stoma should be done; personnel protection in surgical ward and
      operation room must be strengthened.

AB  - In December 2019, a new outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 began to occur. Its
      pathogen is 2019-nCoV, which has the characteristics of strong infectivity and
      general susceptibility. The current situation of prevention and control of new
      coronavirus pneumonia is severe. In this context, as front-line medical workers
      bearing important responsibilities and pressure, while through strict management 
      strategy, we can minimize the risk of infection exposure. By summarizing the
      research progress and guidelines in recent years in the fields of colorectal
      cancer disease screening, treatment strategies (including early colorectal

AB  - The novel coronavirus (now called SARS-CoV-2) initially discovered in Wuhan,
      China, has now become a global pandemic. We describe a patient presenting to an
      Emergency Department in Rhode Island on March 12, 2020 with cough and shortness
      of breath after a trip to Jamaica. The patient underwent nasopharyngeal swab for 
      a respiratory pathogen panel as well as SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. When the respiratory
      pathogen panel was positive for human metapneumovirus, the patient was treated
      and discharged. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR came back positive 24 hours later. Although
      respiratory viral co-infection is thought to be relatively uncommon in adults,
      this case reflects that SARS-CoV-2 testing algorithms that exclude patients who
      test positive for routine viral pathogens may miss SARS-CoV-2 co-infected
      patients.

AB  - Over the past three months, the world has faced an unprecedented health hazard.
      The World Health Organization has announced a pandemic infection with an unknown 
      species of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Spreading mainly through the droplet
      route, the virus causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases, the most common
      being: fever (80%), dry cough (56%), fatigue (22%) and muscle pain (7%); less
      common symptoms include a sore throat, a runny nose, diarrhea, hemoptysis and
      chills. A life-threatening complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs more often in older adults,
      those with immune disorders and co-morbidities. Severe forms of the infection,
      being an indication for treatment in the intensive care unit, comprise acute lung
      inflammation, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. The article presents basic
      information about etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics (with particular
      emphasis on the importance of tomocomputer imaging), clinical picture, treatment 
      and prevention of the infection. It goes on to emphasize the specific risks of
      providing anesthesiology and intensive care services. Due to the fact that
      effective causal treatment is not yet available and the number of infections and 
      deaths increases day by day, infection prevention and strict adherence to
      recommendations of infection control organizations remain the basis for fighting 
      the virus.

AB  - Switzerland is among the countries with the highest number of coronavirus
      disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases per capita in the world. There are likely many
      people with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection because testing efforts are currently
      not detecting all infected people, including some with clinical disease
      compatible with COVID-19. Testing on its own will not stop the spread of
      SARS-CoV-2. Testing is part of a strategy. The World Health Organization
      recommends a combination of measures: rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of 
      cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts. In
      this article, we explain why the testing strategy in Switzerland should be
      strengthened urgently, as a core component of a combination approach to control
      COVID-19.

AB  - Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected
      pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for
      diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive
      patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image
      findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with
      mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women,
      with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered
      condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was
      higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). 
      The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival
      group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of
      ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and
      central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score
      of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12
      (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P =
      0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a 
      CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the
      prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with 
      chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground
      glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined
      peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly
      involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.

PG  - 307-311
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm6911e1 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in
      December 2019, and has since spread globally, resulting in >95,000 confirmed
      COVID-19 cases worldwide by March 5, 2020 (1). Singapore adopted a multipronged
      surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical
      consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19,
      enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with
      pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible
      infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and
      deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion
      (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case
      definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients. Containment measures,
      including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border
      controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize
      disease spread. As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been
      identified in Singapore. This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in 
      Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment
      measures. COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they
      were detected. Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 
      73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by
      laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion. Effectiveness of
      these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the
      interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which
      indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19
      cases. Rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts,
      and active monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing
      expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing 
      outbreaks.

AB  - An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among passengers and crew on a
      cruise ship led to quarantine of approximately 3,700 passengers and crew that
      began on February 3, 2020, and lasted for nearly 4 weeks at the Port of Yokohama,
      Japan (1). By February 9, 20 cases had occurred among the ship's crew members. By
      the end of quarantine, approximately 700 cases of COVID-19 had been
      laboratory-confirmed among passengers and crew. This report describes findings
      from the initial phase of the cruise ship investigation into COVID-19 cases among
      crew members during February 4-12, 2020.

TI  - Natural small molecules as inhibitors of coronavirus lipid-dependent attachment
      to host cells: a possible strategy for reducing SARS-COV-2 infectivity?
PG  - 161-164
LID - 10.23750/abm.v91i1.9402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral infectivity depends on interactions between components of the
      host cell plasma membrane and the virus envelope. Here we review strategies that 
      could help stem the advance of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
      focus on the role of lipid structures, such as lipid rafts and cholesterol,
      involved in the process, mediated by endocytosis, by which viruses attach to and 
      infect cells. Previous studies have shown that many naturally derived substances,
      such as cyclodextrin and sterols, could reduce the infectivity of many types of
      viruses, including the coronavirus family, through interference with
      lipid-dependent attachment to human host cells. CONCLUSIONS: Certain molecules
      prove able to reduce the infectivity of some coronaviruses, possibly by
      inhibiting viral lipid-dependent attachment to host cells. More research into
      these molecules and methods would be worthwhile as it could provide insights the 
      mechanism of transmission of SARS-COV-2 and, into how they could become a basis
      for new antiviral strategies.

      coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic (1). At a news briefing , WHO
      Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted that over the past 2
      weeks, the number of cases outside China increased 13-fold and the number of
      countries with cases increased threefold. Further increases are expected. He said
      that the WHO is "deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and
      severity and by the alarming levels of inaction," and he called on countries to
      take action now to contain the virus. "We should double down," he said. "We
      should be more aggressive." [...].

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated to COVID-19 and sustained by the severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the latest biological
      hazard to assume the relevance of insidious worldwide threat. One obvious
      question that is now engaging the minds of many scientists and healthcare
      professionals is whether and eventually how laboratory medicine could efficiently
      contribute to counteract this and other (future) viral outbreaks. Despite there
      being evidence that laboratory tests are vital throughout many clinical pathways,
      there are at least three major areas where in vitro diagnostics can also provide 
      essential contributions to diagnostic reasoning and managed care of patients with
      suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include etiological diagnosis,
      patient monitoring, as well as epidemiologic surveillance. Nonetheless, some
      structural and practical aspects may generate substantial hurdles in providing
      timely and efficient response to this infectious emergency, which basically
      include inadequate (insufficient) environment and shortage of technical and human
      resources for facing enhanced volume of tests on many infected patients, some of 
      whom are with severe disease. Some proactive and reactive strategies may hence be
      identified to confront this serious healthcare challenge, which entail major
      investments on conventional laboratory resources, reinforcement of regional
      networks of clinical laboratories, installation of mobile laboratories, as well
      as being proactive in establishing laboratory emergency plans.

LID - 10.1148/radiol.2020200905 [doi]
AB  - Background Coronavirus disease has widely spread all over the world since the
      beginning of 2020. It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of
      COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect
      COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performances. Materials and Methods In
      this retrospective and multi-center study, a deep learning model, COVID-19
      detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from 
      volumetric chest CT exams for the detection of COVID-19. Community acquired
      pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia CT exams were included to test the
      robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from 6 hospitals between
      August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and
      specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4356 chest CT exams from 
      3,322 patients. The average age is 49+/-15 years and there were slightly more
      male patients than female (1838 vs 1484; p-value=0.29). The per-exam sensitivity 
      and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 114 of 127
      (90% [95% CI: 83%, 94%]) and 294 of 307 (96% [95% CI: 93%, 98%]), respectively,
      with an AUC of 0.96 (p-value<0.001). The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for
      detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175) and 92% (239 of
      259), respectively, with an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusions A deep 
      learning model can accurately detect COVID-19 and differentiate it from community
      acquired pneumonia and other lung diseases.

AB  - The evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic(1) is certainly cause
      for concern. Proper communication and optimal decision-making is an ongoing
      challenge, as data evolve. The challenge is compounded, however, by exaggerated
      information. This can lead to inappropriate actions. It is important to
      differentiate promptly the true epidemic from an epidemic of false claims and
      potentially harmful actions.

TI  - 2019-nCoV: The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging
      Coronavirus.
PG  - 184-190
LID - 10.5811/westjem.2020.1.46760 [doi]
AB  - 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely
      related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei
      Province, China in December 2019. As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are
      continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the
      United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high
      volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the
      2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of
      infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, 
      all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it
      is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be
      able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated.
      The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial
      detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious
      agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a 
      modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of
      patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms
      and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure
      to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a
      risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected
      persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the
      appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 3I Tool will assist
      emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in
      effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.25773 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of the novel beta Coronavirus, recently renamed as severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, has raised serious concerns due
      to the virus rapid dissemination worldwide. Nevertheless, there is limited
      information about the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Italy
      from surveillance studies. The shortage of complete genomic sequences available
      impairs our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 introduction and establishment in the
      country. To better understand its dynamics in Italy, we analysed complete genomes
      of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, obtained directly from clinical samples. Our phylogenetic
      reconstructions suggest possible multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2. Continued
      genomic surveillance strategies are needed to improve monitoring and
      understanding of the currently SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, which might help to
      attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases. This article is protected

      patients in epidemic period: A case report of familial cluster with three
      asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25776 [doi]
AB  - At present, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rampaging around the world.
      However, asymptomatic carriers intensified the difficulty of prevention and
      management. Here we reported the screening, clinical feathers, and treatment
      process of a family cluster involving three COVID-19 patients. The discovery of
      the first asymptomatic carrier in this family cluster depends on the repeated and
      comprehensive epidemiological investigation by disease control experts. In
      addition, the combination of multiple detection methods can help clinicians find 
      asymptomatic carriers as early as possible. In conclusion, the prevention and
      control experience of this family cluster showed that comprehensive rigorous
      epidemiological investigation and combination of multiple detection methods were 
      of great value for the detection of hidden asymptomatic carriers. This article is

AB  - An outbreak of COVID-19 developed aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during
      January-February 2020. Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data
      describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we
      characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the
      outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting
      reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from 
      community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 
      1.1-7). Our findings suggest that R t decreased substantially compared to values 
      during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced
      quarantine control. Most recent estimates of R t reached values largely below the
      epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus
      was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.

LID - 10.1007/s11604-020-00945-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of CT characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia might be helpful
      to the early diagnosis and treatment of patients, and to control the spread of
      infection. METHODS: The chest CT images of the patient were collected to describe
      the CT manifestations and characteristics, and they were compared with the
      previous studies. RESULTS: Multiple patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were
      seen in bilateral lung, mostly in subpleural areas. They progressed within 3
      days, and nodular GGOs were also seen together with subpleural patchy GGOs.
      CONCLUSION: Our case of COVID-19 pneumonia showed multiple subpleural GGOs in
      bilateral lung, rapid progression, and it also accompanied nodular GGOs on chest 
      CT. These findings were consistent with the previous reports, and they might be
      useful for early detection and evaluation of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019,
      requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global
      threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are 
      built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and
      decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19
      outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However,
      unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools
      are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models
      that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of
      the paper.

AB  - The current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reached Germany. The
      majority of people infected present with mild disease, but there are severe cases
      that need intensive care. Unlike other acute infectious diseases progressing to
      sepsis, the severe courses of COVID19 seemingly show prolonged progression from
      onset of first symptoms to life-threatening deterioration of (primarily) lung
      function. Diagnosis relies on PCR using specimens from the respiratory tract.
      Severe ARDS reflects the hallmark of a critical course of the disease. Preventing
      nosocomial infections (primarily by correct use of personal protective equipment)
      and maintenance of hospitals' operational capability are of utmost importance.
      Departments of Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and emergency medicine will envisage
      major challenges.

TI  - Analysis of COVID-19 infection spread in Japan based on stochastic transition
      model.
LID - 10.5582/bst.2020.01482 [doi]
AB  - To assess the effectiveness of response strategies of avoiding large gatherings
      or crowded areas and to predict the spread of COVID-19 infections in Japan, we
      developed a stochastic transmission model by extending the
      Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model with an additional
      modeling of the individual action on whether to stay away from the crowded areas.
      The population were divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected,
      Removed. Susceptible transitions to Infected every hour with a probability
      determined by the ratio of Infected and the congestion of area. The total area
      consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different
      infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. The
      time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 
      and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly. This
      simulation showed that the number of Infected and Removed will increase rapidly
      if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone. On the other hand,
      the stagnant growth of Infected can be observed when the time spent in the
      crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of Infected will
      decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent
      in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours. In conclusions The infection
      spread in Japan will be gradually contained by reducing the time spent in the
      crowded zone to less than 4 hours.

AB  - The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) from the Hubei province in China in late 2019 demonstrates the
      epidemic potential of coronaviruses. The rapid spread of this virus across the
      world in only 2 months highlights the transmissibility of this family of viruses 
      and the significant morbidity and mortality that they can cause. We highlight the
      current state of knowledge of coronavirus biology while answering questions
      concerning the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan,
      Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to
      China's public health and clinical treatment. The virus belongs to the beta genus
      Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and 
      MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through 
      droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period
      could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current
      observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger
      transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related 
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor 
      SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot
      of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents,
      identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may
      inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of
      2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic
      coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and 
      control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.

AB  - The 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19) has cost a great loss to the health and
      economic property of Chines people. Under such a special circumstance, how to
      deal with such patients with acute aortic syndrome has become a serious
      challenge. Rapid diagnosis of concomitant COVID-19, safe and effective
      transportation, implementation of the interventional procedure, protection of
      vascular surgical team and postoperative management and follow-up of such
      patients have become urgent problems for us. Combined with the latest novel
      government documents, the literature and the experiences from Wuhan, we answered 
      the above questions briefly and plainly. We also hope to inspire the national
      vascular surgeons to manage critical emergencies in vascular surgery and even
      routine vascular diseases with COVID-19, as a final point to limit the severe
      epidemic situation, and minimize the damage of COVID-19.

AB  - The 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease, has a long
      incubation period and a variety of clinical manifestations, which has a
      significant impact on public health and life. Afterwards, scientific and
      standardized work processing during the epidemic is of great significance for
      prevention and control. In order to implement the central government's
      decision-making deployment and defeat the COVID-19 as soon as possible, we had
      focused on the key points in the clinical work of general surgery according to
      latest relevant guidelines, literature and experience in epidemic prevention.
      Finally, we drafted the prevention and control strategies and recommendations to 
      make a reference for medical staff of general surgery to fight against COVID-19.

      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.
LID - 10.3201/eid2606.200495 [doi]
AB  - It appears inevitable that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will
      continue to spread. Although we still have limited information on the
      epidemiology of this virus, there have been multiple reports of superspreading
      events (SSEs), which are associated with both explosive growth early in an
      outbreak and sustained transmission in later stages. Although SSEs appear to be
      difficult to predict and therefore difficult to prevent, core public health
      actions can prevent and reduce the number and impact of SSEs. To prevent and
      control of SSEs, speed is essential. Prevention and mitigation of SSEs depends,
      first and foremost, on quickly recognizing and understanding these events,
      particularly within healthcare settings. Better understanding transmission
      dynamics associated with SSEs, identifying and mitigating high-risk settings,
      strict adherence to healthcare infection prevention and control measures, and
      timely implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions can help prevent and
      control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, as well as future
      infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that
      emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries
      worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus
      (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no 
      licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the
      efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S 
      protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates 
      have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized
      animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection.
      This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics
      to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made 
      with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt
      this emerging virus infection.

      Pneumonia: A Preliminary Analysis.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.23072 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations 
      and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women 
      and to provide some initial evidence that can be used for guiding treatment of
      pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the
      clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 
      pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020. A
      semiquantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate pulmonary involvement and
      the time course of changes on chest CT. Symptoms and laboratory results were
      analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were
      tracked. RESULTS. Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries
      and one vaginal delivery) during the study period, and four patients were still
      pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the
      end of the study period. No cases of neonatal asphyxia, neonatal death,
      stillbirth, or abortion were reported. The most common early finding on chest CT 
      was ground-glass opacity (GGO). With disease progression, crazy paving pattern
      and consolidations were seen on CT. The abnormalities showed absorptive changes
      at the end of the study period for all patients. The most common onset symptoms
      of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were fever (13/15 patients) and cough
      (9/15 patients). The most common abnormal laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia 
      (12/15 patients). CT images obtained before and after delivery showed no signs of
      pneumonia aggravation after delivery. The four patients who were still pregnant
      at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had
      achieved good recovery. CONCLUSION. Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate
      the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia. All the cases of
      COVID-19 pneumonia in the pregnant women in our study were the mild type. All the
      women in this study-some of whom did not receive antiviral drugs-achieved good
      recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - Information on severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (transmissibility,
      disease seriousness, impact) is crucial for preparation of healthcare sectors. We
      present a simple approach to assess disease seriousness, creating a reference
      cohort of pneumonia patients from sentinel hospitals. First comparisons exposed a
      higher rate of COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation. There were more case
      fatalities among COVID-19 patients without comorbidities than in the reference
      cohort. Hospitals should prepare for high utilisation of ventilation and
      intensive care resources.

AB  - Severe and critical coronavirus pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19) often occurs in elder
      patients with multiple comorbidities, and severe hypoxemia events are an
      important factor in the deterioration of some cases. The critical type of
      COVID-19 could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ
      dysfunction, which are the most important causes of death. Early start with
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) against the possible physiological abnormalities
      could be helpful to improve prognosis. Close monitoring of oxygenation, reducing 
      patients' oxygen consumption, active psychological intervention, and rapidly
      dealing with severe hypoxemia events are the key factors for the successful
      treatment of NIV. In addition, active adjuvant therapy is also important, such as
      correcting coagulation dysfunction, providing proper nutritional support,
      accurate volume control, and safe individualized blood glucose monitoring and
      control.

AB  - Objective: Analyzing the symptom characteristics of Coronavirus Disease
      2019(COVID-19) to improve its prevention. Methods: Using Baidu Index Platform
      (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control
      and Prevention as data resources to obtain the search volume (SV) of keywords for
      symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from
      2017 to 2020, in Hubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in China and 
      the epidemic data. Data of 2020 were compared with the previous three years. Data
      of Hubei province were compared with confirmed cases. The differences and
      characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation
      between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and
      the hysteresis effects were discussed. Results: Compared the data from January 1 
      to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years,
      Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other
      symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms
      was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001). The
      SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with new confirmed 
      or suspected cases (R(confirmed) = 0.723, R(suspected) = 0.863, all P < 0.001).
      The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who
      retrieved relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days
      later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. Conclusions: The total SV of lower
      respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the
      SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. It warns us to pay attention to not 
      only the symptoms of lower respiratory tract, but also the gastrointestinal
      symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19. There is a relationship 
      between Internet retrieval behavior and the number of new confirmed or suspected 
      cases. Big data has a certain role in the early warning of infectious diseases.

AB  - Since the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been
      extensively epidemic in China, which not only seriously threatens the safety and 
      health of Chinese people, but also challenges the management of other infectious 
      diseases. Currently, there are still approximately three thousand malaria cases
      imported into China every year. If the diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases
      as well as the investigation and response of the epidemic foci are not carried
      out timely, it may endanger patients'lives and cause the possible of secondary
      transmission, which threatens the achievements of malaria elimination in China.
      Due to the extensive spread and high transmission ability of the COVID-19, there 
      is a possibility of virus infections among malaria cases during the medical
      care-seeking behaviors and among healthcare professionals during clinical
      diagnosis and treatment, sample collection and testing and epidemiological
      surveys. This paper analyzes the challenges of the COVID-19 for Chinese malaria
      elimination programme, and proposes the countermeasures in response to the
      COVID-19 outbreak, so as to provide the reference for healthcare professionals.

AB  - Crises often drive innovation. The COVID 19 pandemic has led to the necessary
      postponement of much planned surgical activity with the cancellation of
      outpatient, diagnostic and operative work. These measures have been designed to
      'flatten the curve' and delay the spread of coronavirus whilst also freeing up
      capacity within hospitals for patients affected with the virus. This inevitable
      postponement of routine activity will create challenges to health care systems
      when normal business resumes and in many healthcare settings, which are often
      already resource constrained. This will impose an additional burden on patients
      whose diagnoses and treatment will be delayed.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) causes a
      cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. It spread rapidly and globally. CT
      imaging is helpful for the evaluation of the novel coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) pneumonia. Infection control inside the CT suites is also important to
      prevent hospital-related transmission of COVID-19. We present our experience with
      infection control protocol for COVID-19 inside the CT suites.

AB  - Effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the
      2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) require the development of data and tools to 
      understand and monitor its spread and immune responses to it. However, little
      information is available about the targets of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. We 
      used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) to catalog
      available data related to other coronaviruses. This includes SARS-CoV, which has 
      high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and is the best-characterized coronavirus 
      in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in
      SARS-CoV-2 that have high homology to the SARS-CoV virus. Parallel bioinformatic 
      predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2.
      The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects 
      the high probability that these regions are promising targets for immune
      recognition of SARS-CoV-2. These predictions can facilitate effective vaccine
      design against this virus of high priority.

      correlations also showed a maximum correlation at 8-12 days for
      laboratory-confirmed cases and 6-8 days for suspected cases.

AB  - Since December 2019, 62 medical staff of Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China have
      been hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019. During the post-discharge
      surveillance after clinical recovery, swabs were positive in two asymptomatic
      cases (3.23%). Case 1 had presented typical clinical and radiological
      manifestations on admission, while manifestation in Case 2 was very mild. In
      conclusion, a small proportion of recovered patients may test positive after
      discharge, and post-discharge surveillance and isolation need to be strengthened.

AB  - On 5 February 2020, in Yokohama, Japan, a cruise ship hosting 3,711 people
      underwent a 2-week quarantine after a former passenger was found with COVID-19
      post-disembarking. As at 20 February, 634 persons on board tested positive for
      the causative virus. We conducted statistical modelling to derive the
      delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of infections, along with the infections' 
      timeline. The estimated asymptomatic proportion was 17.9% (95% credible interval 
      (CrI): 15.5-20.2%). Most infections occurred before the quarantine start.

TI  - Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and
      control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a
      scoping review.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s40249-020-00646-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause
      of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning
      in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries
      with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization 
      has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A
      scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by 
      Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published
      before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the
      epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus.
      The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors'
      affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis.
      All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based
      on published information as listed in the references. RESULTS: Most of the
      publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest
      proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority
      (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused
      on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to
      prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination
      is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations
      have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue,
      pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such 
      as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection,
      contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce
      transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective;
      hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive
      care. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the
      outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily
      explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well 
      as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are
      relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is
      needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health
      emergency in both the short- and long-term.

TI  - Prediction of the Epidemic Peak of Coronavirus Disease in Japan, 2020.
LID - E789 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9030789 [doi]
AB  - The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan was reported on 15
      January 2020 and the number of reported cases has increased day by day. The
      purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19
      in Japan by using the real-time data from 15 January to 29 February 2020. Taking 
      into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete identification of infective
      population, we apply the well-known SEIR compartmental model for the prediction. 
      By using a least-square-based method with Poisson noise, we estimate that the
      basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Japan is R 0 = 2 . 6 ( 95 % CI, 2 .
      4 - 2 . 8 ) and the epidemic peak could possibly reach the early-middle summer.
      In addition, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential 
      epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the 
      actual infective population; (2) the intervention has a positive effect on the
      delay of the epidemic peak; (3) intervention over a relatively long period is
      needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size.

TI  - Reverse Logistics Network Design for Effective Management of Medical Waste in
      Epidemic Outbreaks: Insights from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      Outbreak in Wuhan (China).
LID - E1770 [pii]

AB  - The outbreak of an epidemic disease may pose significant treats to human beings
      and may further lead to a global crisis. In order to control the spread of an
      epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through
      establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance.
      However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an
      epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic
      outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a
      significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper
      proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse
      logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the
      best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for
      effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very
      short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based
      on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even 
      though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the
      time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be
      obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among
      other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an
      effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during
      the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary
      incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available
      data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to
      assess the effectiveness of the current solution.

TI  - Successful recovery of COVID-19 pneumonia in a renal transplant recipient with
      long-term immunosuppression.
LID - 10.1111/ajt.15869 [doi]
AB  - The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised great
      concern worldwide, but its impact on transplant recipients is unknown. We report 
      here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported renal
      transplant recipient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. This is a 52-year-old man
      who received kidney transplantation 12 years ago. His overall clinical
      characteristics (symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT) were similar to
      those of non-transplanted COVID-19 patients. Following a treatment regimen
      consisting of reduced immunosuppressant use and low dose methylprednisolone-based
      therapy, the COVID-19 pneumonia in this long-term immunosuppressive patient was
      successfully recovered. This effectively treated case has reference value for the
      future treatment of other transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with prognosis in patients with Corona
      Virus Disease-19.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25767 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: SinceDecember 2019, novelcoronavirus infected pneumonia emerged in 
      Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. In severe novel coronavirus
      pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the
      treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR)were a concern. We sought to describe
      platelet feature of these cases. METHODS: Single-center case series of the 30
      hospitalized patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease(COVID)-19 in Huizhou
      municipal central hospitalfrom January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively
      analysed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laborotary results 
      and treatment date were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and
      non-severe patients were compared. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that: age,
      platelet peaks and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe
      patients,multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during 
      treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.The average
      hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were longer 
      than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05).The average age of patients with
      platelet peaks during treatment were older than those without platelet
      peaks(P<0.05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during
      treatment had longer average hospitalization day. And the higher PLR of patients 
      during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. CONCLUSION:
      Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19
      in Huizhou municipal central hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and 
      their dynamic changes during the treatment may have suggestion on the severity
      and prognosis of disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer
      average hospitalization day may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of
      patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator 
      in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by

TI  - A guideline for homology modeling of the proteins from newly discovered
      betacoronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25768 [doi]
AB  - During an outbreak of respiratory diseases including atypical pneumonia in Wuhan,
      a previously unknown beta-coronavirus was detected in patients. The newly
      discovered coronavirus is similar to some beta-coronaviruses found in bats, but
      different from previously known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High sequence identities
      and similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV was found. In this work, we
      searched the homologous templates of all nonstructural and structural proteins of
      2019-nCoV. Among the nonstructural proteins, the leader protein (nsp1), the
      papain-like protease (nsp3), the nsp4, the 3C-like protease (nsp5), the nsp7, the
      nsp8, the nsp9, the nsp10, the RNA-directed RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase 
      (nsp13), the guanine-N7 methyltransferase (nsp14), the uridylate-specific
      endoribonuclease (nsp15), the 2'-O-methyltransferase (nsp16), and the ORF7a
      protein could be built on the basis of homology templates. Among the structural
      proteins, the spike protein (S-protein), the envelope protein (E-protein), and
      the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) can be constructed based on the crystal
      structures of the proteins from SARS-CoV. It is known that PL-Pro, 3CL-Pro, and
      RdRp are important targets for design antiviral drugs against 2019-nCoV. And S
      protein is critical target candidate for inhibitor screening or vaccine design
      against 2019-nCoV because coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of 
      S protein to cell surface receptors. It is believed that these proteins should be
      useful for further structure-based virtual screening and related computer-aided
      drug development and vaccine design. This article is protected by copyright. All

AB  - Preparing for public health emergencies is an ongoing process and involves a
      variety of approaches and tools. Tabletop exercises are one of the tools designed
      to simulate the emergence of a public health emergency and address some or all of
      the phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and
      recovery.1 They typically are designed to include participation of stakeholders
      from diverse and complementary backgrounds, including command, operations,
      logistics, planning, and finance.2 Effective tabletop exercises provide a
      plausible scenario that require cooperation and communication from these
      functional areas. Tabletops also require forward thinking and planning in a
      variety of scenarios. When a public health emergency occurs, decision makers may 
      be overwhelmed with decisions that need their immediate attention. Tabletop
      exercises can provide a framework to help decision makers anticipate future
      challenges, which may provide the mental model encompassing knowledge and
      insights that inform both current and future decisions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT
      manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective
      study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were
      evaluated. RESULTS. One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range,
      21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever
      in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The 
      laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or
      reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level
      was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one
      lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes
      in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the
      common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had
      ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of 
      lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 
      patients [52%]). Vascular thickening (86 patients [80%]), crazy paving pattern
      (43 patients [40%]), air bronchogram sign (52 patients [48%]), and halo sign (69 
      [64%]) were also observed in this study. CONCLUSION. The early clinical and
      laboratory findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough,
      and fatigue with normal WBC count, reduced lymphocyte count, and elevated
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. The early CT findings are patchy GGO
      with or without consolidation involving multiple lobes, mainly in the peripheral 
      zone, accompanied by halo sign, vascular thickening, crazy paving pattern, or air
      bronchogram sign.

TI  - The positive impact of lockdown in Wuhan on containing the COVID-19 outbreak in
      China.
LID - taaa037 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jtm/taaa037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was
      declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World 
      Health Organization (WHO). Consequently, many countries have implemented flight
      restrictions to China. China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of
      Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province. However, whether these two enormous
      measures have led to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains 
      unclear. METHODS: We analyzed available data on the development of confirmed
      domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after lockdown measures. We 
      evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed
      COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China
      before and after lockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic
      criteria. RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time 
      from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9-2.6), to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5-4.3),
      after imposing lockdown. A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic
      and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1-26.3), respectively. Moreover, the 
      correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker
      following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, p < 0.05 vs. after lockdown: r =
      0.91, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased
      doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown
      measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have 
      a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

TI  - An Analysis of 38 Pregnant Women with COVID-19, Their Newborn Infants, and
      Maternal-Fetal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: Maternal Coronavirus Infections and
      Pregnancy Outcomes.
LID - 10.5858/arpa.2020-0901-SA [doi]
AB  - The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially
      life-threating respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly
      spread across the globe creating a massive public health problem. Previous
      epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor
      obstetrical outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal
      transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death. This communication
      reviews the effects of two previous coronavirus infections - severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory
      syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV - on pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it
      analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns
      in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including
      clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus
      from mother to fetus. This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of
      pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did
      not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS
      and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of
      SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens
      tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for
      SARS-CoV-2. At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is
      no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission
      from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Analysis of additional cases is
      necessary to determine if this remains true.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of different anesthetic regimens for parturients with
      COVID-19 undergoing Cesarean delivery: a case series of 17 patients.
LID - 10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the management and safety of epidural or general anesthesia
      for Cesarean delivery in parturients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and
      their newborns, and to evaluate the standardized procedures for protecting
      medical staff. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients
      diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
      infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed
      tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity
      were evaluated. We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical
      characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal
      complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff.
      RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult
      patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia
      performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of
      the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing
      significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general
      anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three
      of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are
      receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born
      prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All
      neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were
      infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and
      general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with
      COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia
      appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and
      effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from
      COVID-19.

      cluster cases.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-020-00356-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the
      globe. People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19. However, literature
      reports on pediatric patients are limited. METHODS: To improve the recognition of
      COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed
      pediatric cases from two family clusters. Both clinical features and laboratory
      examination results of the children and their family members were described.
      RESULTS: The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or
      gastrointestinal symptoms. Both of them had normal chest CT images. After general
      and symptomatic treatments, both children recovered quickly. Both families had
      travel histories to Hubei Province. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with COVID-19
      are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history. Infected
      children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults. We should
      attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of
      infected children.

AB  - An epidemic caused by SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection has spread unexpectedly in
      Wuhan, Hubei Province, China since December 2019. It is rarely reported about
      asymptomatic cases screened from close contacts. We study epidemiological and
      clinical outcome of 55 asymptomatic carriers who were laboratory-confirmed
      positive for the SARS-Coronavirus-2 by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal
      swab samples. The evidence showed that asymptomatic carriers occurred more often 
      in middle aged people who had close contact with infected family members. The
      majority of the cases developed to be mild and ordinary COVID-19 during hospital.

AB  - Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19) were mainly based on information from adult populations.
      Limited data are available for children with COVID-19, especially for infected
      infants. We report a 55-day-old case with COVID-19 confirmed in China and
      describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the
      patient, including the disease progression from day 7 to day 11 of illness. This 
      case highlights that children with COVID-19 can also present with multiple organ 
      damage and rapid disease changes. When managing such patients, frequent and
      careful clinical monitoring is essential.

AB  - In December 2019, a new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, has emerged from China
      causing pneumonia outbreaks first in the Wuhan region and have now spread
      worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency. Due to the lack
      of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug
      repurposing appears to be the best tool to find therapeutic solution.
      Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin or ritonavir have shown efficacy to
      inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat
      staphylococci infection, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of
      MERS-coronarivus viral cycle in human cells. This activity is conserved on the
      SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with
      this virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel
      coronavirus (COVID 2019, SARS-CoV2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, in China at the end 
      of December 2019. The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French
      nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We 
      decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the
      population and decision-makers. METHODS: We investigated the presence of
      SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within
      the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted
      from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of
      nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using
      several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. RESULTS: We tested 337
      passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By
      optimising the sampling process, sending samples sequentially and reducing the
      time-scale for biological analysis, we were able to test the samples within 5 h
      (including sampling, shipment and biological tests). CONCLUSION: Optimising our
      procedures reduces anxiety and reassures the population and decision makers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in
      December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International
      Concern (PHEIC). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially
      characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19
      have been published to date. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review
      with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging
      features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and
      also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a
      random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95%
      confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: 660 articles were retrieved for the time
      frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for
      full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative 
      analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed
      separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5-92.9%), cough (57.6%,
      95%CI 40.8-74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9-80.4%) were the most prevalent
      manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0-30.6%) required intensive
      care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
      (95%CI 13.7-51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1-9.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2-21.5%) 
      of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR).
      CONCLUSION: COVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in
      patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of
      polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a 
      CFR of >13%. As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare
      human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19.

AB  - Italy recorded its first case of confirmed acute respiratory case due to
      Coronavirus on February 18, 2020, soon after the initial reports in China. Since 
      that time, Italy and nations throughout the world have adopted very stringent and
      severe measures to protect populations from spread of infection. Despite these
      measures, the number of infected people is growing exponentially with a
      significant number of patients developing acute respiratory insufficiency.
      Endoscopy departments face significant risk for diffusion of respiratory diseases
      that can be spread via an airborne route, including aspiration of oral and fecal 
      material via endoscopes. The purpose of this article is to discuss the measures, 
      with specific focus on personal protection equipment and dressing code
      modalities, which have been implemented in our hospital to prevent further
      dissemination of COVID-19 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease
      with lack of established laboratory markers available to evaluate illness
      severity. In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could
      differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease.
      Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19.
      METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed
      to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A
      meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD)
      of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds
      ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies
      with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in
      the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was
      significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31x10(9)/L; 95%
      CI, from -35 to -29x10(9)/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival,
      found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48x10(9)/L;
      95% CI, -57 to -39x10(9)/L. In the four studies (n=1427) which reported data on
      rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold 
      enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). CONCLUSIONS: Low
      platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality 
      in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of
      worsening illness during hospitalization.

TI  - Composition of human-specific slow codons and slow di-codons in SARS-CoV and
      2019-nCoV are lower than other coronaviruses suggesting a faster protein
      synthesis rate of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV.

AB  - Translation of a genetic codon without a cognate tRNA gene is affected by both
      the cognate tRNA availability and the interaction with non-cognate isoacceptor
      tRNAs. Moreover, two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much
      slower translation rate. Calculating the composition of host specific slow codons
      and slow di-codons in the viral protein coding sequences can predict the order of
      viral protein synthesis rates between different virus strains. Comparison of
      human-specific slow codon and slow di-codon compositions in the genomes of 590
      coronaviruses infect humans revealed that the protein synthetic rates of 2019
      novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may be much faster than other coronaviruses infect humans.
      Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon compositions provides links
      between viral genomic sequences and capability of virus replication in host cells
      that may be useful for surveillance of the transmission potential of novel
      viruses.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to prevent cross-infection in the
      operating room during emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or
      suspected 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by following anesthesia management
      protocols, and to document clinical- and anesthesia-related characteristics of
      these patients. DESIGN: This was a retrospective, multicenter clinical study.
      SETTING: This study used a multicenter dataset from 4 hospitals in Wuhan, China. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Patients and health care providers with confirmed or suspected
      2019-nCoV from January 23 to 31, 2020, at the Wuhan Union Hospital, the Wuhan
      Children's Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Fourth Hospital
      in Wuhan, China. INTERVENTIONS: Anesthetic management and infection control
      guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were
      drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
      Cross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced
      by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with
      laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23
      [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range
      4-78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with
      diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease.
      Twenty-five (68%) patients presented with lymphopenia, and 23 (62%) patients
      exhibited multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on computed tomography
      scanning. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that COVID 19-specific
      guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected
      2019-nCoV may effectively prevent cross-infection in the operating room. Most
      patients with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 presented with fever and dry cough 
      and demonstrated bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest
      computed tomography scans.

AB  - The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
      already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter
      of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative.
      Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%,
      this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly
      affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health
      system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are
      infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of
      patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 
      2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively
      infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows
      an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30
      000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up 
      to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help 
      political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including 
      personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the
      next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in
      Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to
      decrease within 3-4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this
      cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing
      measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in
      December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health
      agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. METHODS:
      Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2
      test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after
      the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring
      for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough,
      or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for
      SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel
      contacts were also tested. FINDINGS: Patient 1-a woman in her 60s-returned from
      China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia
      and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but
      had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347
      underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195
      health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under
      investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and
      all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
      INTERPRETATION: Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two 
      people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic.
      Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some
      asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected. FUNDING: None.

AB  - The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global
      public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report
      our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed 
      (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host
      cell adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of 
      spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and
      camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our study
      also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein
      potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for
      hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique features of
      COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread
      rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 100,000 confirmed infections and
      4000 fatalities (as of 10 March 2020). The outbreak has been declared a pandemic 
      by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in
      transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine
      diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic
      coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for
      SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of
      different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show 
      that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate
      regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021.
      Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation
      in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the 
      scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might
      be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but
      do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2
      should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global
      transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection
      control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave
      with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of
      opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: From December 2019 to February 2020, 2019 severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a serious outbreak of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Related clinical features are needed.
      METHODS: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan
      between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020.
      RESULTS: The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0),
      and 32 patients (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]),
      cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy 
      (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).
      As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five
      patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%. According to the lowest SpO2
      during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2>/=90% group (n=55) and the
      SpO2<90% group (n=14). All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2<90% group. Compared with
      SpO2>/=90% group, patients of the SpO2<90% group were older, and showed more
      comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c
      reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging
      rate and decrease the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to show
      frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a 
      mortality rate of 7.5%. Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are
      at higher risk of death.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) epidemic, caused by the severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from China. This virus 
      causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since then, there have been
      anecdotal reports of ocular infection. The ocular implications of human CoV
      infections have not been widely studied. However, CoVs have been known to cause
      various ocular infections in animals. Clinical entities such as conjunctivitis,
      anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis have been documented in feline
      and murine models. In this article, the current evidence suggesting possible
      human CoV infection of ocular tissue is reviewed. The review article will also
      highlight animal CoVs and their associated ocular infections. We hope that this
      article will serve as a start for further research into the ocular implications
      of human CoV infections.

AB  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle
      East since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, 
      a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province,
      China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the
      etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with
      international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid
      national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative
      strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee
      to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern
      (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV
      community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge 
      for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of
      standardized and approved point of care testing. This challenge will now be faced
      by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since both
      coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those patients should now be tested for 
      both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the continuing wide
      international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14
      days will be of less significance.

TI  - Early estimation of the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in mainland China: a
      data-driven analysis.

AB  - Background: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus
      [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2], named COVID-19, hit
      a major city of China, Wuhan in December 2019 and subsequently spread to other
      provinces/regions of China and overseas. Several studies have been done to
      estimate the basic reproduction number in the early phase of this outbreak, yet
      there are no reliable estimates of case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 to date.
      Methods: In this study, we used a purely data-driven statistical method to
      estimate the CFR in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Daily numbers of
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected from January 10 to 
      February 3, 2020 and divided into three clusters: Wuhan city, other cities of
      Hubei province, and other provinces of mainland China. Simple linear regression
      model was applied to estimate the CFR from each cluster. Results: We estimated
      that CFR during the first weeks of the epidemic ranges from 0.15% (95% CI:
      0.12-0.18%) in mainland China excluding Hubei through 1.41% (95% CI: 1.38-1.45%) 
      in Hubei province excluding the city of Wuhan to 5.25% (95% CI: 4.98-5.51%) in
      Wuhan. Conclusions: Our early estimates suggest that the CFR of COVID-19 is lower
      than the previous coronavirus epidemics caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
